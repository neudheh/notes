- Kinematics is the study of motion, a continuous change of position with time
## Distance and displacement
- ==Distance is the total length of the path travelled by a body, regardless of direction==
- It is a scalar quantity, meaning it has magnitude but no direction
- ==Displacement is the distance travelled in a straight line in a specified direction, from some reference point==
- It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction
- To define displacement, we need to fix a reference starting position which can be chosen arbitrarily
- We then have to decide on a sign convention, such as taking the right to be positive
## Speed and velocity
- ==Speed is the rate of change of distance travelled, or as the distance travelled per unit time== $$Speed = \frac{Distance\ travelled}{Time\ taken}$$
- Speed is a scalar quantity
- ==Velocity is the rate of change of displacement, or the change of displacement per unit time== $$Velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ displacement}{Time\ taken}$$
- Velocity is a vector quantity
- They both have an S.I. unit of metres per second ($ms^{-1}$)
### Average speed vs instantaneous velocity
- Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled over the total time taken $$Average\ speed = \frac{Distance\ travelled}{Time\ taken} = \frac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}$$
- Average velocity is defined as the total displacement over the total time taken $$Average\ velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ displacement}{Time\ taken} = \frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$$
- Instantaneous speed is the rate of change of distance with time  $$Instantaneous\ speed = \frac{dD}{dt}$$
- Instantaneous velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement $$Instantaneous\ velocity = \frac{ds}{dt}$$
## Acceleration
- ==Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, or as the change of velocity per unit time== $$Acceleration = \frac{Change\ in\ velocity}{Time\ taken} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
- Average acceleration is the total change in velocity over the total time taken $$Acceleration = \frac{Overall\ change\ in\ velocity}{Total\ time\ taken}$$
- Acceleration is a vector quantity
- Deceleration is when objects are slowing down (magnitude of velocity is decreasing), regardless of the direction of motion
- This is different of negative acceleration, which tells us the direction of acceleration with respect to a sign convention
## Graphs
| Type of graph     | Gradient     | Area          |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Displacement-time | Velocity     | -             |
| Velocity-time     | Acceleration | Displacement  |
| Acceleration      | -            | Velocity      |
## Equations of kinematics
- ==This only applies to uniform motion, where acceleration is constant==
- From $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v-u}{t}$, $$Equation\ 1: v = u + at$$
- From $Average\ Velocity = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)$, $$Equation\ 2: s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$$
- Substituting equation 1 into equation 2, $$Equation\ 3: s = ut +\frac{1}{2}at^2$$
- From equation 1, $t = \frac{v-u}{a}$
- Substituting into equation 3, $$Equation\ 4: v^2 = u ^2 + 2as$$
## Free fall in a gravitational field
### Without air resistance
- Downward acceleration due to gravity would be equal 9.81 $ms^{-2}$
### With air resistance
- A falling object will still accelerate downwards, but acceleration will not remain steady at 9.81 $ms^{-2}$
- The acceleration instead decreases until it eventually reaches zero, at which point the object is no longer accelerating and falls at a constant velocity called terminal velocity

**When the body first starts to fall from rest**
- The initial velocity is zero
- Since it is not moving, it does not experience any air resistance
- The only force acting on the body is gravity
- Acceleration would be equal to 9.81 $ms^{-2}$ downwards

**As the body gains velocity in the downward direction**
- It experiences increasing air resistance against its motion, in the upwards direction
- The net force it experiences $mg - F_{air}$
- The net force is smaller in magnitude than $mg$ alone

**Eventually, the velocity of the body is so large that air resistance it experiences is equal to the body's weight**
- Using $F = ma$,
	$mg - F_{air} = ma$
	$0 = ma$, as weight equals air resistance
	$a = 0$
- The body is falling at a constant velocity known as terminal velocity
## Projectile motion
- When an object is thrown into the air at an angle, it will follow a parabolic path/ trajectory
- As long as the object is not in contact with anything and air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity acting vertically downwards
- By newtons second law ($F = ma$), the only acceleration the object experiences is acceleration due to gravity, 9.81 $ms^{-2}$ vertically downwards
- Horizontally, the object's velocity is constant because horizontally, the object experiences no force
- Hence, ==horizontal motion is at a constant velocity, while vertical motion is under the acceleration of gravity==
### Trajectory of the object
- When air resistance is negligible, the trajectory is symmetrical about its highest point
- When air resistance is not negligible, the trajectory is no longer symmetrical, the object has a smaller range, and the highest point the object reaches is lower
- Vertically, due to air resistance, acceleration is not uniform, and vertical velocity is decreasing at a decreasing rate, causing it to reach the highest point earlier
- Horizontally, air resistance and the horizontal component of the force are both acting on the object
- Due to air resistance, horizontal velocity decreases at a decreasing rate, and is not constant
