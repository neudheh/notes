## Distance and displacement
- ==Distance is the total length of the path travelled by a body regardless of direction travelled==
- It is a scalar quantity (Magnitude but no direction)
- ==Displacement is the distance travelled in a straight line in a specific direction, form some reference point==
- It is a vector quantity (Magnitude and direction)
- To define displacement we need to decided on a sign convention, such as taking any movement to the right to be positive
## Speed and velocity
- ==Speed is the rate of change of distance travelled/ distance travelled per unit time==
- The 'per' is important here as it signals that speed is a ratio $$ Speed = \frac{Distance\ travlled}{Time\ taken}$$
- Speed is a scalar quantity
- ==Velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement/ change of displacement per unit time== $$Velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ displacement}{Time\ taken}$$
- Velocity is a vector quantity
- Both have an SI units of meters per second ($ms^{-1}$)
- Average speed is the total distance travelled over the total time taken$$Average\ speed = \frac{Distance\ travelled}{Time\ taken}$$
- Average velocity is the total displacement over total time taken $$Average\ Velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ displacement}{Time\ taken}$$
- Instantaneous speed is the rate of change of distance with time $$Instatnaneous\ speed = Instantaneous\ rate\ of\ change\ of\ distance\ travlled = \frac{dD}{dt}$$
- $D$ = distance, $T$ = Time
- Instantaneous velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time$$Instatnaneous\ velocity = Instantaneous\ rate\ of\ change\ of\ displacement = \frac{ds}{dt}$$
- $s$ = displacement, $T$ = Time
## Acceleration
- ==Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity/ change of velocity per unit time== $$Acceleration = \frac{Change\ in\ velocity}{Time\ taken} =\frac{dv}{dt}$$
- Average accelerations is the total change in velocity over the total time interval $$Average\ accceleration = \frac{Overall\ change\ in\ velocity}{Time\ taken}$$
- Deceleration refers to objects which are slowing down (magnitude of velocity decreasing), regardless of direction
- It is different from negative acceleration, which tells us the direction of acceleration with respect to a sign convention
- Acceleration is a vector quantity
- SI unit of meters per second squared ($ms^-2$)

## Equations of kinematics
- These equations only apply to uniform motion, where acceleration is constant
- From $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v-u}{t}$, $$Equation\ 1: v = u+ at$$
- As $Average\ velocity = \frac{v + u}{2}$, $$Equation\ 2: s = \frac{1}{2}(v+u)t$$
- Substituting 1 into 2, $$Equation\ 3: s = u + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
- From 1, $t = \frac{v-u}{a}$
- Substituting into 3,$$Equation\ 4: v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$
## Free fall
### Without air resistance
- A falling object will accelerate downwards at $9.81ms^{-2}$ due to gravity
### With air resistance
- A falling will object will still accelerated downwards, but acceleration will not remain steady at $9.81ms^{-2}$
- Acceleration will instead decrease until it eventually reaches zero
- When the object is no longer accelerating and is falling at a constant velocity, it is said to be at terminal velocity
- **When the body first starts to fall from rest,**
	- Initial velocity is zero
	- Since it is not moving, it does not experience any air resistance
	- The only force acting on it is gravity (its weight)
	- Hence, acceleration is $9.81ms^{-2}$ downwards
- **As the body gains velocity in the downwards direction,**
	- It experiences increasing air resistance in the upwards direction, against its direction of motion
	- Net force it experiences is $weight - air\ resistance$
	- This net force is smaller in magnitude than the weight alone
	- Applying $F= ma$, the acceleration is lesser than that when he body was at rest at the start
- **Eventually, the velocity of the body is so large that that the air resistance it experiences is equal to the body's weight**
	- Since the weight of the body is equal to air resistance, the object experiences no net force
	- Using $F= ma$, the body experiences no acceleration
	- It falls at a constant velocity known as terminal velocity
## Projectile motion
- When an object is thrown into the air at an angle to the ground, it will follow a parabolic path
- So as long as the object is not is contact with anything and air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on it is the force of gravity (its weight), which acts vertically downwards
- By newton's second law ($F= ma$), this means that the only acceleration to object experiences is the acceleration due to gravity, which is $9.81ms^{-2}$ vertically downwards
- Hence, ==horizontal motion is at a constant velocity, while vertical motion is under the acceleration of gravity==
### Trajectory of the object
- When air resistance is negligible, the trajectory is symmetrical about its highest point
- When there is air resistance, the trajectory is no longer symmetrical, has a smaller range, a lower highest point
- Vertically
	- Due to air resistance, acceleration is not uniform
	- The vertical velocity is decreasing at a decreasing rate
	- Causing it to reach the highest point earlier
- Horizontally,
	- Air resistance and the horizontal force are both acting on the object
	- Due to air resistance, horizontal velocity decreases at a decreasing rate, and is not constant
