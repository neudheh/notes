## Distance and displacement
- ==Distance is the total length of the path travelled by a body regardless of direction travelled==
- It is a scalar quantity, having magnitude but no direction
- Units of $m$
- ==Displacement is the total distance travelled in a straight line in a specific direction, from some reference point==
- It is a vector quantity, meaning it has both magnitude and direction
- Units of $m$
- To define displacement, we need to fix a reference starting position, and then choose a sign convention such as taking to the right to be positive
## Speed and velocity
- ==Speed is the rate of change of distance travelled, or the distance travelled per unit time== $$v = \frac{D}{t}$$
  - $v$: Speed ($ms^{-2}$), $D$: Distance travelled ($m$), $t$: Time ($s$)
- It is a scalar
- Units of $ms^{-1}$
- ==Velocity is the rate of change of displacement, or the change of displacement per unit time== $$v = \frac{s}{t}$$
- $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-2}$), $s$: Displacement ($m$), $t$: Time ($s$)
- It is a vector
- Units of $ms^{-1}$
- Average speed is the total distance travelled over the total time taken ($v = \frac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}$)
- Average velocity is the total displacement over the total time taken ($v = \frac{\Delta S}{\Delta t}$)
- Instantaneous speed is the rate of change of distance with time ($v = \frac{dD}{dt}$)
- Instantaneous velocity is the rate of change of displacement with time ($v = \frac{dS}{dt}$)
## Acceleration
- ==Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity, or the change of velocity per unit time== $$a = \frac{v}{t}$$
- $a$: Acceleration ($ms^{-2}$), $v$: Velocity ($ms^-1$), $t$: Time ($s$)
- It is a scalar
- Units of $ms^{-2}$
- Average acceleration is the total change in velocity over the total time interval ($a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$)
- Deceleration is when objects are slowing down (magnitude of velocity is decreasing), regardless of the direction of motion
- This is different of negative acceleration, which tells us the direction of acceleration is negative with regard to the sign convention (the body is going backwards)
### Displacement-time graph

| Graph             | Gradient     | Area         |
| ----------------- | ------------ | ------------ |
| Displacement-time | Velocity     | -            |
| Velocity-time     | Acceleration | Displacement |
| Accleration-time  | -            | Velocity     |
### Equations of kinematics
- These equations only apply when acceleration is constant
- From $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v - u}{t}$, $$v = u +at$$
- From $Average\ velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ displacement}{Time\ taken}$, $$s = \frac{1}{2} (u +v)t$$
- Since $v = u + at$, $$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
- From $a = \frac{v-u}{t}$, $t = \frac{v-u}{a}$, hence $$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$
## Acceleration in free fall
### Without air resistance
- A falling object will accelerate downwards at an constant acceleration of $9.81ms^{-2}$
### With air resistance
- With air resistance, a falling object will accelerate downwards, but not at a steady rate of $9.81ms^{-2}$
- The acceleration will decrease until it eventually reaches zero
- At this point, the object is no longer accelerating and falls at constant velocity, known as terminal velocity
- When a body first starts to fall from rest
	- Its initial velocity is zero, and since it is not movie, it does not experience any air resistance
	- Hence, the only force acting on it is the force of gravity (its weight)
	- Acceleration is $9.81ms^{-2}$
- As the body gains velocity,
	- It experiences increasing air resistance against its motion, in the upwards direction
	- Hence, the net force it experiences is $mg - F_{air}$
	- The net force is smaller in magnitude than $mg$ alone
	- Applying $F=ma$, $mg - F_{air} = ma \rightarrow a = g - \frac{F_{air}}{m}$, which is lesser than $9.81ms^{-2}$
- Eventually, the velocity of the body is so large that the air resistance it experiences is equal to the body's weight
	- Using $F=ma$, $mg - F_{air} = ma \rightarrow 0 = ma \rightarrow a = 0$
	- The body is falling at a constant velocity known as terminal velocity
## Projectile motion
- When an object is thrown into the air at an angle, it will follow a parabolic path/ trajectory
- As long as the object is not in contact with anything and air resistance is negligible, the only force acting on the object is the force of gravity vertically downwards
- By newton's second law, the only acceleration the object experiences is acceleration due to gravity $9.81ms^{-2}$ vertically downwards
- Horizontally, the object's velocity is constant, becuase the object experiences no force horizontally
- Hence, ==horizontal motion is at a constant velocity, while vertical motion is under the acceleration of gravity==
### Trajectory of the object
- When air resistance is negligible, the trajectory is symmetrical about its highest point
- When air resistance is not negligible, the trajectory is no longer symmetrical, the object has a smaller range and the highest point the object reaches is lower
- Vertically, due to air resistance, acceleration is not uniform, and vertical velocity is decreasing at a decreasing rate, causing it to reach the highest point earlier
- Horizontally, air resistance and the horizontal component of the force are both acting on the object
- Due to air resistance, horizontal velocity decreases at a decreasing rate, and is not constant
