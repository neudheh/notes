## Law of universal gravitation
- ==Every two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ attract each other with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of their distance $r$ apart==$$$F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
- $F$: Force
- $m_1$ and $m_2$: Masses
- $r$: distance between $m_1$ and $m_2$ (Not radius)
- $G$: Gravitational constant
- Units of Newtons ($N$)
- This law is an example of an inverse square law
>[!NOTE]
>This is the graph for an inverse square law, where the vertical axis is $F$ and the horizontal axis is $r$
>![[inverse square law.png]]
- Gravitational attraction between any two objects is mutual, and form an action-reaction pair
- As it is a force, it must be added vectorially if two or more forces are acting on it
## Gravitational field
- A gravitational field is a ==region of space in which an object with mass experiences a gravitational force==
- The strength of the field can be represented by gravitational field lines
### Gravitational field lines
- Solid lines
- The close to lines are to one another, the stronger the field
- Do not cross one another
- Point in the direction gravity acts
- Two lines that cross each other must be added vectorially to get the resultant field
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- Near the surface of the earth, the lines of force are nearly parallel and equal distance apart to each other
- The gravitational field is said to be uniform
![[gravitational field lines near the surface of the earth.gif]]
### Gravitational field strength
- Gravitational field strength at a point in a gravitational field is the ==force per unit mass acting on any mass placed at that point== $$g = \frac{F}{m} = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
- $g$: Gravitational field strength
- $F$: Gravitational force
- $m$: Small mass
- $M$: Big mass
- $r$: Distance between two masses
- Units of Newton per Kg ($N Kg^{-1}$)
- It is also the acceleration due to gravity, causing it to also have units of meters per second squared ($m s^{-2}$)
- $g$ is a vector as an object with mass will experience a force in the same direction as the gravitational field strength
### Gravitational field strength inside an object surface
- For $r > R$, where $r$ is the distance between the two masses and $R$ is the radius of the earth$$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$$$g \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
- For $r < R$,
	- Considering a point P inside the earth at a distance $r$ from its centre$$g = \frac{GM_1}{r^2}$$
	- $g$: Gravitational field strength
	- $M_1$: Mass after point P
	- $r$: Distance from point p to the centre
	- Only the mass after point P needs to be considered due to Shell's Theorem
	- Assuming earth is of uniform density,$$g = \frac{G(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho)}{r^2}$$$$g = \frac{4}{3}G\pi \rho r$$$$g \propto r$$

## Satellite motion
- For a satellite of mass $m$, the gravitational force $F_G$ provides the centripetal force needed for circular motion$$F_G = F_C$$
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
### Geostationary satellites
- A geostationary satellite is a satellite that is in circular orbit **above the equator of the earth**, and **moving in the same direction as the earths rotation** (West -> East) with a **period exactly equal to the period of earth** as it turns about its axis (24 hours)
- It is also known as a relay orbit/ parking orbit
### Weightlessness in orbit
- When the normal contact force is zero on a person, one appears to be weightless
![[weightlessness in orbit.png]]
- Let the total mass of the space craft and astronaut be $M_s$, and the earth be $M$$$F_G = F_C$$$$\frac{GMM_s}{r^2} = M_sr\omega^2$$$$\frac{GM}{r^2} = r\omega ^2$$
- Now we consider the astronaut alone, and let his mass be $m$$$F_G - N = F_C$$$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} - N = mr\omega ^2$$$$N = 0$$
- As $N= 0$, the astronaut appears to be weightless
### Kepler's third law
- Consider a satellite of mass $M$ orbiting around the earth, which has mass $M$
$$F_G = F_C$$
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = mr\omega ^2$$

$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = mr(\frac{2 \pi}{T}) ^2$$
$$T^2 = \frac{4\pi ^2}{GM}r^3$$
$$T^2 \propto r^3$$
### Binary stars
- A binary star system is one where two stars rotate about their common centre of mass
- The centre of mass is closer to the heavier planet
- They will have to have the same periods
- If they do not have the same period, the line between them will not pass through through $O$, the centre of rotation, and the resultant gravitational force on each star, which is the centripetal force will not be directed at $O$
![[why binary stars have the same period.png]]
- There is no mass at the common centre of mass
- Finding the period of rotation $T$
	- Consider two binary stars rotating around each other
	![[binary stars.png]]
	- The larger one has a mass $M_1$ and has an orbit with a radius of $R_1$
	- The smaller one has a mass $M_2$ and has an orbit with a radius of $R_2$
	- The distance between both plants is $R1 +R2$, so the gravitational force is $$F_G = \frac{GM_1M_2}{(R_1 + R_2)^2}$$which is the same for both
	- Since they both have the same angular velocity $\omega$, $$For\ M_1:F_{CM_1} = M_1R_1\omega^2$$$$For\ M_2:F_{CM_2} = M_2R_2\omega^2$$
	- Since $F_G = F_C$, ![[period for binary stars.png]]
## Gravitational potential energy
- ==Gravitational potential energy is the work done by an external agent in bringing a test mass from infinity to the point, without a change in kinetic energy (with infinity taken as the zero reference)==$$U = -\frac{GMm}{r}, r \ge R $$
- $U$: Gravitational potential energy
- $M$: Big mass
- $m$: Small mass
- $r$: Distance
- The negative sign 
	- implies the attractive nature of the gravitational field
	- implies that the  mass $m$ is bound by the gravitational field of $M$
	- Is required as infinity taken as the zero reference (GPE is always lost when travelling from infinity)
- Scalar
- Units of Joules, ($J$)
### Escape speed
- Escape speed is the minimum speed that will just allow the object to escape to infinity (go to infinity with zero kinetic energy at the end)
- For an object to escape, the object must have enough kinetic energy, which will be converted to gravitational potential energy$$Loss\ in\ KE = Gain\ in\ GPE$$
$$Initial\ KE - Final\ KE = Final\ GPE - Initial\ GPE$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc} - 0 = 0 - (-\frac{GMm}{r})$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{esc} = \frac{GMm}{r}$$
$$V_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$$
- No need to memorise, just derive
## Gravitational potential
- The gravitational potential at a point is the work done per unit mass by an external agent in bringing an object from infinity to the point$$\phi = -\frac{GM}{r}, r \ge R $$
- $\phi$: Gravitational potential 
- $M$: Big mass
- $r$: Distance
- An object regardless of its mass will move from a position of high potential to one of low potential
>[!NOTE]
>Just imagine a ball on a hill when looking at potential graphs
- Scalar
- Units of ($J Kg^{-1}$)
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- The potential at all points with the same radius from the planet will be equal and are called equipotential lines (dotted lines)
- Field lines and equipotential lines are perpendicular to each other
- Different radii have different potentials
- Two or more potentials can be simply added together, direction does not need to be considered as potential is a scalar
- To get the resultant potential graph, we can add two potential graphs together
![[addition of potential graphs.png]]

## Energy in satellite orbits
- The total energy of a satellite of mass $m$ moving with a speed of $v$ in an orbit of radius $r$ around the earth of mass $M$ is$$E_{tot} = KE + GPE$$
$$E_{tot} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 + (- \frac{GMm}{r})$$
- For circular motion,$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
$$mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}$$
$$KE = \frac{GMm}{2r}$$
$$E_{tot} = \frac{GMm}{2r} + (- \frac{GMm}{r}) = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$$

## Relationships
- The gradient of a $U-r$ graph is the negative of the gravitational force acting on the object
- The area under a $F-r$ graph is the change in the gravitational potential energy
![[F - U relationship.png]]
- The gradient of a $\phi - r$ graph is the negative of the gravitational field strength
- The area under of a $g-r$ graph is the change in value of the gravitational potential
