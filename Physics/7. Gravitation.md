## Law of universal gravitation
- ==Every two particles with masses M and m attract each other with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely to the square of their distance apart==  $$F = \frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
- $F$: Gravitational force ($N$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass of the bigger particle ($kg$), $m$: mass of the smaller mass ($kg$), $r$: distance ($m$)
- Newton's law of gravitation is an inverse square law
- The expression is only valid for point masses (or particles)
- But, for a point outside uniform spheres, the sphere behaves as a point mass, with its mass concentrated at the centres
- Gravitational attraction between any two points is mutual, and they make up an action-reaction pair (Newton's third law)
- Addition of forces must be added vectorially if two or more forces are acting on an object

## Gravitational field
- ==A gravitational field of force is the region of space where an object with mass experiences a gravitational force==
- The strength of the field is represented by the symbol g
- g  is also the acceleration due to gravity
- The strength of the gravitational field can be represented by gravitational field lines
### Gravitational field lines
- The closer the lines are to each other, the stronger the field
- They do not cross one another
- They point in the direction gravitational force acts
- Two field lines that cross each other must be added vectorially to get the resultant filed
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- They point towards the centre of the mass producing the field
- Closer to the planet, the g-field lines are more closely spaced, signalling a stronger g-field strength
- Further away from the planet, the g-field lines are more widely spaced, signalling a weaker g-field strength
- The dashed circular concentric lines represent the gravitational equipotential line, where each lines joins together points with the same gravitational potential
- The gap between each line grows wider apart the further from the planet
![[gravitational field lines near the surface of the earth.png]]
- Near the surface of the earth, the gravitational field lines are nearly parallel to one another, and can be treated as a uniform field
- ==The gravitational field strength at a point in a gravitational field is defined as the force per unit mass acting on any mass placed at that point== $$g=\frac{F}{m}$$
- If the field is caused by a central mass M, the equation $$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$
- Where $g$: Gravitational field strength ($N kg^{-1}$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass of the bigger particle ($kg$), $r$: distance ($m$)
- $g$ is a vector, and an object with mass will experience a gravitational force in the same direction as $g$
### Gravitational field strength and depth
- Let the mass and radius of the earth be $M$ and $R$ respectively
- For $r > R$, $$g = \frac{GM}{r^2}$$ $$g \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
- For $r < R$, consider a point P inside the earth at a distance $r$ from the centre
- Assuming the earth has a uniform density, according to shell's theorem, the field at P is due to the mass $M'$ within the shaded region of earth, hence $$g = \frac{gM'}{r^2}$$ $$g = \frac{G(\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3 \rho)}{r^2}$$ $$g = \frac{4}{3}G\pi\rho r$$$$g \propto r$$
- This is assuming if the earth has a uniform density

## Satellite motion
- Satellites around the earth orbit at a speed known as the orbital speed, which is independent of the mass of the satellite but dependent on orbital radius
- To find the orbital speed, we have to consider the forces acting on the satellite
- The gravitational force on the satellite provides the centripetal force for its circular motion, hence $$F_G = F_C$$ $$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$$$\frac{GM}{r} = v^2$$
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}$$
### Geostationary satellites
- Geostationary satellites are satellites that are in circular orbit above the equator of the earth, moving in the same direction as earth's rotation (west to east), and have a period that is equal to the period of the earth as it turns about its axis, 24 hours
>[!NOTE]
>Distance from the earth is also the same!!!
>$$F_G =F_C$$
>$$mr\omega ^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}$$
>$$r\omega^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$
>$$r^2 = \frac{GM}{\omega^2}$$
>$$r = \sqrt{\frac{GM}{\omega^2}}$$
>- As $M$ and $\omega$ is the sane, $r$ is the same

### Weightlessness
- When a spacecraft is in circular orbit around a planet, the astronaut looses contact with the floor of the shuttle, and appears the be weightless
- In other words, the normal contact force $N = 0$, causing the astronaut to appear to be weightless
- Let the total mass of the spacecraft and astronaut be $m$, and the mass of the earth is $M$
- For satellite motion, gravitational force is equal to centripetal force
$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = mr\omega^2$$$$\frac{GM}{r^2} = r\omega^2$$
- Now considering the astronaut alone, whose mass is $m_a$, there is gravitational force and normal force acting on him $$\frac{GMm_a}{r^2} - N = m_ar\omega^2$$- Substituting the first equation, $$\frac{GMm_a}{r^2} - N = \frac{GMm_a^2}{r^2}$$$$N = 0$$
### Kepler's third law
- Consider a planet of mass $m$ orbiting around the sun of mass $M$, with the distance form the sun and the planet as $r$
- For satellite motion, gravitational force is equal to centripetal force $$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = mr\omega ^2$$$$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = mr(\frac{2\pi}{T})^2$$$$T = \frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$
- Kepler's third law states that for a mass orbiting a larger mass, the period and radius can be defined as $$T^2 \propto r^3$$
### Binary stars
- A binary star system is one where two stars rotate about their common centre of mass
- The center of mass is closer to the heavier planet
- They will orbit about the centre of mass with the same period so that the magnitude of gravitational force stays the same
- If they do not have the same period, the line between them will not pass through $O$, the centre of rotation, and the resultant gravitational force on each star, which is the centripetal force, will not be directed at $O$
![[why binary stars have the same period.png]]
- There is no mass at the common centre of mass
- Consider two binary stars rotating around each other
![[binary stars.png]]
- The larger one has a mass $M_1$, and an orbit of radius $R_1$
- The smaller one has a mass $M_2$, and an orbit of radius $R_2$
- The distance between the two planets is $R_1 + R_2$, so the gravitational force for both planets is $$F_G = \frac{GMm}{(R_1 + R_2)^2}$$
- Since they both have the same angular velocity $\omega$, $$For\ M_1: F_{CM_1} = M_1R_1\omega^2,\ For\ M_2: F_{CM_2} = M_2R_2\omega^2$$![[period for binary stars.png]]
## Gravitational potential energy
- ==Gravitational potential energy is the work done by an external agent in bringing a test mass from infinity to the point without a change in kinetic energy (with infinity taken as the zero reference)== $$U = -\frac{GMm}{r}$$
- $U$: Gravitational potential energy ($J$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass of the bigger particle ($kg$), $m$: mass of the smaller mass ($kg$), $r$: distance ($m$)
- The negative sign is used to show that energy is being taken from the object as a gravitational field is attractive
- It also implies that the test mass $m$ is bound by the gravitational field of $M$
- It is required due to taking infinity as the zero reference, as GPE is los when distance decreases
### Escape speed
- For an object to escape (go to infinity and still posses a non-zero KE), the object must have enough kinetic energy to convert to gravitational potential energy
- The loss in kinetic energy is equal to the gain in potential energy $$Loss\ in\ kinetic\ energy = Gain\ in\ gravitational\ potential\ energy$$$$Initial\ KE - Final\ KE = Final\ GPE - Initial\ GPE$$$$\frac{1}{2}mv^2 - 0 = 0 - (-\frac{GMm}{r})$$$$\frac{1}{2}v^2 = \frac{GM}{r}$$$$v = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}$$
- Escape speed is the minimum speed to just allow an object to escape to infinity
## Gravitational potential
- ==Gravitational potential at a point is the work done per unit mass by an external agent in bringing an object from infinity to the point== $$\phi = -\frac{GM}{r}$$
- Where $\phi$: Gravitational potential ($Jkg^{-1}$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67 \times 10^{-11} Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass of the bigger particle ($kg$), $r$: distance ($m$)
- An object regardless of its mass, will on its own accord move from a position of high potential to low potential, due to a gravitational force

>[!NOTE]
>Just imagine a ball on a hill when looking at potential graphs

- It is a scalar
- Has a unit of joules per kilogram ($Jkg^{-1}$)
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- All the points on an equipotential line have the same gravitational potential
- The potential at all points with the same radius from the planet will all be equal
- Different radii have different potentials
- Field lines and equipotential lines are perpendicular to each other
![[addition of potential graphs.png]]
- To add potentials, we can simply add them, and do not need to consider direction as it is a scalar
- We can simply add two potential graphs together to get the resultant potential at each point
### Energy in satellite orbits
- The total energy of a satellite with mass $m$ moving at a speed $v$ in an orbit of radius $r$ around the earth of mass $M$ is $$E_{total} = KE + U$$$$E_{total} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2+(-\frac{GMm}{r})$$
- For the circular motion of the satellite in orbit $$\frac{GMm}{r^2} = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$$$\frac{GMm}{r} = mv^2$$$$\frac{GMm}{2r} = KE$$
- Therefore, $$E_{total} = \frac{GMm}{2r} - \frac{GMm}{r} = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$$
- The minus sign in the expression for total energy indicates that the system is a closed one
- The satellite has to be supplied with energy from an external source before it can tear away from the attraction of the earth
### Relationships
- The gradient of a $U-r$ graph is the negative of the gravitational force acting on the object
- The area under the $F-r$ graph is the change in gravitational potential energy $$F = -\frac{GMm}{r}, U =-\frac{GMm}{r} \rightarrow F = -\frac{dU}{dr}$$
![[F - U relationship.png]]
- The negative of the gradient of the $\phi-r$ graph  is the gravitational field strength at that point
- The area under the $g-r$ graph is the change in gravitational potential $$g = -\frac{GM}{r}, \phi =-\frac{GM}{r} \rightarrow g = -\frac{d\phi}{dr}$$
![[phi - g relationship.png]]
