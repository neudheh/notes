## Faraday's experiment
![[faraday's experiment.png]]
- When a permanent magnet is pushed into a solenoid connected to a galvanometer, the needle deflects to one side momentarily
- When the magnet is stationary, the galvanometer shows no deflection
- When the magnet is pulled out, there is a momentary deflection in the reverse direction
- When the experiment is repeated with twice the speed, the galvanometer has twice the degree of deflection, and the induced current is doubled
![[faraday's experiment alternative.png]]
- When the switch is closed, a momentary induced current flow is set up with a deflection observed in the galvanometer
- When the switch is open, another momentary induced current flow is set up, but in the opposite direction
## Magnetic flux and flux linkage
- ==The magnetic flux passing through a surface area is the product of the surface area and the component of the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the surface area==
  $$\phi=BA\cos\theta$$
- $\phi$: Magnetic flux ($Wb$), $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $A$: Surface area ($m^2$), $\theta$: Angle between the normal of the surface area and the magnetic field ($rad$)
![[magnetic flux.jpeg]]
- It has unit of Weber ($Wb$), which is the flux of a uniform magnetic field of flux density $1T$, through a plane of surface area $1m^2$ place normal to the field
- A metal core will have the same magnetic flux throughout
![[magnetic flux linkage.png]]
- The magnetic flux linkage of a coil is given by 
  $$\Phi=NBA\cos\theta$$\
- $\Phi$: Flux linkage ($Wb$), $N$: Number of turns, $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $A$: Surface area ($m^2$), $\theta$: Angle between the normal of the surface area and the magnetic field ($rad$)
## Faraday's and Lenz's law
- ==Faraday's law states that that when the magnetic flux linkage within a circuit is changed, an induced e.m.f. is set up whose magnitude is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage==
  $$E\propto\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$
- ==Lenz's law states that when an e.m.f. is generated by a change in magnetic flux according to Faraday's law, the polarity of the induced e.m.f. is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it==
  $$E=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}$$
- $E$: E.m.f. ($V$), $\Phi$: Magnetic flux linkage ($Wb$), $t$: Time ($s$)

### Conservation of energy
- Lenz's law is a necessary consequence of the conservation of energy
![[Lenz's law.png]]
- Consider the that the solenoid circuit where a magnetic south pole is pushed into the coil, causing a south pole to be produced at A to oppose the approaching magnet
- If a N-pole is produced at A, the magnet will then be accelerated towards the coil after the initial push
- No further work done is required by the external agent to maintain the initial push
- Electrical energy can be continuously generated out of nothing
- In practise, work has to be done to maintain the motion of the magnet into the coil to overcome the opposing force form the magnetic south pole induced in the coil
- Thus, the law of conservation of energy is obeyed in which the work done in pushing the magnet is converted into electrical energy in the coil
### Eddy current and braking
- When a copper disc enters a magnetic field, induced or eddy currents are produced in the metal
- By Lenz's law, the eddy currents set up a magnetic field which opposes the field of the magnet, which opposes the motion of the disc
- Discs with open slots prevent the setting up of eddy currents and hence there is lesser opposition or damping of the motion
- Eddy currents may be used to critically damp the motion of coils in measuring instruments
## Examples
### Right hand rule
- This rule helps us to identify the direction of the induced e.m.f and hence current in a circuit
![[fleming's right hand rule.png]]

>[!NOTE]
>Easy trick to remember Fleming's right hand rule
>- The current will kill you, so its rude and is the middle finger
>- The force is always the big boi, and thus the thumb
>- Through elimination, the magnetic field is the index finger
### Straight conductor
![[straight conductor passing through magnetic field.png]]
- In time $\Delta t$, the area swept through by the rod is $vl\Delta t$
- From $E=\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=\frac{\Delta(BA)}{\Delta t}=\frac{Bvl\Delta t}{\Delta t}=Blv$
- Using Fleming's right hand rule, the current flows from Q to P
- QP acts like an e.m.f source, so Q has a higher potential than P
![[current carrying conductor in an electric field molecular.png]]
- Alternatively, as the rod is pushed to the right, the electrons experience a downward magnetic force ($F=BQv$)
- The deflection of charges from $P$ to due to the magnetic force leads to the establishment of a potential difference $V$ between P and Q
- Thus, there is a downward electric field $E$ in the rod
- The electron migration stops when $F_E=F_B\rightarrow \frac{qV}{l}=Bqv\rightarrow V=Blv$
### Faraday's disc
- When a disc is rotate with its plane perpendicular to a magnetic field $B$, an e.m.f. is induced between the axle and the rim of the disc
- Flux cut by the section OP in one revolution $\phi=BA=B(\pi r^2)$
- In 1 second, the disc is rotated at frequency $f$, hence $E=\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=\frac{B\pi r^2 f}{1}=B\pi r^2 f$

### AC generator
- For a coil of $N$ turns rotating with constant angular velocity $\omega$ in a uniform $B$ field, the flux linkage $\phi=NBA\cos\theta=NBA\cos(\omega t)$
- Thus, $E=-\frac{d\Phi}{dt}=-\frac{d}{dt}(NBA\cos(\omega t))=\omega NBA\sin(\omega t)=E_0\sin(\omega t)$
- $E_0$ is the peak e.m.f. value

![[graph of ac generator.png]]
- From the equation, the factors affecting the magnitude of e.m.f generated are
1. Number of coils
2. Angular frequency
3. Area of the coil
4. Magnetic flux density
