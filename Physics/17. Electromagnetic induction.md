## Faraday's experiment
![[faraday's experiment.png]]
- When a permanent magnet is pushed into a solenoid connected to a galvanometer, the needle deflects to one side momentarily
- When the magnet is stationary, there is no deflection
- On withdrawal of the magnet, the reverse momentary deflection is observed
- When the experiment is repeated with twice the speed, the galvanometer has twice the degree of deflection
![[faraday's experiment alternative.png]]
- When the switch is closed, a momentarily induced current flow is set up, with a deflection in the galvanometer
- When the switch is open, a momentary induced current is induced again, but in the opposite direction, as indicated by the galvanometer deflection
## Magnetic flux and flux linkage
- Magnetic flux density is a measure of the strength of the magnetic field
- Consider a magnetic field $B$ directed at an angle $\theta$ to the normal of a small elemental surface of an area $\Delta A$
![[magnetic flux.jpeg]]
- ==The magnetic flux passing through the surface area A is the product of the area A and the component of the magnetic flux density perpendicular to the area==
- It has the unit of Weber ($Wb$), which is the flux of a uniform magnetic field of flux density $1T$, through a plane surface of area $A$ of $1m^2$ placed normal to the field
- The component $B_\perp$ of the magnetic field normal to the surface is $B\cos\theta$ $$\phi = B_\perp A = BA\cos\theta$$
- Where $\phi$: Magnetic flux ($Wb$), $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $A$: Area ($m^2$), $\theta$: Angle between the magnetic field and the normal of the area ($rad$)
- A metal core will have the same magnetic flux throughout
![[magnetic flux linkage.png]]
- The magnetic flux passing through each turn of the coil is $$\phi = NBA\cos\theta$$
- Where $\phi$: Magnetic flux ($Wb$), $N$: Number of turns of the coil, $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $A$: Area ($m^2$), $\theta$: Angle between the magnetic field and the normal of the area ($rad$)
- The maximum flux linkage is at $\theta = 0$, where the plane of the coil is perpendicular to the field
- The minimum flux linkage is at $\theta = 90\degree$, Where the plane of the coil is parallel to the field
## Laws of electromagnetic induction
### Faraday's law
- ==Faraday's law states that when the magnetic flux linkage with a circuit is changed, an induced e.m.f. is set up, whose magnitude is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage== $$E\propto \frac{d\phi}{dt}$$
### Lenz's law
- ==Lenz's law states that when an e.m.f is generated by a change in magnetic flux, the polarity of the induced e.m.f is such that it produces a current whose magnetic field opposes the change which produces it== $$E =-\frac{d\phi}{dt}$$
- Where $E$: E.m.f ($V$), $\phi$: Magnetic flux ($Wb$), $t$: time($s$)

### Lenz's law and the conservation of energy
- Lenz's law is a necessary consequence of the conservation of energy
- Consider the solenoid circuit where a magnetic south pole is pushed into the solenoid, causing a S-pole to be produced at A to oppose the approaching magnet
![[Lenz's law.png]]
- If a N-pole was produced at A instead, the magnet will then be accelerated towards the coil after the initial push\
- No further work is done by the external agent to maintain the internal push, and electrical energy can be continuously be generated out of nothing
- In practise, work has to be done by the external agent to maintain the motion of the magnet into the coil to overcome the opposing force form the magnetic S-pole induced in the coil
- Thus, the law of conservation of energy is obeyed, in which the work done in pushing the magnet is converted into electrical energy in the coil
### Eddy current and braking
- When a copper disc enters a magnetic field, induced or eddy currents are produced in the metal
- By Lenz's law, the eddy current sets up a magnetic field which opposes the field of the magnet
- This tends to oppose the motion of the disc
- To prevent the setting up of induced currents, discs with open slots should be used, hence there would be lesser opposition or damping during the motion
- In some iron-cored apparatus such as transformers, eddy currents should be reduced to avoid wastage of energy
- This is because induced currents can cause joule heating, raising the temperature of the iron core
- But, eddy currents can be used to critically damp the motion of coils in measuring instruments like galvanometers
## Examples of EM induction
### Fleming's right hand rule
- This rule helps us to identify the direction of the induced e.m.f and hence current in a circuit
![[fleming's right hand rule.png]]

>[!NOTE]
>Easy trick to remember Fleming's right hand rule
>- The current will kill you, so its rude and is the middle finger
>- The force is always the big boi, and thus the thumb
>- Through elimination, the magnetic field is the index finger

### Straight conductor moving across a uniform field
![[straight conductor passing through magnetic field.png]]
- For a conductor of length $l$ moving with velocity $v$ perpendicular to a magnetic field $B$
- In time $\Delta t$, the area swept through is $$A = lv\Delta t$$
- From Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, $E =\frac{d\phi}{dt}$ $$E =\frac{\Delta BA}{\Delta t}$$$$E = \frac{Blv\Delta t}{\Delta t}$$$$E = Blv$$
- Using Fleming's right hand rule, current flows from $P$ to $Q$
- The conductor acts as an e.m.f. source, with terminal $Q$ at a higher potential than $P$
![[current carrying conductor in an electric field molecular.png]]
- Alternatively, as the rod is pushed to the right, the free electrons experience a downward force $F_B$
- The electrons of electrons to $P$ doe to $F_B$ will establish a potential difference between $P$ and $Q$, and hence a downward electric field $E$
- The electron migration stops when $$F_E = F_B$$$$q\frac{V}{l} = Bqv$$$$V = Blv$$
### Faraday's disc
![[faraday's disc.png]]
- When a disc is rotated with its plane perpendicular to a magnetic field $B$, an e.m.f is induced between the axle and the rim of the disc
 - Flux cut by the elemental section OP in 1 revolution $$\phi = BA = B(\pi r^2)$$
 - In one second, the disc rotate is at frequency $f$ $$E = \frac{d\phi}{dt} = \frac{B\pi r^2 f}{1}$$
### AC generation in a rotating coil
![[AC generator.png]]
- For a coil of $N$ turns with constant angular velocity $\omega$ in a uniform $B$ field,
- The flux linkage $\phi = NBA\cos\theta = NBA\cos\omega t$
- E.m.f induced $$E = -\frac{d\phi}{dt}$$$$E = -\frac{d(NBA\cos\omega t)}{dt}$$$$E = NBA\omega\sin\omega t = E_0\sin\omega t$$
- Where $E_0$: Maximum e.m.f. produced
![[graph of ac generator.png]]
- From the equation, the factors affecting the magnitude of e.m.f generated are
1. Number of coils
2. Angular frequency
3. Area of the coil
4. Magnetic flux density
