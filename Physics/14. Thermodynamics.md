## Internal energy
- ==The internal energy is the sum of the kinetic energy due to random movements of the particles, and potential energy due to the intermolecular forces between the particles  in the system== $$U = KE +PE$$
- Where $U$: Internal energy ($J$), $KE$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $PE$: Potential energy ($J$)
### Ideal gas
- Real gasses behave like an ideal gas at high temperature and low pressure
- Under such condition, the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes much less significant compared to molecular kinetic energy
- Therefore, the ideal gas does not have any ideal energy and the internal energy is purely translational kinetic energy of the molecules $$U = E_K = \frac{3}{2}NkT = \frac{3}{2}nRT$$
- $U$: Internal energy ($J$), $E_K$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $N$: Number of molecules, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$),  $T$: Temperature ($K$), $n$: Number of mol of molecules ($mol$),  $R$: molar gas constant ($8.31 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$) 
- Internal energy depends only on temperature and its thus a function of $T$
## Changes in internal energy
- Internal energy of a system is determined by only its state variables ($P$, $V$, $T$ values)
- The change in internal energy of a system does not depend on the path taken from one state to another
### Work done by a gas
![[Work done by a gas.png]]
- When a gas expands, the gas has to do work to push back the atmosphere
- The work done by the gas, under a constant external pressure, would be equal to $$W = pA \times\Delta x = p\Delta v$$

- When the gas contracts, then work is done on the gas $$W_{ON}= -W_{BY}=-p\Delta b$$
- Where $W$: Work done ($J$), $p$: Pressure ($N m^{-2}$), $A$: Area ($m^2$), $\Delta x$: Change in displacement, $\Delta v$: Change in volume ($m^3$)
- In general, as the gas volume changes, the pressure will not stay constant
- The overall work done is the area under the PV graph $$W = \int{pdv}=Area\ under\ PV\ graph$$
## First law of thermodynamics
- The first law of dynamics states that the increase in internal energy is equal to the sum of the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system $$\Delta U = Q+W_{ON}$$
- Where $\Delta U$: Change in internal energy ($J$), $Q$: Heat supplied to the system ($J$), $W_{ON}$: Work done on the gas ($J$)
- System gains internal energy -> $\Delta U$ is positive, System loses internal energy -> $\Delta U$ is negative
- Heat supplied to the system -> $Q$ is positive, heat extracted from the system -> $Q$ is negative
- Work done on the system -> $W_{ON}$ is positive, Work done by the system -> $W_{ON}$ is negative
### Isochoric (constant volume)
![[isochoric.png]]
- Area under the vertical line is zero, since volume is constant
- Therefore, the work done on the gas, $W =0$
- $\Delta U = Q+W  \rightarrow \Delta U = Q$
- All the heat absorbed or released by the system is use to increase or decrease the internal energy of the system
- Internal energy increases since temperature is increased
### Isobaric (constant pressure)
![[isobaric.png]]
- Work done by the system $W=-p\Delta V$
- Increase in internal energy $\Delta U = Q + W = Q -p\Delta V$
- Hence, $Q = \Delta U + p\Delta V$
- The heat supplied is used to increase the internal energy and do work in expansion
### Isothermal (constant temperature)
![[isothermal.png]]
- Change in internal energy $\Delta U$ is zero as temperature is constant
- First law $\Delta U=Q+W \rightarrow Q = -W$
- All of the heat supplied is work done by the system
### Adiabatic (no heat input)
![[adibatic.png]]
- An adiabatic process is one where no heat enters or leaves the system ($Q = 0$)
- The change of volume in a gas in an insulated container $\Delta U = Q+W  \rightarrow \Delta U = W$
### Cyclic
![[cyclic.png]]
- A cyclic process is one where the starting and end point of the process is the same
- At the end of the process, the gas is at the same state, therefore internal energy is the same
- $\Delta U = Q + W \rightarrow 0 = Q + W \rightarrow W = -Q$
- The net work done on the system is equal to the net heat removed form the system or vice versa
### Melting
- At the melting point, heat supplies is used to weaken the intermolecular bonds and increase the intermolecular separation slightly, increasing molecular potential energy
- The heat supplied not used to increase molecular kinetic energy, so temperature remains constant
- Volume of the substance hardly changes, so the work done is zero
- $\Delta U = Q = W \rightarrow \Delta U = Q$
- Heat supplied is equal to the increase in internal energy (only potential energy)
### Boiling
- Heat supplied is used to break the intermolecular bond leading to an increase in molecular potential energy
- As the liquid turns to a vapour, the volume is greatly increased as the molecules move further apart, leading to a further increase in potential energy
- The vapour does work as it pushes back into the atmosphere
- $\Delta U = Q + W  \rightarrow = Q = \Delta U - W$
- Heat supplied is equal to the increase in internal energy and the work done by the vapour
>[!NOTE]
>- In melting, the intermolecular bonds are only weakened, and the intermolecular separation hardly changes
>- In boiling, the intermolecular bonds are broken, and the intermolecular separation increases greatly
>- Therefore, $\Delta U$ and $W$ are much greater for boiling than melting
>- The specific latent heat of vaporisation is higher than fusion
### Evaporating
- Evaporation is similar to boiling as heat from the surrounding is absorbed to break intermolecular bonds and increase intermolecular separation
- This causes cooling of the surroundings
