## Physical quantity
- A physical quantity comprises of a numerical magnitude and a unit$$F= 5N$$
- In this case, $F$ is a force, which is a physical quantity, $5$ is the numerical magnitude, and $N$ is the unit
## Base units
- Base units are fundamental quantities, which cannot be expressed as a combination of simpler quantities
- SI units, which are the international system of units, is a standard system of units for the fundamental quantities of science
- Base units/ SI base units are units of the base quantities

|Base quantity|Base units|Symbol|
|-|-|-|
|Mass|Kilogram|kg|
|Length|Metre|m|
|Time|Second|s|
|Temperature|Kelvin|K|
|Electric current|ampere|A|
|Amount of substance|mole|mol|
|Luminous intensity|Candela|cd|
## Derived units
- Derived quantities are ==quantities that are derived from a combination of base quantities==
- E.g. $Speed =\frac{length}{time}$
- Derived units are ==units of derived quantities==
- They are obtained using the products or quotients of the base units
- Some derived quantities are unitless, such as refractive index
## Homogeneity
- For an equation to be homogenous, ==all the terms on both the left hand side and the right hand side must have the same units==
- But, it can only check for wrong equations
- Even if an equation is homogenous, we cannot be sure it is physically correct
## Prefixes
- Prefixes are useful for expressing units of physical quantities that are either very big or very small

### Estimation
- An estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantity based on prior experience and sound reasoning
- Estimates allow one to perform checks on calculations and rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic numbers
- We can also use other known quantities to estimate the physical value of an object
## Scalar and vector quantities
- A scalar quantity is a quantity that has magnitude but no direction
- E.g. mass, temperature, length, energy
- A vector quantity is a quantity that has magnitude and direction
- E.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration, force
## Vector addition
### Head to tail vectors
![[Tip to tail method.png]]
1. Position two vectors so that the head touches the tail
2. Connect the free tail of one vector and connect it to the free head of one vector to get the resultant vector
### Parallelogram method
![[parallelogram method.png]]
1. Position the two vector such that the head touches the tail
2. Draw a parallelogram and connect them together
### Adding several vectors

## Vector subtraction
- Vectors cannot be subtracted
- Instead, $A-B$ can be written as $A + -B$, which is the vector addition of $A$ of and $-B$, where $-B$ is just vector B pointing in the opposite direction
- Can be useful to find a change in a vector ($\Delta A = A_f - A_i$) or Vector $A$ relative to Vector $B$ ($A-B$)
## Vector resolution
- Resolution of a vector is the process of splitting a vector into two perpendicular components
- The components add up vectorially to give back the original vector
- The original vector will form the hypotenuse of the vector triangle
- The components are smaller than the original vector

## Measurement uncertainty
- All physical measurements are associated with some uncertainty, however small
- When using an instrument to measure any physical quantities, measurement uncertainty is inevitable due to the measuring instrument itself (instrumental uncertainty), and/ or the limitations of the observer or the method used (procedural uncertainty)
- ==Measurement error is the difference between a measured value and the true value of a quantity==
- It is important to communicate the reliability of the measurements in a clear standard format by explicitly stating the uncertainty of the measurement in the form or a range of value likely to enclose the true value
### Actual (absolute) uncertainty
- When expressing the uncertainty of a measurement, readings are expressed in the form ($R \pm \Delta R$ ), where $\Delta R$ is the actual uncertainty
- Actual uncertainty is always rounded off to one significant figure
- $R$ is then rounded off to the same decimal place as $\Delta R$
- For a scale reading, the uncertainty is half a division
- For a difference of two readings, the uncertainty is one division
## Fractional and percentage uncertainty
 - Fractional uncertainty of R is $\frac{\Delta R}{R}$
-  Fractional uncertainty of R is $\frac{\Delta R}{R} \times 100\%$
- It indicates the reliability of a chose instrument to measure a given quantity
## Precision and accuracy in instruments
### Precision
- The precision of an instrument refers to the smallest value he instrument can measure
- This is known as the limit of sensitivity
- For example, a metre rule can obtain length measurements with the precision of up to 0.1 cm while a micrometre screw gauge has a precision of up to 0.001 cm
- A micrometre is a more precise instrument compared to a metre rule
- Precision of an instrument can be reflected by the actual uncertainty of the instrument, the smaller the actual uncertainty, the more precise it is
### Accuracy
- The accuracy of an instrument refers to the capability of the instrument to reliably measure the true value of a physical quantity
- It depends on both the precision of the instrument and the magnitude of the quantity measured as well
- For example, using a metre rule of precision of 0.1cm, to measure a length of about 1.0 cm will incur a percentage uncertainty of 10%.
- However, using the same metre rule to measure lengths of up to 100cm will incur a percentage uncertainty of only 0.1%
- Accuracy of an instrument is reflected by the fractional/ percentage uncertainty of the instrument, the smaller the fractional/ percentage uncertainty, the more accurate it is 
## Systematic errors
- ==Systematic errors are errors of measurement that occur according to some fixed rule or pattern such that they yield a constant over or under estimation of the true value==
- The error is systematic if repeated measurements taken under the same conditions yield the same error in magnitude and sign; or the value changes in a predictable manner depending on the conditions
- Examples:
	- Zero readings (Zero error)
	- Faulty instruments (Stopwatch that runs fast)
	- Wrong assumption (wrong value of g)
	- Wrong experimental technique (poor skills in reading instruments)
## Random errors
- ==Random errors are unpredictable errors with different magnitude and sign in repeated measurements==
- Errors have an equal chance of being positive or negative
- Examples
	- Variation in the condition of measuring instruments
	- Variation arising from the inability of an observer to measure small intervals
	- Variation due to fluctuation external conditions (air pressure, temperature)
	- Irregularities of a quantity to be measured (Small fluctuations in the diameter of a wire)
- As they have an equal probability of getting a positive or negative error, these errors will tend to offset each other statistically
- By taking a number of repeated readings and finding the average, we can statistically reduce random errors
>[!NOTE]
>Taking the average will reduce random error, but not the actual uncertainty of the value
>To do so, we may take more bounces of the ball, swings on the pendulum as the uncertainty in the time measured is reduced, and divided across more readings, reducing the uncertainty

## Precision and accuracy in data readings
- ==Precision refers to the closeness of measured values to another, regardless of the actual value==
- Precision is related to random error
- Repeating the measurements reduces the uncertainty of the average value obtained, because of the statistics of averaging
- ==Accuracy refers to the closeness of measured values to a standard or known value==
- Accuracy is related to systematic error
- We can recalibrate instruments or re-examine the experimental method used to reduce systematic error
## Uncertainties of derived quantities
### Addition and subtraction
- The consequential uncertainty is the sum of the absolute uncertainties$$\Delta R = \Delta R_1 + \Delta R_2 +...$$
### Multiplication and division
- The consequential fractional uncertainty is the sum of the individual fractional uncertainties
$$\frac{\Delta R}{R} = \frac{\Delta R_1}{R_1} + \frac{\Delta R_2}{R_2} + ...$$
>[!NOTE]
>- When dividing by a whole number e.g. $P = \frac{Q}{N}$, where N is the whole number,
>	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P}= \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} + \frac{\Delta N}{N}$
>	- N is a number so $\Delta N = 0$
>	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P}= \frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- $\Delta P= P\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- Since $P = \frac{Q}{N}$, $\Delta P= \frac{Q}{N}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- $\Delta P= \frac{Q}{N}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	-  $\Delta P= \frac{\Delta Q}{N}$
>When multiplying by a whole number, e.g. $P = QN$, where N is the whole number 
 >	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} + \frac{\Delta N}{N}$
 >	- N is a number, so $\Delta N = 0$ 
 >	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- ${\Delta P} = {P}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- Since $P = QN$, ${\Delta P} = {QN}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- ${\Delta P} = N \Delta Q$
 
### Other generalisations
- If $R=y^n$ then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = n\frac{\Delta y}{y}$
- If $R = p^m \times q^n$, then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = m\frac{\Delta p}{p}+ n\frac{\Delta q}{q}$
- If $R = \frac{p^m}{q^n}$, then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = m\frac{\Delta p}{p}+ n\frac{\Delta q}{q}$
### Numerical substitution
- When the calculation is a mixture of both summation and multiplication of measurements, or involves non linear functions such as sin, cos, ln, we will just use numerical substitutions$Uncertainty = \frac{Maximum\ value\ of\ derived\ quanitity - Minimum\ value\ of derived quantity}{2}$
