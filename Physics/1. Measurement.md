## Physical quantity
- A physical quantity made up of a numerical magnitude and a unit $$F = 5N$$
- $F$ (force) is the physical quantity, $5$ is the numerical magnitude, and $N$ (newtons) is the unit
### Base units
- Base quantities are fundamental quantities, which cannot be expressed as a combination of simpler quantities
- SI Base units are units of the base quantities

| Base quantitity     | Base units | Symbol |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------ |
| Mass                | kilogram   | $kg$   |
| Length              | metre      | $m$    |
| Time                | second     | $s$    |
| Temperature         | kelvin     | $K$    |
| Current             | ampere     | $A$    |
| Amount of substance | mole       | $mol$  |
| Luminous intensity  | Candela    | $cd$   |
### Derived units
- Derived quantities are quantities that are derived from a combination of base quantities
- Derived units are units of derived quantities, and can be obtained by using the products or quotients of the base units

| Quantitiy | Derivation                           | Base Units    | SI Unit   |
| --------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------- | --------- |
| Volume    | $length \times length \times length$ | $m^3$         | $m^3$     |
| Speed     | $distance\times time$                | $ms^{-1}$     | $ms^{-1}$ |
| Force     | $mass\times accleration$             | $kgms^{-2}$   | $N$       |
| Work      | $force \times distance$              | $kgm^2s^{-2}$ | $J$       |
- Some derived units are unitless, such as refractive index
### Homogeneity
- For an equation to be homogenous, all the terms on the left and side and right hand side must have the same units
- But, this can only check for wrong equations
- Even if a equation is homogenous, we cannot be sure that it is physically correct
### Prefixes
- Prefixes are used to express units of physical quantities that are very big or very small

| Factor     | Prefix | Symbol |
| ---------- | ------ | ------ |
| $10^{12}$  | terra  | $T$    |
| $10^{9}$   | giga   | $g$    |
| $10^{6}$   | mega   | $M$    |
| $10^{3}$   | kilo   | $k$    |
| $10^{-1}$  | deci   | $d$    |
| $10^{-2}$  | centi  | $c$    |
| $10^{-3}$  | mili   | $m$    |
| $10^{-6}$  | micro  | $\mu$  |
| $10^{-9}$  | nano   | $n$    |
| $10^{-12}$ | pico   | $p$    |
### Estimation
- An estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantities based on prior experience and sound physical reasoning
- They allow us to check calculations to rule out certain scenarios or unrealistic numbers
## Scalar and vector quantities
- A scalar quantity has magnitude but no direction (e.g. mass, temperature, length, energy)
- A vector quantity has magnitude and direction (e.g. displacement, velocity, acceleration, force)
### Vector addition
#### Head to tail method
![[Tip to tail method.png]]
1. Position the two vectors such that the head touches the tail of the next vector
2. Draw the resultant vector from the tail of one vector to the head to the head of another
#### Parallelogram method
![[parallelogram method.png]]
1. Position the two vector such that the head touches the tail
2. Draw a parallelogram and connect them together
#### Several vectors

### Vector subtraction
- Vectors cannot be subtracted, so instead we write $A-B$ as $A + (-B)$, where $-B$ is $B$ but in the opposite direction
- Can be used to find
	- Vector $A$ relative to $B$ ($A-B$)
	- Change in vector $A$ ($A_f - A_i$)
### Vector resolution
- Vector resolution is to split a vector into two perpendicular components, which add up vectorially to give back the original vector
- The original vector forms the hypotenuse of the vector triangle, and the components are smaller than the original vector

## Measurement uncertainty
- Measurement uncertainty is inevitable due to the measuring instrument (instrumental uncertainty), or the limitations of the observer/ method used (procedural uncertainty)
- Hence, there is uncertainty in all measurements, causing the measured value to deviate from the true or correct value
- Measurement error is the difference between a measured value and the true value of a quantity
- It is important to communicate the reliability of measurements in a clear standard format 
- We do so by stating the uncertainty of the measurement in the form of a range of value likely to enclose the true value
### Actual uncertainty
- The uncertainty of a measurement is represented by $$(R \pm\Delta R)$$
- Where $\Delta R$ is the actual uncertainty
- The actual uncertainty is always rounded off to one significant figure only, and the value $R$ must have the same decimal place as $\Delta R$
### Fractional uncertainty
- The fractional uncertainty of an instrument is given by $$\frac{\Delta R}{R}$$
- The percentage uncertainty of an instrument is given by$$\frac{\Delta R}{R} \times 100\%$$
- Fractional uncertainty is used to indicate the reliability of a chosen instrument to measure a given quantity
### Precision and accuracy in instruments
- Precision of an instrument is the smallest value the instrument can measure, which is also known as the limit of sensitivity of a measuring instrument
- Reflected by the actual uncertainty of the instrument, the smaller the actual uncertainty, the more precise it is
- E.g. Meter rule can measure up to $0.1cm$ while micrometer can measure up to $0.001cm$, making it more precise
- Accuracy of an instrument is the capability of the instrument to reliably measure the true value of a physical quantity
- Depends on both the precision of instrument, and the magnitude of the quantity measured as well
- Reflected by the percentage uncertainty, the smaller the percentage uncertainty, the more accurate
## Systematic errors
- ==Systematic errors are errors of measurements that occur according to some fixed rule or pattern such that they yield a consistent over or under-estimation of the true value==
- The error is systematic if 
	- repeated measurements taken under the same conditions yield the same error in magnitude and sign
	- value changes in a predictable manner according to the conditions
- E.g. Zero error, faulty instruments, wrong assumptions, wrong experimental technique'
- Can be reduced by recalibrating instruments or changing the experimental technique
- Cannot be reduced by taking the average as a consistent amount of error of the same sign is introduced in each repeated experiment
## Random errors
- Random errors are unpredictable errors with different magnitude and sign in repeated measurements
- There is an equal chance of being positive or negative
- E.g. Variation in the condition of measuring instruments/ inability of the observer to measure small intervals/ fluctuating external conditions/ irregularity of a quantity
- As positive and negative errors are equally error, we can take a number of repeated readings and find the average to reduce random errors
### Precision and accuracy in data readings
- Precision is how close the values are to each other, and is related to random error
- Accuracy is how close the values are to a true value, and is related to systematic error
## Uncertainties of derived quantities
### Addition and subtractions
$$\Delta R = \Delta R_1 + \Delta R_2 + ...$$
### Multiplication and division
$$\frac{\Delta R}{R} = \frac{\Delta R_1}{R_1}+ \frac{\Delta R_2}{R_2} + ...$$

>- When dividing by a whole number e.g. $P = \frac{Q}{N}$, where N is the whole number,
>	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P}= \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} + \frac{\Delta N}{N}$
>	- N is a number so $\Delta N = 0$
>	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P}= \frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- $\Delta P= P\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- Since $P = \frac{Q}{N}$, $\Delta P= \frac{Q}{N}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	- $\Delta P= \frac{Q}{N}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
>	-  $\Delta P= \frac{\Delta Q}{N}$
>When multiplying by a whole number, e.g. $P = QN$, where N is the whole number 
 >	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q} + \frac{\Delta N}{N}$
 >	- N is a number, so $\Delta N = 0$ 
 >	- $\frac{\Delta P}{P} = \frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- ${\Delta P} = {P}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- Since $P = QN$, ${\Delta P} = {QN}\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}$
 >	- ${\Delta P} = N \Delta Q$
### Others
- If $R=y^n$ then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = n\frac{\Delta y}{y}$
- If $R = p^m \times q^n$, then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = m\frac{\Delta p}{p}+ n\frac{\Delta q}{q}$
- If $R = \frac{p^m}{q^n}$, then $\frac{\Delta R}{R} = m\frac{\Delta p}{p}+ n\frac{\Delta q}{q}$
### Numerical substitution
- When the calculation is a mixture of both summation and multiplication of measurements, or involves non linear functions, we will just use numerical substitution $$Uncertainty = \frac{Maximum\ value\ of\ derived\ quanitity - Minimum\ value\ of derived quantity}{2}$$
