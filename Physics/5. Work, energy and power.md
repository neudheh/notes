## Work done by a constant force
- ==The work done by a constant force on an object is defined as the product of the component of the force along the direction of displacement, and the magnitude of displacement==$$W = (Fcos\theta)\Delta x$$
- $F$: Constant force applied, $\Delta x$: Displacement of the object, $\theta$: Angle between $F$ and $\Delta x$

- Work is a scalar quantity
- Si unit of joules ($J$)
## Work done by a variable force
- The work done by a variable force is the area under the force-displacement curve
## Work done by a gas
- Consider gas in a cylinder with a piston
![[Work done by a gas.png]]
- The piston is in equilibrium under the action of an external force $F$ acting to the left and a force $pA$ due to the pressure of the gas $p$ acting to the right
- Therefore, the force exerted by the gas is equal to $F = pA$
- Suppose that the gas expands slightly, pushing the piston outward slightly by a displacement $\Delta x$, which is so small $p$ remains practically constant
- The work done by he gas on the piston would be$$ W = (\rho A)(\Delta x) = \rho (\Delta V)$$
- $P$: Pressure of the gas, $A$: Surface area of the gas in contact with the piston , $\Delta x$: Distance moved by piston, $\Delta V$: Change in volume of the gas
- This is for constant external pressure
## Energy
- ==Energy is the capacity to do work==
- SI units of Joules ($J$)
- There are multiple types of energy
	1. Chemical
	2. Nuclear
	3. Radiant
	4. Electrical
	5. Internal (Potential/ Kinetic)
	6. Mechanical (Kinetic energy, Gravitational Potential Energy, Elastic Potential Energy)
### Kinetic energy
- The kinetic energy of an object is the energy it posses by virtue of its motion
### Deriving the equation for kinetic energy
![[Kinetic energy.png]]
- Consider an object of mass $m$ moving to the right under the action of a constant net force, $F_{net}$
- According to Newton's second law, $F=ma$, the object has a constant acceleration of $a$
- If the displacement of the object is $\Delta x$, the work done by the force is given by $$W_{net} = F_{net}\Delta x$$
- For constant acceleration, we can use the kinematics equation $v^2  =u^2 + 2as$, thus$$W_{net} = \frac{m(v^2- u^2)}{2} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$$
- If the object starts from rest (i.e. no initial velocity),$$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
### Gravitational potential energy
- Potential energy is the energy stored in a body or system as a result of its position, shape or state
- It is always associated with a system of 2 or more interacting objects
### Deriving the equation for gravitational potential energy
- Consider a book falling down to earth
- The change in the books height is $\Delta h$
- Ignoring air resistance, the only force acting on the book is gravitational force
- As $Weight = Mass \times Gravitational\ Field\ Strength$, $$W_g = mg(\Delta h)$$
- The work done by gravitational force is equal to the loss in GPE
- The work done against gravitational force is equal to the gain in GPE
- This equation is valid only near the earth's surface, where g is approximately constant
## Conservative and non-conservative forces
### Conservative forces
- A force is conservative if the work it does on an object moving between two points is independent of the path it takes
- In other words, the work done on an object by a conservative force depends only on the initial and final positions of the object
- The direction of the force does not depend on the path taken
![[Conservative force.png]]
- Gravitational force, elastic force, electrostatic force are conservative forces
- The work done by a conservative force is equal to the loss in the corresponding potential energy
- The work done against a conservative force is equal to the loss in the corresponding PE
- The work done by a conservative force does not change the total energy of the system (Kinetic energy + Potential energy)
### Non-conservative forces
- A force is non-conservative if the work it does on an object moving between two points is depended on the path it takes between its initial and final points
- The direction of the force changes based on the path taken
- Friction, drag, and propulsive forces are non-conservative forces
- If work is done by a non-conservative force, total energy of the system will increase
- If work is done against a non-conservative force, total energy of the system will decrease
### Conservative force and potential energy in a uniform field
- The gradient of a potential energy-position graph is equal to the magnitude of the force, but negative
![[gradient of potential energy graph is force.png]]
- In this case, the gravitational force is $-\frac{15.0 -3.0}{2.0} =-6.0N$
## Principle of conservation of energy
- ==The principle of conservation of energy states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can be transformed from one form to another==
- ==The total energy in a closed system is constant==
## Power
- Power is the rate of energy transfer/ work done
- SI unit of Watts ($W$)
- Instantaneous power: $P = \frac{dW}{dt}$
- $P$: Power, $W$: Work done, $t$:Time
- Average power: $P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$
- $P$: Power, $\Delta W$: Change in work done, $\Delta t$:time taken
- For a constant force $F$ moving at velocity $V$, if the force is in the direction of displacement,
	- Instantaneous power: $P = \frac{dW}{dt} =\frac{d(Fs)}{dt} =  F\frac{ds}{dt} = Fv$ (as $F$ is constant)
	- Average power: $P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = F \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = Fv$$$P = FV$$
	- $P$: Power, $F$: Force, $V$: Velocity
### Efficiency
$$Efficiency = \frac{Useful\ Power\ Output}{Total\ Power\ Input}$$
Over a period of time,
$$Efficiency = \frac{Useful\ Energy\ Output}{Total\ Energy\ Input}$$
