## Work done
- The work done by a constant force is the product of the component of the force along the direction of the displacement, and the magnitude of the displacement
  $$W=F\Delta x\cos\theta$$
- $W$: Work done ($J$), $F$: Force ($N$), $\Delta x$: displacement ($m$), $\theta$: Angle between $F$ and $\Delta x$ ($\degree$)

- Work is a scalar quantity
- SI unit of Joules ($J$)
### Variable forces
- The work done by a variable force can be found by the area under the force-displacement graph
### Work done by a gas
- Consider a gas enclosed in a cylinder of uniform cross-sectional area $A$ by a frictionless piston
- The piston is in equilibrium under the external action of a force $F$ on the left. and a force $pA$ due to the pressure of the gas
- Hence, $F=pA$
- The gas expands slightly pushing the piston outward by a displacement $\Delta x$ which is so small that $p$ remains practically constant
- The work done by the gas will be given by 
  $$W=pA(\Delta x) = p\Delta V$$
- $W$: Work done ($J$), $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$)
## Energy
- ==Energy is the capacity to do work==
- SI unit of Joules ($J$)
### Kinetic energy
- Kinetic energy of an object is the energy it posses due to its motion
- Consider a object of mass $m$ initially at rest moving to the right under the action of a net force $F$
- Because force is constant, Newton's second law says that the object moves with constant acceleration $a$
- If the object is displaced by a distance $\Delta x$, the work done by the force $F$ is 
  $W = F\Delta x \rightarrow W = ma\Delta x$
- For constant acceleration, we can use the equation $v^2=u^2+2as \rightarrow a\Delta x = \frac{v^2-u^2}{2}$
- Substituting, $W=m\frac{v^2-u^2}{2} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2-\frac{1}{2}mu^2$
- If the object starts from rest, then $$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- $E_K$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $m$: Mass of the object ($kg$), $v$: Speed of the object ($ms^{-1}$)
### Gravitational potential energy
- Potential energy is the energy store in a body or system as a result of its position, shape, or state
- Consider a object of mass $m$ falling
- Ignoring air resistance, the object falls a downward displacement $\Delta h$
- The only force acting on it is gravitational force $mg$
- Hence, the gravitational potential is given by $$E_p = mg\Delta h$$
- $E_P$: Gravitational potential energy ($J$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $g$: Gravitational field strength ($Nkg^{-1}$), $\Delta h$: Height ($m$)
- The equation is only valid for near the earth's surface where $g$ is approximately constant
## Conservative forces
- A force is conservative if the work it does on an object moving between two points is independent of the path the object takes
- I.e. The work dont on an object depends only on the initial and final positions of the object
- E.g. Gravitational, Elastic, Electrostatic forces
- Work done by a conservative force -> loss in the corresponding PE; Work done against a conservative force -> gain in the corresponding PE
- Work done by a conservative force does not change the total energy ($KE+PE$) of the system
### Nonconservative forces
- A force is nonconservative if the work it does on an object depends on the path taken by the object between its initial and final points
- E.g. Friction, Drag
- Work done by a non-conservative force -> total energy of the system will increase; Work done against a non-conservative force -> total energy of the system will decrease
### Potential energy in a uniform field
- For a uniform conservative force field, the negative of the gradient of a potential energy - position graph is equal to the  force $$F =-\frac{dU}{dx}$$
- $F$: Force ($N$), $U$: Potential energy ($J$), $x$: Position
## Conservation of energy
- ==The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy in a closes system is constant==
- ==Energy cannot be created or destroyed, it can only be transformed from one form to another, or transferred from one body to another, but the total amount is constant==
## Power
- ==Power is the rate of transfer of energy/ work done==
- SI units of Watts ($W$)
- Instantaneous power
  $$P=\frac{dW}{dt} = Fv$$
- Average power $$<P>=\frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = F<v>$$
- $P$: Power ($W$) , $W$: Work done ($J$), $t$: time ($s$), $F$: Force ($N$), $v$: velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
## Efficiency
$$Efficency = \frac{Useful\ power\ output}{Total\ power input}=\frac{Useful\ energy\ output}{Total\ energy\ input}$$
