## Work done
### Constant force
- ==The work done by a constant force on an object is the product of the component of the force that is along the direction of displacement, and the magnitude of displacement== $$W = (F \cos \theta) \Delta x $$
- Where $W$: Work done ($J$), $F$: Force ($F$), $\theta$: Angle between the direction of force and the direction of displacement ($\degree$), $\Delta x$: Displacement ($m$)
![[Work done by a constant force.png]]
- Work is a scalar quantity
- It has the SI unit of joule ($J$)
### Variable force
- The work done by a varying force will be different at every instant
- But, we can think of $F$ being constant over a very small displacement, $\Delta x$ such that the work done over the small displacement $\Delta x$ can be taken as $W = F\Delta x$ 
- The total work done by the force is equal to the area under the force-displacement curve
## Work done by a gas
![[Work done by a gas.png]]
- Gas is enclosed in a cylinder of uniform cross-sectional area $A$ by a frictionless piston
- The piston is in equilibrium under the external force $F$ acting to the left, and a force $pA$ due to the pressure $p$ of the gas acting to the right $$F = pA$$
- Suppose the gas expands slightly, pushing the piston out by a displacement $\Delta x$, which is so small that $p$ remains constant 
- The work done by the gas, under a constant external pressure, would be equal to $$W = pA \times\Delta x = p\Delta v$$
- Where $W$: Work done ($J$), $p$: Pressure ($N m^{-2}$), $A$: Area ($m^2$), $\Delta x$: Change in displacement, $\Delta v$: Change in volume ($m^3$)
## Energy
- Energy is the capacity to do work
- SI unit of Joules ($J$)
### Kinetic energy
![[Kinetic energy.png]]
- Consider an object of mass $m$ initially at rest moving to the right under the action of a constant net force $F_{net}$
- Because the force is constant, Newton's seconds law says that the object moves with constant acceleration $a$
- If the displacement of the object is $\Delta x$, the work done by the force is given by $$W_{net} = F_{net} \times \Delta x= (ma)\times \Delta x$$
- For constant acceleration, we can use the kinematics equation $v^2 = u^2 + 2as$ $$W_{net} = \frac{m (v^2 - u^2)}{2} = \frac{1}{2} mv^2 - \frac{1}{2} mu^2 $$
- If the object starts from rest, meaning it has no initial velocity,  $$KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
- Where $KE$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $m$: Mass of object ($kg$), $v$: Final velocity ($v$)
### Potential energy
- Potential energy is the energy stored in a body or system as a result of its position, shape, or state
### Gravitational potential energy
- Ignoring air resistance, a book of mass $m$ falls falls from an initial height $h_i$ to a final height $h_f$
- The downward displacement has a magnitude $\Delta h = h_f - h_i$
- The only force that does work on the book is gravitational force $mg$
- Hence, the work done by gravitational force is $$W = mg\Delta h$$
- Work done by gravitational force -> Loss in GPE, Work done against gravitational force -> Gain in GPE
- The equation for GPE only applies near the earth's surface, where $g$ is constant
- In solving problems involving GPE, you must choose a location to set $PE = 0$
- The choice of zero level is arbitrary, but the difference in PE between two points is not arbitrary
### Conservative and non-conservative forces
![[Conservative force.png]]
- ==Conservative force are forces where the work it does on an object is independent of the path it takes==
- The work done on an object by an conservative force depends only on the initial and final positions of the object
- E.g. Gravitational force, Elastic forces, Electrostatic force
- Work done by a conservative force -> Fall in corresponding PE, Work done against a conservative force -> Gain in corresponding PE
- Work done by a conservative force does not change the total energy ($KE + PE$) of a system
- Non-conservative forces are forces where the work done on an object depends on the path taken by the object between its initial and final points
- E.g. Friction, Drag
- If work is done by a non-conservative force, the total energy of the system will increase
- If work is done against a non-conservative force, the total energy of the system will decrease
- For a uniform conservative force field, the gradient of a potential energy-position graph is negative of the force on the object $$F = - \frac{dU(x)}{dx}$$
![[gradient of potential energy graph is force.png]]
- In this case, the gravitational force is $-\frac{15.0 -3.0}{2.0} =-6.0N$
## Conservation of energy
- ==The principle of conservation of energy states that the total energy in a closed system is constant==
- ==Energy cannot be created or destroyed in any process, it can only be transferred from one form to another, and one body to another, but the total amount remains constant==
- But, If non-conservative forces are present, total energy is not constant
## Power
- ==Power is the rate of transfer of energy==
- It is a scalar
- SI unit of watts ($W$)
- Instantaneous power $$P = \frac{dW}{dt}$$
- Average power $$\overline P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t}$$
- For a constant force $F$ acting on an object moving at velocity $v$, instantaneous power $$P = \frac{dW}{dt} = F \frac{ds}{dt} = Fv$$
- Average power $$\overline P = \frac{\Delta W}{\Delta t} = F\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t} = F \overline v$$
- Where $P$: Power ($W$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $t$: Time ($s$), $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
### Efficiency
$$Efficency = \frac{Useful\ power\ output}{Total\ power\ input} = \frac{Useful\ energy\ output}{Total\ energy\ input}$$
