## Rutherford's alpha particle scattering experiment
- Alpha particles (helium nuclei) can pass through a thin gold foil (3-4 atomic layers thick) with very little deflection
- Some of the alpha particles were scattered through very large angles, to the extent of being turned back on their original paths
![[scattering of alpha particles from gold foil.png]]
### Set-up
![[rutherford's alpha particle scattering experiment.png]]
- Alpha particles, emitted with energy of several millions of electron-volts from a radioactive source like plutonium, were used to bombard a very thin gold foil
- The scattered alpha particles were detected using a microscope and a fluorescent screen
- When the alpha particles strike the fluorescent screen, tiny flashes of light were observed using the microscope
- The microscope was rotates 360 decrees around the gold foil to observe the scattering of alpha particles through various angles
### Findings
- Forward and back-scattering occur because of the strong Coulomb repulsion of the alpha particles by the positively charged nucleus
- The fact that some of them turned back (back-tracking) indicated that there was a extremely small but heavy core of the nucleus, almost the mass of the atom
- The fact that most of the alpha particles either passed through the foil undisturbed or were scattered at small particles suggest that most of the atoms were just empty space

## Nucleus
- The nucleus is made up of two types of particles, protons and neutrons, collectively called nucleons
- The proton is 1836 times heavier than the mass of the electron, and it carries a single positive charge, equal in magnitude to that of the electron
- The neutron is uncharged and has a mass slightly larger than that of the proton
- The nucleus is thus overall positive, but the atoms is electrically neutral as there are as many negatively charged electrons as there are protons
### Representation of a nuclide
- The proton number is equal to the number of protons in the nucleus, therefore it is also equal to the number of electrons in a neutral atom
- The nucleon number is equal to the sum of the protons and neutrons in the nucleus
- A nuclide is the atom of a particular element whose proton and nucleon numbers are specified
$$^A_XZ$$
- $A$: Nucleon number, $X$: Proton number, $X$: Chemical symbol
### Isotopes
- Atoms with the same atomic number but different mass number are isotopes of each other
- They are chemically the same as they have the same number of valence electrons, but have different masses
### Nuclear mass and unified atomic mass unit
- The relative atomic mass is the ratio of the mass of the atom of the mass of one-twelfth of the mass of the carbon-12 atom
- The mass of the atom is also expressed in terms of the unified atomic mass unit $u$
$$1u=1.66\times10^{-27}kg$$
## Nuclear reactions
- Nuclear reactions is represented by an equations in which the total nucleon number and proton number balance on each side
$$^9_4Be+^4_2He\rightarrow ^{12}_6C+^1_0n$$
## Conservation laws
- **Nucleon number** - The sum of the mass numbers on both sides of the equation is the same
- **Proton number** - The sum of the atomic numbers on both sides of the equation is the same
- **Momentum** - The linear momentum of all the particles in the system is conserved
- **Mass-Energy** - Since mass and energy are interchangeable, the total-mass energy of the system remains constant
### Mass-energy equivalence
- Mass can be 'created' or 'destroyed', but when this happens, an equivalent amount of energy simultaneously vanishes or comes into being
  $$E=mc^2$$
- $E$: Energy ($J$), $m$: Mass ($Kg$), $c$: Speed of light ($3\times10^8ms^{-1}$)
- In every chemical reaction that involves energy, a certain amount of matter disappears, but the lost mass is a small fraction of the total mass of the reactants
- But, in nuclear reactions, the mass loss is significant, and a large amount of energy is created
- The mass of an isolated stationary object is called its rest mass
## Mass defect
- When a nucleus is separated into its individual components, the sum of the masses of its individual constituents (nucleons) is greater than the total mass of the nucleus
- This is known as mass defect
$$Mass\ defect\ \Delta m = Total\ rest\ mass\ of\ nucleons - rest\ mass\ of\ nucleus$$
### Binding energy
- Multiplying the mass defect by $c^2$ will give the amount of energy that must be delivered to the nucleus to break it up into its constituent protons and neutrons
- This is known as the binding energy of the nucleus
- ==The binding energy of the nucleus is defined as the energy released when the nucleus is first formed form its separate protons and neutrons==
- ==The binding energy of the nucleus is also defined as the work done on the nucleus to separate the nucleus into individual protons and neutrons==
- Binding energy per nucleon is the binding energy of the nucleus divided by the nucleon number or the mass number
### Nuclear stability
- The binding energy per nucleon is a measure of the stability of the nucleus; the higher the binding energy per nucleon, the more stable the nucleus
![[binding energy per nucleon.png]]
- Except for lighter nuclei, the average binding energy per nucleon is about 8MeV
- Binding energy per nucleon is maximum at iron-56, which is the most stable nuclide
- The greater the binding energy of the nucleon, the greater the energy needed to break up the nucleus
- Nuclei with low mass number may undergo fusion under certain conditions, so that the product may have a higher binding energy per nucleon
- Nuclei with high mass number may undergo fission, splitting up to give two daughter nuclei that have a higher binding energy per nucleon, with the release of neutrons
- If the energy absorbed by the reactants (binding energy per nucleon of reactants) is lesser than the energy released to form the products (binding energy per nucleon of products), there is a net release of energy
- The reaction is likely to happen
- If the energy absorbed by the reactants (binding energy per nucleon of reactants) is more than the energy released to form the products (binding energy per nucleon of products), there is a net absorption of energy
- The reaction is unlikely to happen
## Nuclear fission
- Nuclear fission is the disintegration of a heavy nucleus into two or more lighter nuclei when bombarded by a particle, usually a neutron, and releasing more neutrons
- This releases energy as the average binding energy per nucleon of the fission products is greater than that of the parent
- A nuclear chain reaction can occur if one fission reaction causes an average of one or more subsequent reactions, leading to a self-propagating series of reactions
- This will release several million times more energy than chemical reactions, leading to the invention of atomic fission weapons
- The energy is released in the form of kinetic energy of the fission fragments, and kinetic energy of neutrons and gamma radiation
## Nuclear fusion
- The binding energy per nucleon for light nuclei is much smaller than the binding energy for heavier nuclei
- Nuclear fusion is when two nuclei lowering in mass number combine to form a nucleus with a larger mass number, leading to the release of an enormous amount of energy
- Because the mass of the final nucleus is less than the sum of the masses of the original nuclei, there is a loss of mass accompanied by a release of energy
- As the part of the graph of the binding energy per nucleon against mass is steeper, a greater amount of energy per nucleon is released compared to fission
- But, fusion is a hard process to achieve due to the strong electrical repulsion between the nuclei when they are close to each other
- At extremely high temperates (100 million K), the nuclei have enough kinetic energy to overcome this repulsion, but the probability of fusion is small still
- The Sun's energy is a result of fusion converting hydrogen to helium
- On Earth, thermonuclear weapons use a small fission reaction to trigger a large fusion reaction
- Fusion is being researched as a possible substitute to fission nuclear reactors, as hydrogen is relatively available, and the raw materials to create fusion is cheaper
- But, the design of a sustainable, energy-positive fusion power plant has many challenges, as many designs are energy negative
- They take more energy to maintain the conditions required for fusion than the energy produced
## Radioactivity
- The positive and closely spaced protons have huge electrical forces of repulsion between them, but do not fly apart
- This is because they are bound to another by the strong nuclear force which is 100 times stronger than the coulomb repulsion between protons
- The force is a short-range force, acting over a limited range up to $10^{-15}m$
- For larger nuclei where protons are further apart, the attractive nuclear strong force may  be smaller than the repulsive force, hence they tend to be not as stable
- ==Radioactivity is the spontaneous and random disintegration of an unstable nucleus into a more stable nucleus through the emission of radiations such as alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays==
- Natural radioactivity is observed in unstable isotopes that exist in nature
- Artificial radioactivity is acquired by isotopes as a result of nuclear reactions
### Spontaneity and randomness
- Radioactive decays are spontaneous in that they occur on their own accord
- It is unaffected by physical factors (e.g. temperature, pressure) and chemical factors (e.g. in a compound/ mixture)
- Radioactive decays are random because it is impossible to predict which nucleus and exactly when a particular nucleus will disintegrate
- The particles are not emitted at regular intervals of time
- It is also impossible to know the direction of emission of particles
- But, statistically, it is possible to predict the fraction of nuclei that will decay over a period of time
### Geiger-Muller tube
- A Geiger-Muller tube is use to detect ionising radiation, containing gas at a low pressure and a inner wire at a high positive voltage
- When radiation enters the tube and ionises the gas inside, the wire attracts the free electrons, and a short pulse of current is detected
- This is amplified and counted by an electronic pulse counter, thus each time a particle/ ray enters the GM tube, a pulse is produced and counted
- It can also be connected to a loudspeaker which indicates the presence of particles with a series of clicks, or to a ratemeter measuring the rate of arrival in counts per second
- The random nature of decay is observed in the irregularity of the pulses from the pulse counter, the clicks from the counter, or the fluctuating count rate from the ratemeter
### Background radiation
- Nuclear radiation is all arounds us; rocks, soil, plants, and animals have small amounts of radioactive materials that are naturally present on earth
- Background count/ radiation is the radiation detected in a location with no radiation sources, from 20-50 counts per minute
- We will need to subtract the background count form the measurements taken if the emission rate form radioactive sources is low
## Nature of radiation
### Alpha particle
- When a nucleus disintegrates and emits an alpha particle, it undergoes alpha decay
- An alpha particle is identical to the helium nucleus, comprising of two protons and two neutrons bound together and is very stable
- Due to its large mass and double positive charge, it moves slowly and easily ionises atoms and molecules in their way, thus it has high ionising power
- As a result, they lose their energy quickly and cannot travel far, explaining its low penetrating power
- Their large mass means that they are not easily deflected by electric and magnetic field
- All alpha particles from a given type of nuclear reaction have the same kinetic energy
### Beta particle
- When a nucleus disintegrates and emits a beta particle, it undergoes beta decay
- An beta particle is a fast moving electron emitted from a nucleus, when a neutron is converted to a proton
- As they are small and fast-moving, they do not collide as often with other particles and have lesser ionising power
- As a result, they can travel further and have a higher penetrating power
- They are lighter than alpha particles, and are easily deflected by electric and magnetic fields
- The emitted electrons do not all have the same energy
### Gamma ray
- Nuclei in excited energy states give up their excess energy by emitting electromagnetic radiation
- An excited nucleus can return to its ground state by emitting a gamma ray photon
- As gamma rays have no charge, mass and travel at the speed of light, they have very little ionisation and can travel very far
- They cannot be deflected by electric and magnetic fields and have the greatest penetrating power

## Nuclear equations
### Alpha particle
$$^A_ZX\rightarrow^4_2He+^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y$$
- $^A_ZX$: Parent nuclide, $^4_2He$: Alpha particle, $^{A-4}_{Z-2}Y$: Daughter nuclide
### Beta particle
- Conservation of energy suggests the existence of a third particle (neutrino or antineutrino) as the emitted positive or electrons do not have the same kinetic energy
- Conservation of momentum also suggests the existence of neutrinos and antineutrinos when the moment of all the nuclides and particles are taken into account
- Neutrinos and antineutrinos are subatomic particles that have no electrical charge and a mass that is close to zero
- They have very little interaction with matter and hard to detect
$$^A_ZX\rightarrow^0_{-1}e+^A_{Z+1}Y+\bar{V_e}$$
- $^A_ZX$: Parent nuclide, $^0_{-1}e$: Beta particle, $^A_{Z+1}Y$: Daughter nuclide, $\bar{V_e}$: neutrino
### Gamma rays
- The composition of the nucleus is not altered as energy is released in the form of a photon
## Decay laws
### Activity
- ==The activity of a radioactive material is the number of disintegration of its atoms per unit time==
$$A=-\frac{dN}{dt}$$
- $A$: Activity ($Bq$), $N$: Number of atoms, $t$: time ($s$)
- 1 becquerel ($Bq$) = 1 disintegration per second
- The activity or rate of decay is proportional to the number of atoms available for decay $$A=\lambda N$$
- $A$: Activity ($Bq$), $\lambda$: Decay constant ($s^{-1}$), $N$: Number of atoms
- The number of undecayed radioactive atoms decreases exponentially with time
$$N=N_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
- As mass, activity and count rate are proportional to the number of atoms, $$A=A_0e^{-\lambda t},\ m = m_0e^{-\lambda t},\ C=C_0e^{-\lambda t}$$
- - $N$: Number of atoms, $\lambda$: Decay constant ($s^{-1}$), $t$: time ($s$), $A$: Activity ($Bq$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $C$: Count rate ($s^{-1}$)
### Half life
- ==The half-life is the time taken for half the number of nuclei of a radioactive element to decay==
- The half-lives for radioactive elements are constant, as the rates of decay are not affected by external conditions (e.g. temperature, pressure, compound)
$$t_{1/2}=\frac{\ln 2}{\lambda}$$
- $t_{1/2}$: half-life ($s$), $\lambda$: Decay constant ($s^{-1}$)
### Decay constant
$$\lambda=\frac{Number\ of\ particles\ emitted\ per\ unit\ time}{Number\ of\ particles\ in\ the\ source}$$
- The decay constant is also the probability of a particular atom decaying per unit time

## Biological effects
- Radiation damage in biological organisms is due to the ionisation effects in cells
- The normal function of cells may be disrupted as a result of the ionising radiation
- Cells may become defective, leading to cancer or damaged reproductive genes
- Immediate effects of over-exposure include blistering of the skin, nausea, vomiting, radiation sickness, loss of heath, emaciation, and death
- Long-term effects include anaemia, leukaemia, cancer, sterility, and genetic mutation
## Safety precautions
- Store radioactive material in lead containers when not in use
- Handle samples by remote control or at a safe distance
- Shielding from equipment producing or scattering radiation
- Wear radiation badges which records the radioactive exposure by using the blackening of a photographic film or emulsion
- Handle radioactive substances with tongs, at a distance, and pointing away form your body and others
- Wear rubber gloves
- Do not allow them to enter the body
