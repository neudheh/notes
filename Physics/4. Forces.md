- ==A force is a push or a pull==
- ==It is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment
- It is a vector quantity, with magnitude and direction
- Its SI unit is the newton ($N$)
- One newton is the amount of force to give a 1 $kg$ mass an acceleration of 1 $ms^{-2}$
## Types of forces
- Contact forces are forces that involve direct contact between two bodies
- Non-contact forces are forces that act, even when the bodies are separated by empty space
- They act through a field, which is the region of space in which a force acts
- The type of force determines what is influenced in the field (e.g. electric charges are influenced in an electric field)
### Gravitational force
- Gravitation force is due to interactions between masses
- Gravitational force acting on an object is called weight if it is due to the gravity of the earth
- A mass experiences a force in a gravitational field
### Magnetic force
- Magnetic force is due to interaction between two magnets
- Moving charges and current-carrying conductors also experience a magnetic force in a magnetic field
- The direction of magnetic force can be found using Fleming's left-hand rule
### Electric force
- Electrostatic force is due to the interaction between charges
- A charge will experience an electric force in an electric field
### Applied force
- An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or another object
- If a person is pulling a box across the room, there is an applied force acting on the box
### Normal force
- ==The normal force is the support force exerted on an object that is in contact with another object==
- The force always acts perpendicular and pointing away to the surface of contact, no matter the angle of the surface
### Friction
- ==Friction is a force between two surfaces that are sliding or trying to slide across each other==
- It opposes the motion of an object when the surface of one object comes into contact with another
- It is caused by irregularities in the surfaces that are in mutual contact and depends on the surfaces in contact, as well as how much they are pressed against each other
- For smooth surfaces, we can ignore friction
- Friction when two surfaces are not sliding across each other is known as static friction
- Static friction prevents the object from moving
- Friction is proportional to normal force
- A 10 $kg$ object resting on a table will have a larger static friction compared to a 10 $g$ object placed on the same table
- Friction can also not oppose the direction of motion, such as walking or turning a car
### Drag or viscous force
- ==Drag or viscous force is a type of friction that occurs when there is relative motion between an object and a fluid like air or water==
- Viscosity refers to the degree of internal friction in a liquid
- Objects moving in viscous fluids will experience a greater viscous force than in water, assuming all other conditions remain the same
- When the fluid is air, drag is also known as air resistance
- When the fluid is liquid it is known as viscous force
### Tension and compression
- Tension force is one that pulls materials apart, causing the body to be stretched/ tensioned
- Compression force is one that squeezes material together, causing the body to be compressed
## Hooke's law
- Hooke's law states that the deformation of an elastic object is proportional to the applied force, provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded $$F = kx$$
- Where $F$: External force ($N$), $k$: Force constant ($N m ^{-1}$),  $x$: deformation ($m$)
- The spring constant $k$ is a measure of the stiffness of the elastic object
### Elastic potential energy
- Work is done when a force is applied to deform (stretch/ compress an elastic material)
- The work done is stored as elastic potential energy in a deformed object
- The energy is stored until the force is removed and the object springs back to its original shape
- The area under a force-displacement graph gives the work done by the force, thus the elastic potential energy can be found from under the area of the force-extension graph $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}Fx$$
- Where $EPE$: Elastic potential energy ($J$), $F$: Force ($N$), $x$: Deformation ($m$)
- Using $F=kx$, we can get other forms $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{F^2}{2k}$$
- Where $EPE$: Elastic potential energy ($J$), $F$: External force ($N$), $k$: Force constant ($N m ^{-1}$),  $x$: deformation ($m$)
- For a spring that is already stretched to $x_1$, the additional work done in stretching it to $x_2$ is given by $$W = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2^2 + x_1^2)$$
- Where $W$: Elastic potential energy ($J$), $k$: Force constant ($N m ^{-1}$),  $x$: deformation ($m$)
- When an increasing force is applied to an elastic object, it may deform beyond its limit of proportionality
- When this happens, the force-extension curve will follow a different path
- But, elastic potential energy can always be found under the force-extension curve, regardless of shape
### Combination of springs
#### Series
- A force is applied to the end of combined springs
- All springs experience the same force $F$
- If the extension of the springs are $x_1$ and $x_2$, the total effective extension $x_{eff}$ is given by $$x_{eff} = x_1 + x_2$$
- Using $F = kx$, $x = \frac{F}{k}$ $$\frac{F}{k_eff}= \frac{F}{k_1} + \frac{F}{k_2}$$$$\frac{1}{k_eff}= \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}$$
#### Parallel
- A force is applied to the end of the combined spring
- All of the springs will have the same extension $x$
- If the force experienced by the two springs are $F_1$ and $F_2$, then $$F = F_1 + F_2$$ $$k_{eff}x = k_1x + k_2x$$$$k_{eff} = k_1 + k_2$$
## Upthrust
- ==Upthrust is an upward force that an object that is partly or completely submerged experiences==
- A object that is partly or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on its bottom surface than on its top surface
- Upthrust is due to a greater pressure on the bottom surface than on the top
![[Upthrust.png]]
$$Upthrust\ U = F_{Bottom} - F_{Top}$$
$$=P_2A - P_1A$$
$$=[(P_0 + \rho gh_2) - (P_0 + \rho g h_1)]A $$
$$=(\rho gh_2-\rho gh_1)A$$
$$=(h_2 - h_1)A\rho g$$
$$= HA\rho g$$
$$U = V\rho g$$
- Where $P_0$: Atmospheric pressure ($F m^{-2}$), $V$: Volume of the solid ($m^3$), $\rho$: Density of fluid ($kg\ m^{-3}$),  $g$: gravitational field strength ($N\ kg^{-1}$)
### Archimedes's principle
- ==Archimedes' principle states that when an object is partially or totally immersed in a fluid, the upthrust is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight of the fluid displaced==
- Upthrust = Weight of fluid displaced
### Principle of floatation
- ==Principle of floatation states that when an object floats on a fluid such as water, the upthrust that acts on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to its weight==
- Upthrust = Weight of the object
## Centre of gravity
- ==The centre of gravity of a body is the point where the entire weight of the body acts or appears to act==
- The weight does not act at a single point, it is distributed over the entire body
- But, we can assume the entire force of gravity (weight) is concentrated at a point called the centre of gravity
- We can often use symmetry considerations to locate the centre of gravity of a body
- The centre of gravity of a sphere, cube, circle, or rectangle is at its geometric centre
### Experiment to find the centre of gravity
- We can find the centre of gravity using a plumb line and a support
- Since the weight of an object is concentrated at the centre of gravity, the force of gravity passes through this point in a vertical line towards the earth
- An object hanging at any point will automatically rotate so that the centre of gravity is along this vertical line from the vertical point
- Hanging the shape at any point will cause the shape to rotate until its centre of gravity lines up directly below the hanging point
- Drawing a line along the plumb line allows us to see the vertical line between the hanging point and the center of the earth
- But, one line is not enough to pinpoint the exact centre of gravity, it could be anywhere along this line
- Thus, we hang the shape at a different point and draw another line along the plumb line

## Turning effects of forces
- ==The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the axis ==$$M = F \times r$$
- Where $M$: Moment ($N m$), $F$: Force ($N$), $r$: perpendicular distance from the line of action to the axis ($m$)
- If the force is not perpendicular, we can resolve the force, or the distance to the axis
### Couples
- A couple is two parallel force that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and do not meet
- The resultant force of a couple is zero, but resultant torque is not zero
- Torque of a couple is the product of one force and the perpendicular distance between the forces $$\tau = F \times d_{\perp}$$
- Where $\tau$: Tourque ($Nm$), $F$: Force ($N$), $d_{\perp}$: Perpendicular distance between the two forces ($m$) 
## Equilibrium
- An object is in equilibrium if it is in translational and rotational equilibrium
- ==Translational equilibrium is when there is no resultant force on the system in any direction==
- Rotational equilibrium is known as the principle of moments
- ==The principle of moments states that for a system in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any axis is equal to the sum of the anti-clockwise moments about the same axis==
### Two forces
- Two forces acting on an object, $T$ and $W$
- Translational equilibrium: $T = W$
- Rotational equilibrium: The lines of action of both $T$ and $W$ must coincide
### Three forces
- A closed triangle can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows of the forces follow each other around the triangle (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
- The lines of action of the three forces must pass through a common point in a free body diagram
### More than three forces
- A closed polygon can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows of the forces follow each other around the polygon (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
