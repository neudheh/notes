## Forces
- ==A force is a push or a pull==
- ==It is an interaction between two objects or an object and its environment==
- It is a vector quantity
- SI units of Newton ($N$)
- One newton is the amount of force to give a 1 kg mass an acceleration of 1 $ms^{-2}$
- Hence, $1N = 1ms^{-2}$ 
## Types of forces
- Contact forces are forces that involve direct contact between two bodies
- E.g. Applied force, normal force, friction, drag/ viscous force, tension and compression, upthrust/ buoyant force
- Non-contact forces are forces that can act even when the objects are separated by empty space
- E.g. gravitational force, magnetic force, electric force
- Non-contact forces act through a ==field, which is a region of space in which a force acts==
- The type of force determines what is influence by the force in the field (e.g. electric charges are influence in a electric field)
### Gravitational force
- Gravitational force is due to the interaction between masses
- Gravitational force acting on an object is called weight if it due to the gravity of the earth
- A mass experiences a force in a gravitational field
### Magnetic force
- Magnetic force is due to interaction between two magnets/ magnet and magnetic materials
- Moving charges and current-carrying conductors also experience magnetic force in a magnetic field
- The direction of magnetic force can be found suing Fleming's left-hand rule
### Electric force
- Electrostatic force is due to interaction between charges
- A charge will experience an electric force in an electric field
### Applied force
- An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or another object
### Normal force
- ==The normal force is the support force exerted on an object when it is in contact with another object==
- The force is perpendicular to the surface of contact, and pointing away from the object
### Friction
- ==Friction is a force that resists motion when the surface of an object comes into contact with another==
- Friction is the force that opposes motion of an object
- Friction is cause by irregularities in the surfaces in mutual contact
- For a smooth surface, we can ignore friction
- Friction depends on the surfaces in contact and how much they are pressed against each other
- Friction that exists when two surfaces are not sliding across one another is known as static friction
- Static friction prevents object from motion
- Friction is proportional to normal force
- A 10 kg object will experience more friction than a 10 g object on the same surface
- Friction sometimes does not opposed the direction of motion (e.g a car turning, a person walking)
### Drag/ viscous force
- ==Drag or viscous force is another kind of friction when there is relative motion between an object and a fluid such as air or water==
- Viscosity is the degree of internal friction in a fluid
- Objects moving in highly viscous fluids will experience a greater viscous force than in less viscous fluids
- In air, drag is known as air resistance
- In liquid, drag is known as viscous force
### Tension and compression
- A tension force is one that pulls materials apart, causing the body to be stretched/ tensioned
- A compression force is one that squeezes material together, causing the body to be compressed
## Hooke's law
- Hooke's law states that the deformation $x$ of an elastic object is proportional to the applied force $F$, provided that the limit of proportionality is not exceeded$$F = kx$$
- $F$: Force, $k$: force constant ($Nm^{-1}$), $x$: deformation
- The deformation how much the spring has stretched is when the spring is not moving
- The spring constant $k$ is a measure of the stiffness of the elastic object
### Elastic potential energy
- Work is done when a force is applied to deform an elastic material
- This work done is stored as elastic potential energy in the deformed object until the force is removed and the object springs back into its original shape
- The elastic potential energy is the area under the force-deformation graph$$EPE = \frac{1}{2}Fx$$
- $EPE$: Elastic potential energy, $F$: Force, $x$ Deformation
- Using $F = kx$, $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{F^2}{2k}$$
- $EPE$: Elastic potential energy, $F$: Force, $k$: force constant ($Nm^{-1}$), $x$: deformation
- The extra work done to stretch a spring from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is given by$$EPE = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2\ ^2 + x_1\ ^2)$$
- $EPE$: Elastic potential energy, $k$: force constant ($Nm^{-1}$), $x$: deformation
### Series combination of springs
- For a spring in series, the force $F$ exerted on all of the springs is the same and $x_{eff} = x_1 + x_2 +...$
- From Hooke's law,$$\frac{F}{k_{eff}} = \frac{F}{k_1} + {F}{k_2}+...+\frac{F}{k_n}$$
- Since $F$ is the same,$$\frac{1}{k_{eff}} =\frac{1}{k_1}+ \frac{1}{k_2}+...+\frac{1}{k_n}$$
### Parallel combination of springs
- For a spring in parallel, the deformation $x$ of the spring is the same, and $F_{eff} = F_1 + F_2+...$
- From Hooke's law,$$k_{eff}x = k_1x + k_2x + ... + k_nx$$
- Since $x$ is the same,$$k_{eff} = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_n$$
## Upthrust/Buoyancy force
- An object that is partly or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on its bottom than on the top surface, resulting in upthrust
- Upthrust is an upward force that acts on an object that is partly or completely submerged due to differences in pressure on the bottom surface on the object than on the top surface
- Since $P = h\rho g$, where $P$: Pressure, $h$: Depth, $g$: Density of fluid, $g$: gravitational field strength, pressure increases as you go deeper in a fluid
### Deriving
- Upthrust $U = F_{bottom} - F_{top}$
$=P_2A -  P_1A$
$= [(P_0 +h_2\rho g) - (P_0 + h_1\rho g)]A$
$=(h_2 - h_1)A\rho g$
$=HA\rho g$
$= V\rho g$
- $P_0$: Atmospheric pressure, $V = HA$: Volume of solid, $\rho$: Density of fluid

### Archimedes' principle
- ==Archimedes' principle states that when an object is partially or totally immersed in a fluid, the upthrust on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the fluid displaced==
### Principle of flotation
- ==The principle of flotation states that when an object floats on a fluid, the upthrust that acts on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object==
- An object is floating if it is not supported by anything but the liquid
## Center of gravity
- ==The center of gravity of a body is the point at which the entire weight of the body acts or appears to act==
- The weight does not act at a single point it is distributed over the entire body
- But we can assume that the entire force of gravity (weight) is concentrated at a point called the center of gravity
- For symmetric bodies, the center of gravity is at its geometric center
- The center of gravity can lie outside of a body
### Experiment to determine the center of gravity
- For a body with more complex shape, we can locate the center of gravity using a support and plumb line
![[centre of gravity of lamina.png]]
- Since the weight of the object is concentrated in the center of gravity, the force of gravity passes through this point in a vertical line towards the earth
- An object hanging from any point will automatically rotate so that its center of gravity is along this line from the hanging point
- Thus, hanging the shape at any point will cause the shape to rotate until the center of gravity lines up directly below the hanging point
- Drawing a line along the plumb line enables us to see the vertical line between the hanging point and the center of gravity
- But one line is not enough to pinpoint the center as it could be anywhere along the line
- Hence, we hang the shape at different points and draw another line along the plumb line
## Turning effects of forces
- ==The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force and perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the axis==$$M = F \times r$$
- $M$: Moment, $F$: Force, $r$: perpendicular distance
- SI unit of Newton meters ($Nm$)
- If the force is not perpendicular to the axis, the can resolve the force or find the perpendicular distance
### Couples
- ==A couple consts of two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and do not meet==
- The resultant force of a couple is zero, the the resultant torque is not zero
- The torque of a couple is the product of one force $F$, and the perpendicular distance between the forces$$\tau = F \times d$$
- $\tau$ = Torque, F = Force, d = perpendicular distance
## Equilibrium
- ==An object is in equilibrium if it is in translational equilibrium and rotational equilibrium==
- ==Translational equilibrium is when there is no resultant force about the system in any direction==
- Rotational equilibrium is also known as the principle of moments
- ==The principle of moments states that for a system in equilibrium, the sum of anti-clockwise moments about any axis is equal to the sum of clockwise moments about the same axis==
### Two forces
- Two forces acting on an object, $T$ and $W$
- Translational equilibrium: $T = W$
- Rotational equilibrium: The lines of action of both $T$ and $W$ must coincide
### Three forces
- A closed triangle can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows of the forces follow each other around the triangle (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
- The lines of action of the three forces must pass through a common point in a free body diagram
### More than three forces
- A closed polygon can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows of the forces follow each other around the polygon (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
