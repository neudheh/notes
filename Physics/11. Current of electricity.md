## Current
- ==Current is the rate of flow of electric charge through a given cross section of a conductor==
$$I = \frac{Q}{T}$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $Q$ = Charge ($C$), $T$ = Time ($s$)
- In conductors, current is due tho the flow of negative charges called electrons
- In semiconductors, current is due to both positive (holes) and negative charges
- In ionised gasses and electrolytes, the charge carriers are the positive and negative ions
### Conventional current
- Conventional current in a current is taken to be the flow of positive charges
- For example, in metals, the positive charges (the ion cores) do not move, and the charge carriers are only negative
- Hence, current direction is opposite to the direction of flow of the negative charges
- The flow of positive and negative charges add up
## Charge
- ==The charge which flows a past a given cross section is the product of the steady current which flows past the section and the time during which the current flows==
$$Q = It$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $Q$ = Charge ($C$), $T$ = Time ($s$)
- One coloumb is the amount of electrical charge that passes through a given cross section of a circuit when a steady current of one ampere flows in one second
### Number density
- Consider charges drifting through a short section $\Delta x$ of a conductor of cross sectional area $A$
- The volume is $V = A\Delta x$
- The number of charge carries in this section is given by $N = nA\Delta x$, where $n$ is charge density
- The total charge is $Q = q(nA\Delta x)$, where q is the charge of one particle
- The average current is $I = \frac{q(nA\Delta x)}{\Delta t}$, where $\Delta t$ is the time taken to travel a distance equal to $\Delta x$
- Since the drift speed of electrons $V_d$ is equal to $\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, $$I = nAV_dq$$
- Where  $I$ = Current ($A$), $n$= charge density ($m^{-3}$),  $A$ = cross sectional area ($m^2$), $V_d$ = Drift speed ($ms^{-1}$), q = Charge ($C$)
## Mechanism of electrical conduction
### Metals
- In metals, there are many free electrons which are free to move throughout the atomic network
- Due to the thermal energy that these free electrons posses, they move freely and randomly inside the metal
- Their direction of travel may change due to collisions with one another and atoms in the metal lattice
- Their motion is haphazard (as in that of gas molecules)
- Thus, there is no net flow of charge, and there is no electric current
![[free electrons in metals.png]]
- But, when an external electric field that is applied to the metal, there will be an electric force acting on the  electrons
- The electrons drift to the opposite to the direction of the electric field E, while steel keeping their random motion
- Hence, there is a net motion of electrons opposite to the directions of the electric field
- The speed at which the electrons gradually flow is known as the drift speed
- This net flow of electrons makes up an electric current
![[electrons in metal conducting electricity.png]]
### Semiconductors
- Semiconductors have four electrons in the outermost shell (4 valence electrons) 
- Neighbouring atoms are bonded together through covalent bonds, where the outer valence electrons are shared
- At room temperature, a valence electron may have sufficient energy to leave an atom, and become a free electron
- This leaves a vacancy known as a hole, which has a net positive charge
- In a pure semiconductor, the number of free electrons is equal to the number of positive holes
- When a potential difference is applied across a piece of semiconductor, the electrons drift in one direction
- Some of the positive holes may be filled up by the drifting electrons or valence atoms
- When a valence electron from another atom fills a hole, the hole is transferred
- Hence, there is a net flow of charge due to a drift in electrons in one direction and the transferring of positive holes in another direction
## Potential difference
- For current to flow, there must be a electric potential difference
- Current flows from a high potential to a low potential 
- ==Potential difference between two points in a circuit is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy per unit charge passing from one point to the other==
$$V = \frac{W}{Q} = \frac{P}{I} \rightarrow P = IV$$
- Where $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), $W$ = Work done ($J$), $Q$ = Charge ($C$), $P$ = Power ($W$), $I$ = Current ($A$)
- The volt is the potential difference across two points in a circuit if one joule of electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy is done per coulomb of charge from one point to the other
## Electromotive force (e.m.f)
- ==The electromotive force (e.m.f) of any source of electrical energy is the total energy converted into electrical energy per unit charge supplied==
$$E = \frac{W}{Q}$$
- Where $E$ = e.m.f ($V$), $W$ = Work done ($J$), $Q$ = Charge ($C$)
- Batteries convert chemical energy to electrical energy
- Generators convert mechanical energy to electrical energy
- E.m.f. is the energy converted from non-electrical energy to electrical energy per unit charge supplied
- Potential difference is the energy converted from electrical energy to non-electrical energy per unit charge passing through from one point to the other
### The kilowatt-hour
- The kilowatt hour is a unit for energy that is used to calculate electrical energy consumption in households and in commercial premises
$$1kWh = 1kW \times 1hr$$
$$1 kWh = (1000 W) \times (3600)s$$
$$1 kWh = 3.6 \times 10^6 J$$

## Resistance
- ==Resistance of a conductor is the ratio of potential difference across the conductor to the current flowing through it==
$$R = \frac{V}{I} \rightarrow V = RI$$
-  Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
- 1 ohm is the resistance of a conductor such that one ampere of current flows through it per volt of pd applied across it
- It is not the gradient of a V-I graph, rather it is the gradient of a straight line passing through the origin at that point
## Ohm's law
- ==Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the p.d. across it, provided temperature and other physical conditions are constant==
$$I \propto V$$
-  Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), 
### Ohmic conductors
- Ohmic conductors are conductors that obey ohms law
- Their I-V graph will give a straight line through the origin
- Their resistance is constant
![[ohmic conductors.png]]
- For non-ohmic conductors, their I-V characteristics are not straight lines passing through the origin
### Filament lamp
- For a filament lamp, the number of charge carriers does not change by much
- Resistance increases as temperature increases
- This is because when the current flowing thorough the conductor increases, as a result of joule heating, the temperature will rise
- The amplitude of atom's vibrations increases, causing the free electrons to collide more frequently with the atoms, increasing obstruction
- This causes the resistance of the non-ohmic conductor to rise
- Through this, we can deduce that the filament is metal
### Thermistor
- Thermistors are semiconductors whose resistance is sensitive to temperature
- For a negative temperature coefficient (NTC) thermistor,
	- The number of charge carries increases with with temperature
	- R decreases greatly as temperature increases
![[thermistor i-v graph.png]]
- This is the graph for an NTC thermistor
![[ntc thermistor.png]]
>[!NOTE]
>- The graph of an **N**TC thermistor looks like the **N**ike swoosh
>- The graph of a **P**TC thermistor looks like the **P**uma logo
### Semiconductor diode
- It is a diode made up of two different semiconductors, which conducts well for one direction of current but not the other
- It offers low resistance in one direction, but much higher resistance in the other
![[semi conductor diode.png]]
## Resistivity
- ==Resistivity is a property of the material, independent of the shape and size of the conductor==
- Two wires of the same length and cross sectional area may not conduct as equally well as they have different resistivities
$$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$
- Where $R$ = Resistance ($\Omega$), $\rho$ = Resistivity ($\omega m$), $l$ = Length ($m$), A = Cross sectional area ($m^2$)
## Internal resistance
- The e.m.f. of a cell can be measured by using a voltmeter across the terminals of the cell, with the switch S open
![[internal resistance set up.png]]
- The voltmeter gives an approximate value of the e.m.f. of the cell
- When S is closed, the voltmeter is connected to the external resistor, causing the reading of the voltmeter to be lower than that of the initial reading
- This means there is a loss in voltage, due to voltage being used to drive the current in the cell
- Thus there is internal resistance in the cell due to resistance of chemicals in the cell
$$E - Ir = V$$
- Where $E$ = e.m.f. ($V$), $I$ =current ($A$), r = Internal resistance ($\Omega$), $V$ = Terminal p.d. ($V$)
### Maximum power theorem
- When there is no internal resistance, the power delivered to external load of fixed resistance $R$ is constant
- But to find the maximum power delivered for a circuit with internal resistance, we need to vary $R$
![[maximum 200 power therom.png]]
$$E = I(R + r) \rightarrow I = \frac{E}{R+r}$$
$$P = IV = I^2R = (\frac{E}{R+r})^2R$$
- For maximum power dissipated, $\frac{dP}{dR}$ =0
$$\frac{dP}{dR} = E^2[\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}-\frac{2R(r+R)}{(R+r)^4}] =0$$
$$(R+r)^2 - 2R(r+R) = 0$$
$$R + r -2R =0$$
$$R = r$$
- Where $R$ = Total effective resistance of circuit ($\Omega$), $r$ = Internal resistance ($\ohm$)
- But, efficiency is only 50%, as half of the electrical energy is lost due to internal resistance
