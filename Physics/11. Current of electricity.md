## Current
- ==Current is the rate of flow of charge through a given cross section of a conductor==
  $$I=\frac{Q}{t}$$
- $I$: Current ($A$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $t$: Time ($s$)
- In metals, current is due to the flow of negative charges called electrons
- In semiconductors (materials from the group IV of the period table), current can be due to positive holes and negative charges
- In ionised gasses and electrolytes, the charge carriers are the positive and negative ions
- Conventional current is in the direction of the flow of positive charge, opposite to the direction of flow of the negative charges
### Charge
- ==Charge which flows past a given cross section is the product of the steady current that flows past a section and the time during which the current flows==
- 1 Coulomb is the amount of electrical charge that passes through a given cross section of a circuit when a steady current of 1A flows in 1 second
### Number density
- Consider charges drifting through a short section $\Delta x$ of a conductor of cross-sectional area $A$
- Volume $V=A\Delta x$
- Number of charge carriers $N=n\Delta v=nA\Delta x$
- Total charge $Q=(nA\Delta x)q$
- Average current $I=\frac{(nA\Delta x)}{\Delta t}q$
- Since, $v=\frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, 
  $$I=naVq$$
- $I$: Current ($A$), $n$: Charge density ($m^{-3}$), $V$: Drift speed ($ms^{-2}$), $q$: Charge ($C$)
## Mechanism of electrical conduction
### Metals
- Metals have many free electrons which are free to move throughout the atomic network
- Due to thermal energy that the electrons posses, they move freely and randomly inside the metal
- Their directions of travel may change due to collisions with one another, and atoms in the metal lattice
- Their motion is haphazard
![[free electrons in metals.png]]
- Hence, there is no net flow of charge and there is no current
- When an external electric field is applied to a metal, there will be an electrical force acting on the electrons
- The electrons drift opposite to the direction the direction of the electric field while still keeping their random motion
![[electrons in metal conducting electricity.png]]
- Thus, the result is the net motion of the electrons opposite to the direction of the electric field
- The net flow of electrons make up an electric current
### Semiconductors
- E.g. Carbon, sillicon, geranium
- These substances have 4 valence electron, and atoms are bonded together through covalent bonds where the outer valence electrons are shared
- At room temperature, a valence electron may have enough energy to leave and atom, and become a free electron
- This leaves a vacancy known as a hole which has a net positive charge
- The number of free electrons is equal to the number of positive holes
- When a potential difference is applies across a semiconductor, the free electrons drift in one direction
- Some of the positive holes may be filled up by the drifting electrons or valence electron, and when a valence electron from another atom fills a hole, the hole is transferred
- There is a drift of free electrons in one direction and positive holes in the opposite direction
## Potential difference
- For current to flow from an area of higher potential to that of a lower potential, there must be a potential difference
- ==Potential difference between two points in a circuit is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy per unit charge passing from one point to another==
  $$V=\frac{W}{Q}=\frac{P}{I}$$
  - $V$: Voltage ($V$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $P$: Power ($W$), $I$: Current ($A$)
  - 1V is the potential difference between two points in a circuit if 1J of electrical energy is converted to other forms per Coloumb of charge passing from one point to another
### Electromotive force
- ==Electromotive force is the work done by a source of e.m.f. is the total energy converted into electrical energy per unit charge supplied==
  $$E=\frac{W}{Q}=\frac{P}{I}$$
- $E$: E.m.f. ($V$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $P$: Power ($W$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- E.m.f is the energy converted from non-electrical to electrical per unit charge delivered by the e.m.f. source
- P.d. is the energy converted from electrical to non-electrical per unit charge passing through two points
### Kilowatt-hour
- The kilowatt hour is a unit of energy ($1000W\times3600s=3.6\times10^6J$)
## Resistance
- ==Resistance of a conductor is the ratio of potential difference across a conductor to the current flowing through it==
  $$R=\frac{V}{I}$$
- $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$), $V$: Voltage ($V$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- One ohm is the resistance of a conductor such that a current of 1A flows per volt of p.d. applied across it
- Resistance is not the gradient of an I-V graph, but rather the gradient of the line passing though the origin that touches that point
### Ohm's law
- ==Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the p.d. across it, provided temperature and other physical conditions are constant==
### Ohmic conductors
- Ohmic conductors obey Ohm's law
- Their I-V graph is a straight line passing through the origin as resistance is constant
![[ohmic conductors.png]]
- Non-ohmic conductors have I-V graphs that are not straight lines passing through the origin
- When current is passed through the conductor, due to joule heating, the temperature will rise
- The amplitude of the atom's vibrations increases, and the free electrons collide more frequently with the atoms and experience more obstruction, increasing resistance
### Filament lamp
- Resistance increases due to increased collisions of charge carriers with vibrating atoms (since the filament is metal)
- The number of charge carriers does not change much
![[filament lamp.png]]
### Thermistor
- Thermistors are semiconductors whose resistance is sensitive to temperature
- For a negative temperature coefficient thermistor, number of charge carriers increases with an increase in temperature
- Thus, resistance decreases greatly as temperature increases
![[thermistor i-v graph.png]]
![[ntc thermistor.png]]
### Semiconductor diode
- Semiconductor diode is made up of two different semiconductors which conducts well for one direction but not the other
- There is low resistance in one direction but higher resistance in the other
![[semi conductor diode.png]]
### Resistivity
- Resistivity is a property of the material, independent of the shape and size of the conductor
- Two pieces of conductor of the same shape and size but have different materials do not conduct equally well as they have different resistivities
  $$R=\frac{\rho l}{A}$$
- $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$), $\rho$: Resistivity ($\Omega m$), $l$: Length ($m$), $A$: Cross-sectional area ($m^2$)
## Internal resistance
- Internal resistance of a cell is resistance of the chemicals in the cell
![[internal resistance set up.png]]
- When switch S is open, the voltmeter gives the approximate value of the e.m.f of the cell
- But, when switch S is closed, the reading of the voltmeter is lower than that of the initial reading E, and there is a voltage loss
- The voltage loss is used to drive the current through the cell
$$E=V+Ir$$
- $E$: E.m.f. ($V$), $V$: Voltage ($V$), $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Internal resistance ($\Omega$)
### Maximum power theorem
- When there is no internal resistance, the power delivered to an external load of fixed resistance is constant

- But to find the maximum power delivered for a circuit with internal resistance, we need to vary $R$
![[maximum 200 power therom.png]]
$$E = I(R+r) \rightarrow I = \frac{E}{R+r}$$
$$P = IV = I^2R = (\frac{E}{R+r})^2R$$
- For maximum power dissipated, $\frac{dP}{dR}$ =0
$$\frac{dP}{dR} = E^2[\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}-\frac{2R(r+R)}{(R+r)^4}] =0$$
$$(R+r)^2 - 2R(r+R) = 0$$
$$R + r -2R =0$$
$$R = r$$
- Where $R$ = Total effective resistance of circuit ($\Omega$), $r$ = Internal resistance ($\ohm$)
- But, efficiency is only 50%, as half of the electrical energy is lost due to internal resistance
