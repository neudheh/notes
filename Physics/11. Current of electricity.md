## Current
- ==The current is the rate of flow of electric charge through a given cross-section of a conductor== $$I =\frac{dQ}{dt}$$
- For steady current, $$I = \frac{Q}{T}$$
- Where $I$: Current ($A$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $T$: Time ($s$)
- It has an SI unit of Ampere ($A$)
- In conductors, current is due to the flow of negative charges called electrons
- In semiconductors, which are made from materials from the Group IV elements of the periodic table, current is due to both positive holes and negative charges
- In ionised gasses and electrolytes, the charge carriers are the positive and negative electrons
### Conditional current
- Conventional current in a conductor is taken to be in the flow of positive charges
- For example, in metals, the positive charges (the ion cores) do not move, and the charge carriers are only negative
- Current direction is opposite to the direction of the flow of the negative charge carriers
- The positive charges add up with the negative charges
## Charge
- ==The charge which flows past a given cross section is the product of the steady current that flows past the section and the time during which the current flows== $$Q = It$$
- Where $Q$: Charge ($C$),  $I$: Current ($A$), $T$: Time ($s$)
- One coulomb ($C$) is the amount of electrical charge that passes through a given cross section of a circuit when a steady of current one ampere flows in one second
## Number density
- Consider charges drifting through a short section $\Delta x$ of cross sectional area $A$
- The volume of this section is $\Delta V = A\Delta x$ 
- The number of charge carriers in this section is $N = n\Delta V = nA \Delta x$, where $n$ is number density
- Hence the total charge would be $Q = (nA\Delta x)q$, where $q$ is the charge of a particle
- The average current is $I = \frac{nA\Delta x}{\Delta t}q$, where $\Delta t$ is the time required to travel a distance equal to $\Delta x$
- Since $V_d = \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}$, where $V_d$ is the drift speed of electrons, $$I = nAV_dq$$
- Where $I$: Current ($A$), $n$: Charge density, $V_d$: Drift speed of electrons ($m s^{-1}$), $q$: Charge ($C$)
## Mechanism of electrical conduction
### In metals
- In metals, there are many free electrons which are free to move throughout the atomic network
- Due to the thermal energy they posses, they move freely and randomly inside the metal
- Their direction of travel may change due to collisions with one another, and atoms in the metal, causing their motion to be haphazard
- Thus, there is no net flow of charge applied and there is no current
![[free electrons in metals.png]]
- But, when an external electric field $E$ is applied tot he metal, there will be an electrical force acting on the electrons
- The electrons drift opposite to the direction of $E$, while still keeping their random motion
- Thus, there is a net motion of electrons opposite to the direction of the electric field
- The speed at which electrons gradually flow is known as drift velocity
- The net flow of electrons (charges), constitutes an electric current 
### In intrinsic (pure) semiconductors
- Some examples of semiconductors are carbon, silicon, and germanium
- These substances have 4 electrons in their outermost shell, and neighbouring atoms are bonded together through covalent bonds, where the outer valence electrons are shared
- At room temperature, a valence electron may have sufficient energy to leave an atom and become a free electron
- This leaves a vacancy known as a hole, which has a net positive charge
- This free electron and hole constitute and electron-hole pair
- In a pure semiconductor , the number of free electrons is equal to the number of positive holes
- When a potential difference is applied across a semiconductor, the free electrons drift in one direction
- Some of the positive holes may be filled up by the drifting electrons or valence electrons
- When a valence electron from another atom fills a hole, the hole is transferred
- There is a drift of free electrons in one direction, and positive holes in the opposite direction
## Potential difference
- For current to flow, there must be an electric potential difference
- Current flows from higher potential to a lower potential
- ==The potential difference between two points in a circuit is the amount of electrical energy converted to other forms of energy per unit charge passing from one point to another== $$V=\frac{W}{Q}$$
- Where $V$: Potential difference ($V$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $Q$: Charge ($C$)
- Since $P = \frac{W}{t}$ and $I =\frac{Q}{t}$, $$V = \frac{P}{I}$$
- Where $V$: Potential difference ($V$), $P$: Power ($W$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- The volt is the potential difference between two points in a circuit if one joule of electrical energy is converted to other forms of energy per coulomb of charge passes from one point to another
- The volt is the potential difference between two points in a circuit such that one watt of power is dissipated per ampere of current flowing between the two points
### Electromotive force (e.m.f.)
- Other forms of energy can be transformed into electrical energy (e.g. batteries, thermocouple, generators)
- These are known as sources of e.m.f.
- ==The electromotive force (e.m.f.) of any source of electrical energy is the total energy converted into electrical energy per unit charge supplied== $$E = \frac{W}{Q}$$
- Where $E$: E.m.f. ($V$), $P$: Power ($W$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- E.m.f is the energy converted from non-electrical to electrical per unit charge delivered by the source of e.m.f.
- p.d. is the energy converted from electrical to non-electrical per unit charge per unit charge passing from one point to another
## Kilowatt-hour
- The kilowatt-hour is a unit of energy that is commonly used for converting electrical energy consumption in residential and commercial premises $$1kWh = 1kW \times 1hr = 3.6\times 10^6 J$$
## Resistance
- ==The resistance of a conductor is the ratio of the potential difference across the conductor to the current flowing through it== $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$
- Where $R$: resistance ($\ohm$), $V$: Voltage ($V$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- The ohm is the resistance of a conductor such that a current of one ampere flows in it per volt of p.d. applied across it
- Resistance is not the gradient of the V-I graph, it is rather the gradient of the line passing through the origin that passes through the point
### Ohm's law
- ==Ohm's law states that the current flowing through a conductor is directly proportional to the p.d. across it, provided temperature and other physical conditions are constant==
### Ohmic conductors
- Conductors obeying ohm's law are called ohmic conductors, such as pure metals
- For such conductors, a plot of I-V characteristics will give a straight line through the origin
- The resistance of an ohmic conductor is constant
![[ohmic conductors.png]]
- For non-ohmic conductors, their I-V characteristics are not straight lines passing through the origin
- When the current flowing through the conductor increases, because of joule heating, temperature will rise
- The amplitude of the atom's vibrations increases, and the free electrons collide more frequently with the atoms
- The electrons experience more obstruction, and resistance of the non-ohmic conductor rises
- The number of free electrons remain more or less the same
### Filament lamp
- The number of charge carriers does not change much
- R increases as temperature increases due to increase collisions of charge carriers with vibrating atoms, as the filament is metal
![[filament lamp.png]]
### Thermistor
- Thermistors are semiconductors where the resistance is sensitive to temperature
- The number of charge carriers increases markedly with increase in temperature
- Typically, thermistors have a negative coefficient of resistance, where resistance decreases as temperature increases
![[thermistor i-v graph.png]]
![[ntc thermistor.png]]
### Semiconductor diode
- It is a diode made up of two different semiconductors, which conducts well for one direction of current, but not the other
- It offers low resistance in one direction, but much higher resistance in the other
![[semi conductor diode.png]]
### Resistivity
- ==Resistivity is a property of the material, independent of the shape and size of the conductor==
- Two pieces of conductor of the same shape and size, but are made of different materials do not conduct equally well because they have different resistivities $$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$
- Where $R$: Resistance ($\ohm$), $\rho$: Resistivity ($\ohm m$), $l$: Length ($m$), $A$: Cross sectional area ($m^2$) 
## Internal resistance
- An approximate measurement of the e.m.f of a cell can be made by connecting a high resistance voltmeter across the terminals of the cell, with the switch S open
![[internal resistance set up.png]]
- But, when switch S is closed, the cell is connected to an external resistor R and the reading of the voltmeter V is lower than that of the initial reading E
- There is a voltage loss, as the drop in voltage is used to drive current through the cell
- There is internal resistance due to the resistance of the chemicals inside the cell $$E = V + Ir$$
- Where $E$: E.m.f ($V$), $V$: Potential difference ($V$), $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Internal resistance
### Maximum power theorem
- When there is no internal resistance, the power delivered to the external load of fixed resistance $R$ is constant
- But to find the maximum power delivered for a circuit with internal resistance, we need to vary $R$
![[maximum 200 power therom.png]]
$$E = I(R+r) \rightarrow I = \frac{E}{R+r}$$
$$P = IV = I^2R = (\frac{E}{R+r})^2R$$
- For maximum power dissipated, $\frac{dP}{dR}$ =0
$$\frac{dP}{dR} = E^2[\frac{1}{(R+r)^2}-\frac{2R(r+R)}{(R+r)^4}] =0$$
$$(R+r)^2 - 2R(r+R) = 0$$
$$R + r -2R =0$$
$$R = r$$
- Where $R$ = Total effective resistance of circuit ($\Omega$), $r$ = Internal resistance ($\ohm$)
- But, efficiency is only 50%, as half of the electrical energy is lost due to internal resistance
