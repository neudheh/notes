## Uniform circular motion
- When an object moves in a circular path with constant speed, the motion is called uniform circular motion
- It is not correct to use the four kinematics equations to solve problems involving circular motion, as the direction of acceleration is not constant (acceleration is not constant)
### Angular displacement
- ==Angular displacement is the angle an object makes with respect to a reference line== $$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$
- Where $\theta$: Angular displacement ($rad$), $s$: arc length (m), $r$: radius (m)
### Angular velocity
- ==Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement== $$\omega = \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$
- Where $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rad\ s^{-1}$), $\theta$: Angular displacement ($rad$), $t$: Time ($s$) 
### Period and frequency
- ==Period is the time taken for one complete revolution== 
- ==Frequency is the number of complete revolutions made per unit time==
- Frequency and period are related $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- For one revolution, the angular displacement $\theta = 2\pi\ rad$
- Hence, $$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$
- Where $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rad\ s^{-1}$), $T$: period ($s$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
### Tangential velocity
- ==Tangential velocity (linear velocity) refers to the linear velocity of a point moving in a circle==
- It is directed tangentially to the circular path
![[tangentinal velocity.png]]
- Consider a particle moving through a distance $s$ along the arc of a circle when it rotates an angle $\theta$ $$s = r\theta$$
- Differentiating with respect to $t$, $$\frac{ds}{dt} = r\frac{d\theta}{dt}$$ $$v = r\omega$$
- If the object is moving in uniform circular motion, the linear speed can be found by $$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
- Where $v$: Linear velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $s$: Distance ($m$), $r$: Radius ($m$), $\theta$: Angular displacement ($rad$),  $\omega$: Angular frequency
### Centripetal acceleration
- Consider a mass $m$ moving from point A to B along its circular path of radius $r$ with uniform speed $v$ around a fixed point O as the center
- At A, its initial velocity $V_A$ is tangent to the direction AC
- A short time later, $\Delta t$, at B, its final velocity $V_B$ is in the direction of direction BD
- Since the directions are different, the velocity $V_A$ is different from $V_B$, although magnitudes are equal
- This change in velocity causes an acceleration ![[centripetal acceleeration.png]]
- To find the direction of acceleration, we need to find the change in velocity $\Delta v$ 
- The direction of the change in velocity is also the direction of acceleration
- For an object in uniform circular motion, there must be no component of acceleration (force) in the direction of motion of the object
- If not, this will increase or decrease the speed of the object
- Therefore, the direction of this acceleration (force) must be perpendicular to the direction of motion
- This implies that acceleration is directed to the center of the circle
- An acceleration of this nature is called centripetal acceleration, and the force is called centripetal force
- From the vector diagram, $$\sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Delta v}{v}$$
- If angle $\theta$ is small,$\sin (\frac{\theta}{2}) \approx \frac{\theta}{2}$ $$\Delta v = v\theta$$$$a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v\theta}{\Delta t}$$$$a = v\omega=r\omega^2=\frac{v^2}{r}$$
- Where $a$: Centripetal acceleration ($ms^{-2}$),  $v$: Linear velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $r$: Radius ($m$),  $\omega$: Angular frequency($rad\ s^{-1}$)
## Centripetal force
- Newton's first law states that an object that is already moving will continue to move with uniform speed in a straight line 
- For an object moving in constant speed to execute uniform circular motion, where the direction of the object continually changes, an external force must act on an object
- From newton's second law, $F = ma$ $$F = mr\omega ^2 = \frac{mv^2}{r} = mv\omega$$
- Where $F$: Centripetal force ($N$),  $v$: Linear velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $r$: Radius ($m$),  $\omega$: Angular frequency($rad\ s^{-1}$)
- Centripetal force must be perpendicular to the direction of motion so that speed can be kept constant
- Since acceleration is towards to the centre of the circular path, centripetal force must thus act radially inwards
- Sudden removal of the force would allow the object to move along the tangent to the circular motion
- No work is done, as the object is moving in a circle, and the force is perpendicular to the displacement of the object throughout the circular motion
- Centripetal force is not a new force, and should not be included in a free body diagram
## Uniform circular motion in a horizontal circle
### Problem solving strategy
1. Draw a free body of diagram of the body under consideration
2. Identify the centre of the circle
3. Resolve the force along the two perpendicular axes, with one pointing towards the centre of the circle
4. Determine and equate the resultant force towards the centre to centripetal force
5. Equate the other force and make sure there is no net force, hence no net acceleration
### Why do cyclists lean when turning
![[Cyclist leaning.png]]
- Vertically, $N = mg$
- Horizontally, $f = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
- The centripetal fore required for the cyclist to execute the turn is provided by the frictional force $f$ acting on the bicycle
- This force provides a clockwise moment about the centre of gravity of the cyclist, causing him to turn outwards
- To achieve rotational equilibrium, the cyclist must lean inwards so that the normal force $N$ produces an anti-clockwise moment about the centre of gravity of the cyclist
### Banking
![[car without banking.png]]
- Vertically, $W=N$
- Horizontally, $f = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
- As the car travels faster, the centripetal acceleration required to maintain the same radius increases
- The friction needed to produce the acceleration must increase
- At some speed, the force required to keep the car on the circular path will be greater than the maximum friction provided by the track, and the car will skid off the track
- We can bank the road (tilt or slope it) 
![[banking.png]]
- The normal force $N$ is no longer vertical, and has a horizontal component which provides the centripetal force for the car
- Vertically, $N\cos\theta = mg$  - (1)
- Horizontally, $N\sin \theta = \frac{mv^2}{r}$ - (2)
- (2) / (1), $\tan \theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$
- The angle of banking is ideal if there is no need to provide the centripetal force, only the horizontal component of the normal force is providing centripetal force needed
- Banking cuts down wear on road surfaces on tyres
- It also cuts down noise and aids safety
## Uniform circular motion in a vertical circle
- A vertical circular motion is not uniform as the object speed changes due to gravity
- The object speeds up as it moves downwards and slows down as it approaches the top
![[bucket of water.png]]
- At the top, $$T_{top} + mg =\frac{mv^2}{r}$$
- At the bottom, $$T_{bottom} - mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
- Tension in the rod is changing as the object moves, smallest at the top and largest at the bottom
### Why won't the water in the bucket fall
- For the bucket to move in a circle, there must be a centripetal force acting on it
- The weight of the water and the normal contact force exerted at the bottom of the bucket provide the centripetal force
- As long as the normal contact is zero or greater, the water will stay in the bucket
- Hence, the water will not fall out of the bucket as long as the bucket is moving at a high enough speed such that centripetal force is larger than or equal to the weight of the water
### Graph of tension in the bucket
![[tension in the rod.png]]
## Non-uniform circular motion in a vertical circle
- Consider a car going through a vertical loop
![[loop the loop.png]]

- At the top,$$N_{top}+ mg = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r}$$
$$N_{top} = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r} -mg$$
- At the bottom, $$N_{bottom}- mg = \frac{mv_{bottom}\ ^2}{r}$$
$$N_{bottom} = \frac{mv_{bottom}\ ^2}{r} + mg$$
- Comparing the normal force at the bottom and the top, $N_{bottom} > N_{top}$
- The car is more likely to lose contact at the top
### Minimum speed
- For the train to remain on track thought the motion around the loop, set  $N_{top}$to be 0
- The presence of a normal force acting on the car means that it remains in contact with the track, and hence stays in the loop
- Hence, $$0 + mg = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r}$$$$v_{top, min} =\sqrt{gr}$$
- Using the principle of conservation of energy, we can find the minimum speed at the bottom
$$Total\ initial\ KE\ at\ bottom = Total\ final\ KE\ and\ GPE\ at\ the\ top$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}\ ^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{top}\ ^2 + mg (2r)$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}\ ^2 = \frac{1}{2}(gr) + mg (2r)$$
$$v_{bottom} = \sqrt{5gr}$$
