## Angular displacement
- ==Angular displacement is the angle an object makes with respect to a reference line==
- SI unit of radian or decree
- The radian is the angle subtended at the centre of a circle by an arc equal in length to the radius
$$\theta = \frac{s}{r}$$
- $\theta$: Angle measured in radians
- $s$: Arc length
- $r$: Radius
## Angular velocity
- ==Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement==
$$\omega = \frac{d \theta}{dt}$$
- $\omega$: Angular velocity
- $\theta$: Angle measured in radians
- $t$: Time taken
- SI unit of $rad \ s^{-1}$
### Period
- Period is the time taken for one complete revolution
- One revolution has an angular displacement of $2\pi$ 
- So, $$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
- $\omega$: Angular velocity
- $T$: Period
### Frequency
- Frequency is the number of complete revolutions made per unit time
$$T = \frac{1}{f}$$
- $T$: Period
- $f$: Frequency
So, $$\omega = 2\pi f$$
- $\omega$: Angular velocity
- $f$: Frequency
## Tangential/ Linear velocity 
- Tangential velocity refers to the linear velocity of a point moving in a circle, tangent to the circular path
![[tangentinal velocity.png]]
- A particle moving distance $s$ along the arc of a circle when it rotates through angle $\theta$
$$s=r\theta$$
- Differentiating with respect to t,
$$\frac{ds}{dt}= r \frac{d\theta}{dt}$$$$v=rw$$
- $v$: Tangential velocity
- $r$: Radius
- $w$: Angular velocity
- We can also use $$v = \frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
- $v$: Tangential velocity
- $r$: Radius
- $T$: Period
## Centripetal acceleration
- A mass is moving from point A to B along a circular path of radius $r$ with uniform speed $v$ 
- The initial velocity $V_A$ is in the direction AC
- But later, the final velocity $V_B$ is in the direction BD
- Since the magnitude of $V_A$ and $V_B$ are the same, but their directions are different, there is a change in velocity, and thus there is acceleration
![[centripetal acceleeration.png]]
- To find the change in acceleration of the mass, we need to find the change in velocity $\Delta V$
- The vector diagram shows the direction of change in velocity, which is also the direction of acceleration
- The direction of acceleration, and centripetal force must be perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object
- If there is acceleration (force) in the direction of motion of the object, It will speed up or slow down
- For a object undergoing uniform circular motion (constant speed), there must be no component of acceleration in the direction of the motion of the object
### Deriving the formula
- From the vector diagram, $$sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\frac{1}{2}\Delta V}{V_a}$$
- If $\theta$ is small, $sin(\frac{\theta}{2}) = \frac{\theta}{2}$ $$\Delta V= V_a \theta$$
- Since $a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ ,$$a = \frac{V_a \theta}{\Delta t}$$
$$a = v\omega = r \omega^2 = \frac{v^2}{r}$$
- $a$: Centripetal acceleration
- $v$: Linear velocity
- $\omega$: Angular velocity
- $r$: Radius
## Centripetal force
- Newton's first law states that an object is already moving will continue to move with uniform speed in a straight line unless compelled by an external force otherwise
- Hence, for circular motion to take place, as the direction of the object always changes, there much be an external acting on the object, known as centripetal force
- From Newton's second law, $F = ma$
$$F = mr\omega^2 = \frac{mv^2}{r} = mv\omega$$
- $F$: Centripetal force
- $v$: Linear velocity
- $\omega$: Angular velocity
- $r$: Radius
### Characteristics of centripetal force
- Centripetal force is perpendicular to the direction of motion, acting towards the centre of the circle
- Sudden removal of the force would allow the object to move along the tangent to the circular motion
- No work is done by centripetal force, as the direction of the force is perpendicular to the direction of motion of the object
>[!NOTE]
>Centripetal force is not a new type of force, it is only a resultant and should not be included in a free body diagram
## Uniform circular motion in a horizontal circle
### Problem solving strategy
1. Draw a free body diagram of the body under consideration
2. Identify the centre of the circle
3. Resolve the force along the two perpendicular axes, with one pointing towards the centre of the circle
4. Determine and equate the resultant force towards the centre to centripetal force
5. Equate the other forces and make sure there is no net force, hence no acceleration
### Why do cyclists lean when turning?
![[Cyclist leaning.png]]
- A cyclist is turning
- Vertically, $N = mg$
- Horizontally, $f= \frac{mv^2}{r}$
- The centripetal force required for the cyclist to execute the turn is provided by the frictional force $f$ acting on the bicycle
- This force provides a clockwise  moment about the centre of gravity of the cyclist, causing him to turn outwards
- To achieve rotational equilibrium, the cyclist must lean inwards so that the normal force $N$ produces and anticlockwise moment about the centre of gravity of the cyclist
### Banking
![[car without banking.png]]
- A car is turning on a flat track
- Vertically, $W = N$
- Horizontally, $f = \frac{mv^2}{r}$
- As the racing car travels faster, the centripetal acceleration required to maintain the same radius increases
- Therefore, the friction needed to produce this acceleration must increase
- At some particular speed, the force that is required to keep the car on the circular path will be greater than the maximum friction that can be provided by the track
- The car will skid off the track
- We can bank the road (tilt or slope the road)
 ![[banking.png]]
 - The normal force $N$ is no longer vertical, and has a horizontal component which provides the centripetal force for the car
 - Vertically, $Ncos\theta = mg$ - (1)
 - Horizontally, $Nsin\theta = \frac{mv^2}{r}$ - (2)
 - (2) / (1),  $tan \theta = \frac{v^2}{rg}$
 - The angle of banking is considered ideal if there is no need for friction to provide the centripetal force, only the horizontal component of the normal force is providing centripetal force needed
 - Banking cuts down on road surfaces and tyres
 - It also cuts down noise and aids safety
## Uniform circular motion in a vertical circle
- Vertical circular motion is usually not uniform as the object's speed changes due to gravity
- The object speeds up as it moves downwards and slows down as it approaches the top
![[bucket of water.png]]
- At the top, $$T_{top} + mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
-  At the bottom, $$T_{bottom} - mg = \frac{mv^2}{r}$$
- Tension in the rod is changing as the object rotates, smallest at the top and largest at the bottom
### Why won't the water in the bucket fall at a high speed
- For the water in the bucket to move in a circle, there must be a centripetal force acting on it
- The weight of the water and the normal contact force exerted at the bottom of the bucket on the water provide the centripetal force
- As long as the normal contact force is zero or greater, the water will stay in the bucket
- Hence the water will not fall out of the bucket as long as the bucket is moving with a high enough speed such that the centripetal force is larger than or just equal to the weight of the water
### Graph of tension in the bucket
![[tension in the rod.png]]
## Non-uniform circular motion in a vertical circle
- Consider a car going through a vertical loop
![[loop the loop.png]]

- At the top,$$N_{top}+ mg = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r}$$
$$N_{top} = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r} -mg$$
- At the bottom, $$N_{bottom}- mg = \frac{mv_{bottom}\ ^2}{r}$$
$$N_{bottom} = \frac{mv_{bottom}\ ^2}{r} + mg$$
- Comparing the normal force at the bottom and the top, $N_{bottom} > N_{top}$
- The car is more likely to lose contact at the top
### Minimum speed
- For the train to remain on track thought the motion around the loop, set  $N_{top}$to be 0
- The presence of a normal force acting on the car means that it remains in contact with the track, and hence stays in the loop
- Hence, $$0 + mg = \frac{mv_{top}\ ^2}{r}$$$$v_{top, min} =\sqrt{gr}$$
- Using the principle of conservation of energy, we can find the minimum speed at the bottom
$$Total\ initial\ KE\ at\ bottom = Total\ final\ KE\ and\ GPE\ at\ the\ top$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}\ ^2 = \frac{1}{2}mv_{top}\ ^2 + mg (2r)$$
$$\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}\ ^2 = \frac{1}{2}(gr) + mg (2r)$$
$$v_{bottom} = \sqrt{5gr}$$
