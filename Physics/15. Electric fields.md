## Electric force
- ==Coulomb's law states that the electric force $F$ between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them==
  $$F=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r^2}$$
- $F$: Electric force ($N$), $Q$: Charge ($C$) , $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
- According to Newton's third law, the forces on $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ make up an action-reaction pair
## Electric field
- ==An electric field is a region of space when an electric force will act on an electric charge==
- ==Electric field strength is the electric force exerted per unit positive test charge placed at that point==
  $$E=\frac{F}{q}=\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r^2}$$
  - $E$: Electric field strength ($NC^{-1}$), $F$: Electric force ($N$), $q$: Smaller charge ($C$), $Q$: Larger charge ($C$), $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
  - When defining electric field strength, the test particle must be stationery to exclude the possibility of a magnetic force acting on the particle
  - It is a vector
  - The direction of the electric field is in the direction of the electric force on a positive charge (or higher potential to lower potential)
  - A positive charge will experience a force in the same direction in the field, while a negative charge will experience a force in the opposite direction
  - For a non-uniform field, the direction of the field at a point is given by the tangent to the field line at that point
  - It can be represented by electric field lines
  - The closer the lines are, the stronger electric field in the area
  - The lines cannot cross or touch each other, and they need to be vectorially added
  - The lines are perpendicular to any conducting surface
### Positive/ negative monopole
  ![[positive monopole.png]]
  ![[negative monopole.png]]
### Conducting sphere
![[positively charged metal sphere.png]]
- Charges reside at the surface of the sphere, and are uniformly distributed
- The field acts in 3 dimensions and has spherical symmetry
- The electirc field inside the sphere is 0, and the electric field outside is like that of a point charge
### Charged metal sphere and plate
![[charged metal sphere and metal plate.jpeg]]
- Charges are not uniformly distributed, for the sphere it is highest at the bottom, while for the plate is is highest directly below the sphere
- Electric field lines are perpendicular to all the surfaces
### Sharp corners
![[sharp corners.png]]
- Sharp corners have higher charge densities, and the electric field strength than that of a flat surface
### Dipole
- A dipole is a pair of equal but opposite charges
- The direction of the electric field is the vector sum of the electric fields due to individual charges at that point
- if the charges are equal, the electric field will look symmetric
![[dipole.png]]
- But, if they are unequal, the electric field will be asymmetric, and the larger charge will have more field lines near it
![[unequal charges.png]]
## Motion of charged particles
![[speed of particle in uniform electric field.png]]
- Consider an electron with an initial speed of 0
- The electric field will exert an electric force on the electron and cause it to accelerate
- From $F=ma$ and $E=\frac{F}{Q}$, $a = \frac{eE}{m}$
- Using $v^2=u^2+2as$, $v^2=2(\frac{eE}{m})d\rightarrow v=\sqrt{2(\frac{eE}{m})d}$
- We can also use the conservation of energy
- Using $V=\frac{W}{Q}$, $W=VQ$
- All of the electric potential energy is converted to kinetic energy, hence $eV=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\rightarrow v = \sqrt{2\frac{eV}{m}}$
### Millikan's oil drop experiment
![[milikans oil drop experiment with no air resistance.png]]
- Consider an oil drop held stationary in mid air
- Ignoring upthrust on the oil drop, as the upthrust is small due to the density of air being low, there are only 2 forces on the air drop, weight and electric force
- Since the oil drop is stationary, $qE=mg$
- From $E=\frac{V}{d}$, $q\frac{V}{d}=mg$
![[milikans oil drop experoment with air resistance.png]]
- Consider an oil drop falling with terminal velocity
- There is a third force, air drag which points up, resisting the downward motion
- Air drag is proportional to speed
- Since the oil drop is falling with terminal velocity, air drag + electric force = weight
### Projectile motion
- Consider a negative charge $q$ with initial velocity $u$
![[projection of a charged particle into a uniform field.png]]
- Horizontally, there is no horizontal force, thus $a_x=0\rightarrow u_x=v_x$
- $x=ut\rightarrow t= \frac{x}{u}$
- Vertically, there is electric force, from $F=ma$, $qE=ma\rightarrow a=\frac{qE}{m}$
- From $s=ut+\frac{1}{2}at^2$, $y=\frac{qE}{2m}t^2\rightarrow y=\frac{qE}{2mu^2}x^2$ 
- Since this is in the form $y=kx^2$, the path is a parabola
## Electric potential
- Electric potential is the work done by an external force per unit positive charge in bringing a small test charge from infinity to that point
  $$V=\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}=\frac{W}{q}$$
- $V$: Potential ($V$), $Q$: Larger charge ($C$), $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$), $r$: Distance ($m$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $q$: Smaller charge ($C$)
- If $Q$ is positive, $V$ is positive, and if $Q$ is negative, $V$ is negative
- At $r=\infty$ , $V=0$ 
- Potential is a scalar
### Zero potential
- For an isolated charge, the point zero potential is infity
- For a system of charges, the point of zero potential could be at earth
- A conductor connected to earth is at zero potential
![[v-r graph.png]]
### Potential difference
- The potential difference between two points is the work done per unit positive charge in moving a small positive charge between the two points
- It is also equal to the difference between the potentials of the two points
### Potential gradient
- It can be proven that $E=-\frac{dV}{dr}$
- In an E-field, the electric field strength at a point is equal to the negative of the potential gradient at that point
### Charged parallel plates
- $E$ between charged parallel plates is constant, hence from $E=-\frac{dV}{dr}$, $\frac{dV}{dr}$ is also constant
- Thus, $\frac{\Delta V}{d}=-E$ 
### Equipotential surfaces
- An equipotential surface is a surface where all points have the same potential
- A charge placed on a equipotential surface will not move along the surface as all points have the same potential
- The E-field lines are perpendicular to the equipotential surface
- If they are not, there is a component of $E$ that is parallel to the surface, causing charges on it to move
- This contradicts the fact that charges do not move along an equipotential surface
![[equipotential lines and fields.png]]
### Variation of electric potential/ field strength of a spherical charged conductor
![[variation of electrical potential and field strength of. spherical charged conductor.png]]
## Electric potential energy
- ==Electric potential energy of a charge at a point in an electric field is the work done by an external force to bring the charge from infinity to that point==
$$U=\frac{Qq}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}=qV$$
- $U$: Electric potential energy ($J$), $Q$: Larger charge ($C$), $q$: Smaller charge ($C$),  $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$), $r$: Distance ($m$), $V$: Potential difference ($V$)
- If both charges have the same sign, $U$ is positive, else if both charges have different signed $U$ is negative
- If a charge in a electric field is released from rest, it will move from a point of higher $U$ to one of lower $U$
- Positive charges will move from a point of higher potential to one of lower potential
- Negative charges will move from a point of lower potential to one of higher potential
