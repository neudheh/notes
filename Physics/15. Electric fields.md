## Electric force
- ==Coulomb's law states that the electric force between two point charges is proportional to the product of the charges, and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them== $$F=\frac{Q_1Q_2}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r^2}$$
- Where $F$: Electric force ($N$), $Q$: charge ($C$), $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$) , $r$: Distance ($m$)
- The force on $Q_1$ and $Q_2$ make up and action-reaction pair
## Electric field
- ==An electric field is a region of space where an electric force acts on an electric charge==
- ==The electric field strength at a point is the electric force exerted per unit positive test charge placed at that point== $$E =\frac{F}{q} =\frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r^2}$$
- Where $E$: Electric field strength ($NC^{-1}$), $F$: Electric force ($M$), $q$: Smaller charge ($C$), $Q$: Bigger charge ($C$), $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$) , $r$: Distance ($m$)
- When defining electric field strength, the test particle must be stationary to exclude the possibility of a magnetic field acting on the particle
## Electric field lines
- Electric fields are vector fields, where the field at each point has a magnitude and a direction
- The direction of the electric field is in the direction of the electric force on a positive charge
- An electric field can be represented by electric field lines
- Each line has an arrow on it in the direction of the electric field
- The lines point from regions of higher electric potential to lower electric potential
- The closer the lines, the stronger the electric field in the area
- Electric field lines do not touch or cross each other
- Electric field lines are perpendicular to the conducting surface
- A positive charge will experience a force in the same direction as the filed
- A negative charge will experience a force in the opposite direction to the field
- For a non-uniform filed, the direction of the field at a certain point is the tangent of the field line at that point
- Electric fields need to be vectorially added
### Positive monopole
 $$E\propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
![[positive monopole.png]]
### Negative monopole
 $$E\propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
![[negative monopole.png]]
### Positively charged metal (conducting sphere)
![[positively charged metal sphere.png]]
- The charges will reside at the surface of the sphere
- The charges are uniformly distributed
- The field acts in 3 dimensions
- The filed has spatial symmetry
- The electric field inside the sphere is zero
- The electric field outside of the sphere looks like that of a point charge
### Charged metal sphere and metal plate
![[charged metal sphere and metal plate.jpeg]]
- Charge distributions on the sphere and plate are not uniform
- For the sphere, the charge density is highest at the bottom
- For the plate, charge density is highest directly below the sphere
- The field lines are perpendicular to all the metal surfaces
### Sharp corners
- Sharp corners have higher charge densities, and the electric field strength is stronger there
- Flat surfaces have lower charge densities, and the electric field is weaker there
![[sharp corners.png]]
### Dipole
- A dipole is a pair of equal but opposite charges
- The direction of the electric field at any point is the vector some of the electric fields due to the individual charges at that point
- If the two charges have equal magnitude, the electric field patterns will look symmetric
![[dipole.png]]
- But, if they have unequal magnitude, the electric field pattern will be asymmetrical, and the charge with more field lines drawn on it has a larger magnitude of charge
![[unequal charges.png]]
## Motion of a charged particle 
### Uniform electric field 
- Consider an electron of charge $e$ that is initially at rest in a uniform electric field with electric field strength $E$
![[speed of particle in uniform electric field.png]]
- It will be accelerated by the electric force $F$ and hit anode A with a final speed $v_f$
- To find the final speed $v_f$, we can use kinematics 
- From $F=ma$ and $E = \frac{F}{e}$, $$a= \frac{F}{M} = \frac{eE}{m}$$
- Using $v^2 = u^2+2as$, $$v_f = \sqrt{u^2+2as} = \sqrt{2(\frac{eE}{m})d}$$
- If $E$ isn't given, you can find it by using $E=\frac{V}{d}$
- We can also use conservation of energy
- Recall that $V = \frac{W}{Q}$
- Hence, the potential difference between the plates is $\frac{work\ done\ on\ an\ electron}{charge\ of\ an\ electron}$
- The work done is equal the the kinetic energy gained by the electron $$eV = \frac{1}{2}mv_f^2 - 0$$
$$v_f = \sqrt{\frac{2eV}{m}}$$
### Millikan's oil drop experiment
![[milikans oil drop experiment with no air resistance.png]]
- For a charged oil drop held stationary in mid air, ignoring upthrust (upthrust is negligibly small as the density of air is very low)
- There are only two forces actin on the oil drop, electric force and weight $$F_e = mg$$$$qE = mg$$
- Since $E = \frac{V}{d}$, $$q\frac{V}{d} = mg$$
![[milikans oil drop experoment with air resistance.png]]
- For a charged oil drop falling with terminal velocity $v$, there are three forces, electric force, weight, and air drag
- Air drag points up, resisting the downward motion
- Air drag is proportional to speed
- Since the oil drop is falling with terminal velocity, $$F_v + F_e =F_g$$
### Projected perpendicularly into a uniform E field
- Consider a negative charge $q$ moving with horizontal speed $u_x$
![[projection of a charged particle into a uniform field.png]]
- In the x-direction, there is no horizontal force $$a_x = 0$$$$v_x = u_x$$$$x = v_xt = u_xt$$
$$t = \frac{x}{u_x}$$
- In the y-direction, $$a_y = \frac{F_e}{m} = \frac{qE}{m}$$
$$v_y = u_y + a_yt$$$$v_y = 0 + \frac{qE}{m}t\ (u_y = 0)$$
$$y = u_yt + \frac{1}{2}a_yt^2$$
$$y = \frac{qE}{2m}t^2$$
$$y = \frac{qE}{2mu_x^2}x^2$$
- Since this is of the form $y = kx^2$, the path is a parabola
## Electric potential
- ==Electric potential at a point is the work done by an external force per unit positive charge in bringing a small test charge from infinity to that point ==$$V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}$$
- Where $V$: Electric potential ($V$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$) , $r$: Distance ($m$)
- If $Q$ if positive, $V$ is positive, and if $Q$ is negative, $V$ is negative, the negative sign cannot be left out when calculating
- At $r=\infty$ , $v =0$
- Potential is a scalar, and can be added together
- Alternatively, $$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$
- Where $V$: Electric potential ($V$), $W$: Work done ($J$), $Q$: Charge ($C$)
- For an isolated charge, the point of zero is at infinity
- For a system of charges, the point of zero potential can be at earth
- A conductor connected to earth is at zero potential
### V-r graphs
![[v-r graph.png]]
### Potential difference
- ==The potential difference between two points is the work done per positive unit charge in moving a small positive charge between two points==
- Potential difference is also equal to the difference between the potentials of the two points
### Potential gradient
- Comparing $E = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r^2}$ and $V = \frac{Q}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r}$, $$E =-\frac{dV}{dr}$$
- In an electric field, the electric field strength at a point is equal to the negative of the potential gradient at that point
### Field strength and potential between charged parallel plates
- $E$ between parallel plates is constant
![[potential and electric field between parallel plates.png]]
### Equipotential surfaces
- An equipotential surface is a surface where all points have the same potential
- A charged placed on such a surface will not move long it
- E-field lines are always perpendicular to an equipotential surface
- If they are not perpendicular, there is a component of E that is parallel to the surface, causing the charges to move
- This contradicts the fact that the charges will not move along an equipotential surface
![[equipotential lines and fields.png]]
### Variation of electric potential and field strength of a spherical charged conductor
![[variation of electrical potential and field strength of. spherical charged conductor.png]]
## Electric potential energy
- Electric potential energy of a charge at a point in a electric field is the work done by an external force to bring the charge from infinity to that point $$U = \frac{qQ}{4\pi\varepsilon_0r} = qV$$
- Where $U$: Electric potential energy ($U$), $Q$: Big charge ($C$), $q$: Smaller charge ($C$) $\varepsilon_0$: Permittivity of free space ($8.85\times10^{-12}Fm^{-1}$) , $r$: Distance ($m$), $V$: Electric potential ($V$)
- If both charges have the same sign, $U$ is positive, else if both charges have different signed $U$ is negative
- If a charge in a electric field is released from rest, it will move from a point of higher $U$ to one of lower $U$
- Positive charges will move from a point of higher potential to one of lower potential
- Negative charges will move from a point of lower potential to one of higher potential
