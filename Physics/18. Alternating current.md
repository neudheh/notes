## Alternating current
- In direct current (DC), the charge carriers only flow in one direction (i.e. the drift velocity of the electrons is only in one direction)
- This is because the polarity of the e.m.f. remains constant with time
- In alternating current (AC), the direction of current flow alternates between the forward and backward direction
- This is due to the polarity of the e.m.f. changing periodically with time
- Usually, alternating current takes on a sinusoidal waveform
### Characteristics
![[ac current and voltage.png]]
- In AC, the current flow changes direction over a time interval
- In a sinusoidal alternating current, both the direction and magnitude of the current varies with time in a periodic manner
- The voltage source that supplies the sinusoidal alternating current varies sinusoidally as well
- A positive current flow is taken to be in a clockwise direction, and a negative current implies that the current is now flowing in the opposite direction (anti-clockwise direction)
### Terminology
![[AC terminology.png]]
- In an $I-t$ graph, the cycle is one complete alternation of $I$
- The period is the time taken to complete one cycle
- The frequency is the number of complete cycles per unit time, Singapore has a frequency of $50Hz$
- The instantaneous current is the value of the current at a particular instant of time
- The peak current value ($I_0$) is the maximum value of the current in one cycle, or the amplitude of the AC
- Peak to peak value is the difference between the positive and negative peak values, for a sinusoidal AC, it is $2I_0$
- The angular frequency $\omega = 2\pi f$, measured in $rad\ s^{-1}$
-  The AC current can be represented by the following equation $$I = I_0\sin\omega t$$
- Where $I$: Current ($A$), $I_0$: Peak current ($A$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ( $rad\ s^{-1}$), $t$: Time ($s$)
- The voltage and e.m.f can also be similarly represented $$V = V_0\sin\omega t,  \varepsilon= \varepsilon_0\sin\omega t$$
## Root-mean-square values
- The average value of a sinusoidal AC in a complete cycle is zero, which is not representative of the physical situation
- The power dissipated in the external load cannot be zero
- Hence, the average current, which is zero, is not an effective representation of the AC
- The peak value of the AC signal is also not representative of the full cycle
- Since the power dissipated in the external load is directly proportional to $I^2$ ($P = I^2R$), the average value of $I^2$ is more representative of the varying current
- The root-mean-square value (the square root of the average value of $I^2$) is an effective representation of the varying current
- ==The rms value of an alternating current/ voltage is the equivalent value of the steady direct current/ voltage that will produce thermal energy at the same average rate in a given resistor==
![[rms values.png]]
- A resistor is connected to both a DC source and an AC source
- The power dissipated in the dc source is $$P_{DC} = I_{DC}^2 R$$
-  As the power dissipated by the resistor connected to the AC source varies from one instant to the next, we should consider the average power dissipated instead $$<P_{AC}> = <I_{AC}^2R>$$$$<P_{AC}> = <I_{AC}^2>R$$
- Suppose that both resistors are dissipating energy at the same average rate $$P_{DC} = <P_{AC}>$$
$$I_{DC}^2 R = <I_{AC}^2>R$$$$I_{DC}^2 = \sqrt{<I_{AC}^2>} = I_{rms}$$
- Hence the root mean square current is equivalent to a steady direct current that causes the energy dissipated to be the same rate as the average power dissipated in an identical resistor connected to an AC supply
- By using rms values, many calculations for AC circuits can be done as they would have been for DC circuits
### rms for a sinusoidal source
- The current in an AC source is given by $I = I_0\sin\omega t$
- Squaring gives us $I^2 = I_0^2\sin^2\omega t$
![[r.m.s for sinusoidal AC.png]]
- The average is $\frac{I_0^2}{2}$ 
- Hence, the root mean square value for a sinusoidal source is given by $I_{rms} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$
### Power dissipated in a resistive load
- Suppose a sinusoidal voltage is applied across a resistor
- The instantaneous current $I$ passing through the resistor is $$I = \frac{V}{R} = \frac{V_0\sin\omega t}{R}$$$$I = \frac{V_0}{R}\sin\omega t = I_0\sin\omega t$$
- Thus, both the voltage and current vary sinusoidally, and are in phase
- Hence the power dissipated by the resistor varies with time$$P = I^2R = (I_0\sin\omega t)^2R = I_0^2R\sin^2\omega t$$
- Hence, $$P = P_0\sin^2\omega t$$
- Where $P$: Power ($W$), $P_0$: Peak power ($W$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ( $rad\ s^{-1}$), $t$: Time ($s$)
![[power in ac.png]]
- The peak power is given by $$P_0 = I_0^2R = I_0V_0 = \frac{V_0^2}{R}$$
- The mean or average power is given by $$<P> = <P_0\sin^2\omega t>$$$$<P> = P_0 <\sin^2\omega t>$$$$<P> =\frac{P_0}{2}$$
- Additionally, $$<P> = \frac{P_0}{2} = \frac{I_0V_0}{2} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}} = V_{rms}I_{rms}$$
$$<P> = \frac{P_0}{2} = \frac{I_0^2R}{2} = \frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}^2R = I_{rms}^2 R$$
$$<P> = \frac{P_0}{2} = \frac{1}{2}\frac{V_0^2}{R} = (\frac{V_0}{\sqrt{2}})^2\frac{1}{R} = \frac{V_{rms}^2}{R}$$
## Transformers
- A transformer is an electrical device that takes the voltage of an alternating supply and changes it into another alternating voltage
- The transformer is essential for transmission of electricity over great distances
- It consists of two coils of insulated wires wound on a soft iron core
- The two coils are called the primary and secondary coils respectively
![[transformer.png]]
- An alternating e.m.f $V_p$ is applied across the primary coil, generating an alternating current $I_p$ in the primary coil that is in phase with $V_p$
- This alternating current gives rise to an alternating magnetic flux $\phi$ that is in phase with $I_p$
- This alternating magnetic flux in the soft iron core is linked to the secondary coil
- The most important function of the soft-iron core is to improve the magnetic flux linkage between the primary and secondary coils
- Since $\phi$ is changing, by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, and e.m.f $V_s$ will be induced in the secondary coil
- $V_s$ is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux linkage with the secondary coil, so $V_s$ will be alternating at the same frequency as $V_p$
- If a load is connected to the secondary coil, a current $I_s$ will flow in the secondary coil of the transformer, and transfer energy from the primary circuit to the secondary circuit
### Equations
- For an ideal transformer, the power supplied from the primary circuit will be fully transferred to the secondary output 
- We can neglect the resistance of the coils 
- We can also assume all the magnetic flux is confined to the iron core, so at any instant the magnetic flux is the same in the primary and secondary coils
$$V_pI_p = V_sI_s$$
$$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{I_p}{I_s}$$
- It can be showed that $$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p}$$
- Thus, $$\frac{V_s}{V_p} = \frac{N_s}{N_p} = \frac{I_p}{I_s}$$
- Where $V$: Voltage ($V$), $N$: Number of turns in the coil, $I$: Current ($A$)
- You can use all rms values, or all peak values, but you cannot mix and match
- The ratio $\frac{N_s}{N_p}$ is the turns ratio
- If $N_s$> $N_p$, we have a step-up transformer, and $V_s$ > $V_p$
- If $N_s < N_p$, we have a step-down transformer, and $V_s < V_p$
### Why transformers only work with AC
- Transformers work only with AC and not DC, as an alternating magnetic field is needed
- DC can only produce a steady magnetic field
- We can also use a pulsed DC (unidirectional current of varying magnitude) to create a changing magnetic field, but it is not as easy to generate as a sinusoidal AC
### Power losses
- Copper losses, due to joule heating when current flows in the copper wires associated with the transformer, which is minimised by using thicker wires
- Iron losses, due to eddy currents set up by the alternating magnetic flux in the iron core, which can be reduced by using a laminated core 
- It is made out of iron sheets that are electrically insulated from one another
- This reduces the size of eddy currents which inevitably form and thus reduces the energy losses
- Flux leakage, due to incomplete linkage of the primary magnetic flux with the secondary coil
- The design of the iron core and its shape will determine the level of flux leakage
- Hysteresis loss, due to continual changes in the magnetisation of the soft iron core, resulting in thermal energy being generated
- The loss can be reduced by carefully selecting core material that has a very small hysteresis loss like mumetal
### Transmission of electrical power
- At a power station, step-up transformers are used, where the primary coil is connected to the power generator, and the secondary coil is connected to the transmission lines
- Let the electrical power generated be $P_{gen}$, delivered at a transmission voltage $V_{tr}$
- The current in the cables will be $I = \frac{P_{gen}}{V_{tr}}$
- The power loss is given by $$P_{loss} = I^2R = (\frac{P_{gen}}{V_{tr}})^2R_{cable}$$
- Therefore, $$P_{loss} \propto \frac{1}{V_{tr}^2}$$
- The higher the voltage at which power is transmitted, the lower the power loss as thermal energy in the cables
- Hence, electricity is transmitted at high voltages and low currents
- Near the consumer, step downs transformers lower the high transmission voltage to a value suitable for home use or industry
### AC vs DC
- The transformer's ability to step AC voltages up and down easily provides AC with an advantage over DC in power distribution, making it practical
- Without this ability, it would be costly to construct power systems for close-range transmission, and thicker wires are be needed to keep the resistance and power loss low
## Rectification
- AC current is suitable for heating and lighting because the heating effect of a current is independent of the currents direction
- But, in many practical systems, the use of an AC current is not viable, such as a computer, where current needs to be in one direction only
- Rectification is the process of converting AC to DC
- A diode is a circuit component that allows electric current to flow through it in only one direction
- It has a low resistance in one direction (forward bias), and a higher resistance in the reverse (reverse bias)
- If the voltage is too low, the diode will not allow a current through
### Half-wave rectification
![[half wave rectification.png]]
- The diode conducts during the first half cycle when it is forward biased, and terminal A is positive with respect to terminal B
- A pulse of current thus flows around the circuit
- The potential difference across load R is approximately equal to the input alternating voltage
- In the second half-cycle. the diode is reverse biased, and terminal A is negative with respect to terminal B
- No current flows and voltage across R is zero
- The rectified potential difference across R thus appears as a series of pulses
