## Terms and definitions
- ==An oscillation is the periodic motion of an object about some fixed position, back and forth, along the same path==
- Harmonic motion is any motion that repeats itself in equal intervals of time
- Simple harmonic motion (SHM) is motion that can be described by a single sinusoidal function

- ==Equilibrium position is the position at which no net force acts on the oscillating mass==
- ==Displacement is the distance of an oscillating mass from its equilibrium position at any instant in a stated direction==
- ==Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the oscillating mass from the equilibrium position==
- ==Period is the time taken for one complete oscillation==
- ==Frequency is the number of oscillation per unit time made by the oscillating object==
  $$f =\frac{1}{T}$$
- $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
- ==Angular frequency is the product of frequency and $2\pi$==
  $$\omega=2\pi f$$
- $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$), $f$: frequency ($Hz$)
- Phase expresses at which stage the oscillator is within the cycle of an oscillation
- It describes the
	- physical position and velocity of the oscillator
	- where the oscillator is on a displacement-time graph
	- the angle of the point representing the oscillator that moves around a reference circle
## Displacement, velocity, acceleration of SHM as a function of time
- If timing starts at the center of the oscillation, $$x=x_0\sin\omega t$$
- If timing starts at the extreme ends of the oscillation, $$x=x_0\cos\omega t$$
- $x$: Displacement ($m$), $x_0$: Amplitude ($m$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$), $t$: time ($s$)
![[displacement velocity acceleration as a function of time shm.png]]
- Displacement, velocity, and acceleration all vary sinusoidally with time
- Maximum velocity is $\omega x_0$ when the oscillator is at the equilibrium; minimum velocity is $0$ when the oscillator is at the extreme ends
- Maximum acceleration is $\omega^2x_0$ at the extreme ends; minimum acceleration is $0$ at equilibrium
## Displacement, velocity, acceleration of SHM as a function of time
- Substituting displacement ($x=x_0\sin\omega t$) into acceleration $a=-\omega^2x_0\sin\omega t$, $$a=-\omega^2x$$
- $a$: acceleration ($ms^{-2}$), $\omega$: angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$), $x$: displacement ($m$)
- ==SHM is a to-and-fro motion where acceleration of an object is directly proportional to its displacement from a fixed equilibrium position, and opposite in direction to displacement==
- Rewriting displacement ($x=x_0\sin\omega t\rightarrow\sin\omega t=\frac{x}{x_0}$) and velocity ($v = \omega x_0\cos\omega t\rightarrow\cos\omega t = \frac{v}{\omega x_0}$), and using $\sin^2\omega t+\cos^2\omega t=1$, $(\frac{x}{x_0})^2+(\frac{v}{\omega x_0})^2=1$
- Hence, $$v=\pm\omega\sqrt{x_0^2-x^2}$$
- $v$: velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$), $x_0$: Amplitude ($m$), $x$: Displacement ($m$)

![[simple harmonic motion and circular motion.png]]
- The vertical height of the displacement of the shadow can be found by using $x = -rcos\omega t$

>[!NOTE] 
>To prove something is in simple harmonic motion, show how the acceleration is directly proportional to displacement by differentiating it 2 times
## Dynamics of SHM
- Acceleration $a=-\omega^2x$
- Therefore, $F=ma=-m\omega^2x$
- By newton's second law, there must be a net force for SHM which is proportional to displacement, and opposite in direction
![[dyanmics shm.png]]
- At all positions, the net restoring force $F_{net}=-kx$
## Energy of SHM
### Kinetic energy
$$E_K=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=\frac{1}{2}m(\omega\sqrt{x_0^2-x^2})^2=\frac{1}{2}m(\omega x_0\cos\omega t)^2$$
- For maximum $E_k$, $$E_{kmax} = \frac{1}{2}m\omega x_0^2$$
### Total energy
- The total energy is equal to the maximum kinetic energy
$$E_{total} = \frac{1}{2}m\omega x_0^2$$
### Potential energy
- Potential energy $E_p = E_{Total} - E_{k}$
$$E_P = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(\omega x_0\sin\omega t)^2$$
![[energy graphs shm.png]]
- There are two cycles of $E_K$ in one period
## Damping
- ==Damping is where energy is taken from an oscillating system due to dissipative forces==
- ==Damped oscillations are oscillations where there is a continuous transfer of energy to the surroundings due to dissipative forces such that energy in the system decreases with time, causing amplitude of the motion progressively decreases with time==
- ==Forced oscillations are caused by a continuous input of energy by an external source to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation==
### Light damping
- Amplitude decreases exponentially over a long time
- Period remains the same as if the system is undamped
![[light damping.png]]
### Critical damping
- No oscillations occur
- Time taken for displacement to become 0 is a minimum
![[critical damping.png]]
### Heavy damping
- No oscillations occur
- Takes a longer time to return to equilibrium position
![[heavy damping.png]]
## Resonance
- As damping causes energy to be lost, an external energy source is needed to maintain the amplitude of oscillation
- The external energy source providing the energy is the driving force, while the oscillator is the driven system, which undergoes forced oscillations
- Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency that depends on the dimensions and nature of material
- When the driving frequency of the driving force is approximately equal to natural frequency, the amplitude of oscillation is maximum and the system is in resonance
- ==Resonance is a phenomenon where a system responds with maximum amplitude to an external driving force==
- At resonance, there is a maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system
### Frequency response graph
![[Frequency response graph.png]]
- The amplitude will increase to a maximum at the resonant frequency, where driver frequency = resonant frequency, then decrease as driving frequency is increased further
- With no damping, the amplitude of the oscillation is theoretically infinitely large magnitude at the resonant frequency
- This is becuase there is a continuous input of energy without any energy losses
- In practice, damping always exists, and the final amplitude is when the rate of energy gained from the driving force equals to the rate of energy dissipation to the surroundings
- As the degree of damping increases
	- The amplitude of the peak decreases
	- The peak becomes broader as it spreads over a wider range of frequencies (response is less sharp)
	- Resonance occurs at a frequency smaller than the natural frequency
