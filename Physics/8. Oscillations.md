## Oscillation
- ==An oscillation is the periodic motion of an object about some fixed position, back and forth, along the same path==
- ==Free oscillations are oscillations that do not have a constant input of energy==
- ==Periodic (or harmonic) motion is any motion that repeats itself in equal intervals of time==
- Moion that can be described by a single sinusoidal motion are called simple harmonic motions (SHM)
## Simple harmonic motion
![[oscillating spring.png]]
- ==Equilibrium position is the position at which there is no net force acting on the oscillating mass==
- ==Displacement ($x$) is the distance of the oscillating mass from its equilibrium position at any instant in a stated direction==
- ==Amplitude ($x_0$) is the maximum displacement of the oscillating mass from the equilibrium position 
- ==Period ($T$) is the time taken for one complete oscillation==
- It has the SI unit of seconds ($s$)
- ==Frequency is the number of complete oscillations per unit time made by the oscillating object==
- It has the SI unit of Hertz ($Hz$)
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- where $f$ = Frequency ($Hz$),  $T$ = period ($s$)
- ==Angular frequency is the product of frequency and $2\pi$
- It has the SI unit of radians per second ($rad\ s^{-1}$)
$$ \omega = 2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
- where $\omega$ = angular frequency ($rad\ s^{-1}$),  $f$ = Frequency ($Hz$),  $T$ = period ($s$)
- Phase expresses at which stage the oscillator is within the cycle of an oscillation
- It 
	- describes the physical position and velocity of the oscillator
	- indicates where the oscillator is represented on a displacement-time graph
	- indicates the angle of the point (representing the oscillator) that moves about a reference circle
## Displacement, velocity and acceleration as a function of time
- If the oscillation starts from the equilibrium position,
$$x = x_0\sin (\omega t)$$
- Where $x$ = displacement ($m$), $x_0$ is the amplitude ($m$), $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$) , $t$ is the time ($s$)
- If the oscillation starts from maximum displacement,
$$x = x_0\cos (\omega t)$$
- Where $x$ = displacement ($m$), $x_0$ is the amplitude ($m$), $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$) , $t$ is the time ($s$)
- For an object that starts at the equilibrium position,
$$x = x_0\sin (\omega t)$$
$$V = \frac{dx}{dt} = \omega x_0cos(\omega t)$$
$$a = \frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega^2 x_0 sin(\omega t)$$
- Where $x$ is the displacement ($m$), $V$ is the velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $A$ is the acceleration ($ms^{-2}$) , $x_0$ is the amplitude ($m$), $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$) , $t$ is the time ($s$)
![[displacement velocity acceleration as a function of time shm.png]]
- Displacement, velocity and acceleration all vary sinusoidally with time
- Maximum velocity is when the oscillator is at the equilibrium and is given by $\omega x_0$
- Minimum velocity is when the oscillator is at the extreme positions and is equal to 0
- Maximum acceleration is when the oscillator is at the extreme positions and is given by $\omega ^2 x_0$
- Minimum acceleration is when the oscillator is at the equilibrium and is equal to 0
## Velocity and acceleration as a function of displacement
- Looking at the equations for displacement and acceleration, $$x = x_0 sin\omega t$$$$a = -\omega ^2x_0 sin\omega t$$
- Hence, $$a = -\omega ^2 x$$
- Where $x$ is the displacement ($m$), $A$ is the acceleration ($ms^{-2}$) , $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$)
- This is the defining equation for SHM and it shows that acceleration is directly proportional in magnitude but opposite in direction to the displacement$$a \propto -d$$
- ==Simple Harmonic Motion (SHM) is a to-and-fro motion in which the acceleration of an object is proportional to its displacement from a fixed equilibrium position, and acts in an opposite direction to the displacement==
- Rewriting equations for displacement and velocity,$$x = x_0 sin\omega t \Rightarrow\sin \omega t = \frac{x}{x_0}$$
$$v = \omega x_0 cos \omega t \Rightarrow cos\omega t =  \frac{v}{\omega x_0}$$
- Using $sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$,$$(\frac{x}{x_0})^2 + (\frac{v}{wx_0})^2 = 1$$
$$\omega ^2x^2 + v^2 = \omega^2x_0^2$$
$$v = \pm \omega \sqrt{x_0^2 - x^2}$$
- Where $x$ is the displacement ($m$), $V$ is the velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $x_0$ is the amplitude ($m$), $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$)

- The vertical height of the displacement of the shadow can be found by using $x = -rcos\omega t$
>[!NOTE] 
>To prove something is in simple harmonic motion, show how the acceleration is directly proportional to displacement by differentiating it 2 times

## Dynamics of SHM
- By newton's second law,$$F = ma = -m\omega ^2 x$$
- Where $F$ is the force ($N$), $x$ is the displacement ($m$), $A$ is the acceleration ($ms^{-2}$) , $\omega$ is the angular frequency ($rad ^{-1} s$)
- Therefore, there must be a net force for SHM to occur, which is proportional to displacement and in opposite direction do displacement
- This net force is called the restoring force since it is always directed to the equilibrium position, opposite to displacement
For example a mass spring system ![[dyanmics shm.png]]
- At all positions, net restoring force is $$F_{net} = -kx$$
## Energy in SHM
### Kinetic energy 
$$v = \pm \omega \sqrt{x_0^2 - x^2}$$
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$$
$$E_k = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2 (x_0^2 - x^2) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2x_0^2 cos^2(\omega t)$$
- For maximum $E_k$, $$Max\ E_{K} = \frac{1}{2}mx_{0}^{2}\omega ^2$$
## Total energy
- Total energy = Maximum $E_K$
$$E_T= \frac{1}{2}mx_{0}^{2}\omega ^2$$
### Potential energy
$$E_p = E_t - E_k =  \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2 x^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2\sin(\omega t)$$

- There are two cycles of KE in one period
## Damping
- ==Damping is the process whereby energy is take from an oscillating system because of dissipative forces==
- ==Damped oscillations are oscillation in which there is a continuous transfer of energy to the surroundings due to dissipative forces such that the energy in the system decreases with time, causing the amplitude of the motion to decrease progressively with time==
### Light damping
- The amplitude of oscillation decreases approximately exponentially over a long time
- Period remains nearly the same as if the system is undamped
- Used in meters which need to show rapid fluctuations such as level meters in audio equipment
![[light damping.png]]
### Critical damping
- No oscillations occur
- Time taken for displacement to become zero is a minimum
- Used in meter which requires the needle to not oscillate at the final reading (Car speedometers, voltmeters, ammeter) and car suspension systems

>[!NOTE]
>Car suspension systems ensure a comfortable ride for passengers when a car is moving on a bumpy road
>It uses shock absorbers or oil dampers, dissipating away the bounding motion in the shortest period of time, providing critical damping

![[critical damping.png]]
### Heavy damping
- No oscillations occur about the equilibrium position when the damping force increases beyond the point of critical damping
- The oscillator takes a longer time to return the the equilibrium position relative the the critically damped system
- Used in meters which are required to ignore transient changes (car fuel gauges), or large heavy doors which are heavily damped to prevent slamming
 ![[heavy damping.png]]
## Forced oscillations
- ==Forced oscillations are oscillations when there is a continuous input of energy by an external source to an oscillating system  to compensate for energy loss to due to damping to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation==
- This is because damping causes energy to be lost, and an external energy source is required to maintain oscillations at the same amplitude
- The external energy source providing the energy is called the driving force
- The oscillator is the driven system, which undergoes force oscillation due to the driving force
- When a system is subjected to a driving force of frequency $f$, and there is a transfer of energy the system will undergo forced oscillation
## Resonance
- Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency which depends on it dimensions and nature of material
- When the driving frequency is approximately equivalent to natural frequency, and amplitude of vibration of the system becomes a maximum
- ==This is known as resonance, which is the phenomenon in which a system responds will maximum amplitude to an external driving force==
- At resonance, there is a maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system
## Frequency response graph
- The frequency response graph is a graph where the amplitude of oscillation is plotted against driving frequency
- As frequency increases, the amplitude increases
- The amplitude of oscillation is maximum at the resonant frequency (where driver frequency is equal to natural frequency)
- Afterwards, as frequency increases, the amplitude decreases
- As the degree of damping increases
	- The amplitude of the peak decreases
	- The peak becomes broader as it spreads over a wider range of frequencies
	- Resonance occurs at a frequency smaller than the natural frequency
- Theoretically, with no damping, the amplitude of oscillation should be of infinitely large magnitude at the resonant frequency
- This is because there is a continuous input of energy with no energy loss
- In practise, damping always exists and the final amplitude is reached when the rate of energy gained from the drivers source is equal to the rate of energy dissipation to the surroundings
