- ==An oscillation is a periodic motion of an object about a certain mean equilibrium position with a continuous interchange of kinetic energy and potential energies==
- ==Free oscillation are to-and-fro motions that do not have a constant input of energy==
- Motions that can be described that a single sinusoidal function (sin/ cos) are known as simple harmonic motion
## Simple harmonic motion
![[oscillating spring.png]]
- ==Equilibrium/ neutral position is the position at which no net force acts on the oscillating mass==
- ==Displacement is the distance of the oscillating mass from the equilibrium position==, having an SI unit of metres ($m$)
- ==Amplitude is the maximum displacement of the oscillating mass from its equilibrium position==, having an SI unit of metres ($m$)
- ==Period is the time taken for 1 complete oscillation==, having an SI unit of seconds ($s$)
- ==Frequency is the number of complete oscillations per unit time made by the oscillating object==, having an SI unit of Hertz ($Hz$)$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
	- $f$: frequency
	- $T$: Period
- ==Angular frequency of an oscillation is the product of frequency and 2Ï€==, having an SI unit of radians per second ($rad\ s^{-1}$)$$\omega = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
	- $\omega$: Angular frequency
	- $T$: Period
- ==Phase is an angle in degrees or radians which gives a measure of the fraction of a cycle that has been completed by an oscillating particle or by a wave==
- ==Phase difference is a measure of how much one wave is out of step with another, measured in degrees or radians==
- Phase 
	- describes the physical position and velocity of the oscillator
	- Indicates where the oscillator is represented on a displacement-time graph
	- Indicates the angle of the point (representing the oscillator) that moves around a reference circle
## Displacement, velocity and acceleration as a function of time
- If the object starts from the centre of oscillation, $$x = x_0 sin \omega t$$
- If the object starts from the maximum displacement, $$x = x_0 cos \omega t$$
	- $x_0$: Amplitude
	- $\omega$: Angular frequency
	- $t$: Time
- For an object that starts from equilibrium position,
$$Displacement: x = x_0 sin\omega t$$$$Velocity: v = \frac{dx}{dt}= \omega x_0 cos\omega t$$
$$Acceleration: a = \frac{dv}{dt} = -\omega ^2x_0 sin\omega t$$
![[displacement velocity acceleration as a function of time shm.png]]

- Displacement, velocity and acceleration all vary sinusoidally with time
- Maximum velocity is attained when the oscillator is at the equilibrium and is given by $v_{max} = \omega x_0$ 
- Minimum velocity is attained when the oscillator is at the extreme positions and is given by $v_{min} = 0$
- Maximum acceleration is attained when the oscillator is at the extreme positions and is given by $a_{max} = \omega ^2 x_0$
- Minimum acceleration is attained when the oscillator is at the equilibrium position and is given by $a_{min} = 0$
>[!NOTE]
>To get maximum and minimum acceleration/ velocity, let $sin \omega t/ cos \omega t$  equal to 1 for maximum, and 0 for minimum
## Velocity and acceleration as a function of displacement
- Looking at the equations for displacement and acceleration, $$Displacement: x = x_0 sin\omega t$$$$Acceleration: a = -\omega ^2x_0 sin\omega t$$
- Hence, we can say $$a = -\omega ^2 x$$
- This is the defining equation for SHM and it shows that acceleration is directly proportional in magnitude but opposite in direction to displacement$$a \propto -d$$
- ==Simple harmonic motion is a to-and-fro motion in which the acceleration of an object is proportional to its displacement from a fixed equilibrium position, and acts in the opposite direction to its displacement==
- Rewriting equations for displacement and velocity,$$x = x_0 sin\omega t \Rightarrow\sin \omega t - \frac{x}{x_0}$$
$$v = \omega x_0 cos \omega t \Rightarrow cos\omega t \frac{v}{\omega x_0}$$
- Using $sin^2x + cos^2x = 1$,$$(\frac{x}{x_0})^2 + (\frac{v}{wx_0})^2 = 1$$
$$\omega ^2x^2 + v^2 = \omega^2x_0^2$$
$$v = \pm \omega \sqrt{x_0^2 - x^2}$$

- The vertical height of the displacement of the shadow can be found by using $x = -rcos\omega t$
>[!NOTE] 
>To prove something is in simple harmonic motion, show how the acceleration is directly proportional to displacement by differentiating it 2 times
## Dynamics of simple harmonic motion
- From newton's second law,$$F = ma = m\omega ^2 x$$
	- $F$: Force
	- $m$: mass
	- $a$ : Acceleration
	- $\omega$: Angular frequency
- For SHM, there must be a net force, called the restoring force, which is proportional to displacement and opposite in direction to displacement
- For example a mass spring system ![[dyanmics shm.png]]
- At all positions, net restoring force is $$F_{net} = -kx$$
## Energy of simple harmonic motion
- An object executing SHM interchanges its kinetic and potential energies
### Kinetic energy
- Equations involving displacement
	- $v = \pm\omega\sqrt{x_0^2 - x^2}$
	- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2(x_0^2 - x^2)$
	- $Max\ E_k = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x_0^2$
	- When x = 0, velocity is max at centre of oscillation
- Equations involving time
	- $v = \omega x_0 cos \omega t$
	- $E_k = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2 x_0^2 cos ^2 \omega t$
	- $Max\ E_k = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2 x_0^2$
	- When $cos \omega t = 1$, KE is max
### Total energy
- Equations involving displacement
	- Total energy = Max KE
	- $E_t = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x_0^2$
- Equations involving time
	- Total energy = Max KE
	- $E_t = \frac{1}{2}m\omega ^2 x_0^2$
### Potential energy
- Equations involving displacement
	- $E_P = E_t - E_K$
	- $E_p = \frac{1}{2}m^2x^2$
- Equations involving time
	- $E_P = E_t - E_K$
	- $E_p = \frac{1}{2}m^2x_0^2(1 - cos^2\omega t) = \frac{1}{2}m^2x_0^2sin^2\omega t$
### Graph
![[energy graphs shm.png]]
- Note that with time, there are two cycles of KE in 1 period
## Damping
- ==Damped oscillations are oscillations in which there is a continuous transfer of energy to the surrounding due to dissipative forces such that the energy in the system decreases with time, hence the amplitude of the motion progressively decreases with time==
- ==Damping is a process where energy is taken form an oscillating system because of dissipative forces==
### Light damping
- The amplitude of oscillations decreases (approximately exponentially) over a long time
- The period remains nearly the same as if the system is undamped
- Used in meters which need to show rapid fluctuations such as level meters in audio equipment
![[light damping.png]]
### Critical damping
- No oscillations occur
- The time taken for displacement to become zero is minimum (about $\frac{1}{4}$of a period )
- Used in meters which require the needle to not oscillate at the final reeding (Speedometers, voltmeter, ammeter), and car suspension systems
>[!NOTE]
>Car suspension systems ensure a comfortable ride for passengers when a car is moving on a bumpy road
>It uses shock absorbers or oil dampers, dissipating away the bounding motion in the shortest period of time, providing critical damping

![[critical damping.png]]
### Heavy damping
- No oscillations occur about the equilibrium position when the damping force increases beyond the point of critical damping
- The oscillator takes a longer time to return to the equilibrium position relative to the critically damped system
- Used in meters which are required to ignore transient changes (car fuel gauges), or large heavy doors which are heavily damped to prevent slamming
![[heavy damping.png]]
## Forced oscillation
- ==Forced oscillations are caused by continual input of energy by external source to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation==
- As damping causes energy to be lost, an external energy source is required in order to maintain oscillations at a constant amplitude
- The external source providing the energy is called the driving force
- The oscillator is called the driving system, which undergoes forced oscillation due to the driving force
### Resonance
- Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency which depends on the dimensions and nature of material
- ==Resonance is a phenomenon where a system responds with maximum amplitude to an external driving force==
- At resonance, there is maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system
- Resonance occurs when the driving frequency is approximately equivalent to the natural frequency
### Frequency-response graph
- The frequency response graph is a graph where the amplitude of oscillation is plotted against driving frequency
- As frequency increases, the amplitude increases
- The amplitude of oscillation is maximum at the resonant frequency (where driver frequency is equal to natural frequency)
- Afterwards, as frequency increases, the amplitude decreases
- As the degree of damping increases
	- The amplitude of the peak decreases
	- The peak becomes broader as it spreads over a wider range of frequencies
	- Resonance occurs at a frequency smaller than the natural frequency
- Theoretically, with no damping, the amplitude of oscillation should be of infinitely large magnitude at the resonant frequency
- This is because there is a continuous input of energy with no energy loss
- In practise, damping always exists and the final amplitude is reached when the rate of energy gained from the drivers source is equal to the rate of energy dissipation to the surroundings
