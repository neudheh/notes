- ==An oscillation is a periodic motion of an object about a certain mean equilibrium position, with a continuous interchange of kinetic energies and potential energies==
- ==Damped oscillations is when there is a continuous transfer of energy to the surrounding due to dissipative forces such as the energy in the system decreases with time, causing amplitude to decrease with time==
- ==Forced oscillations are caused by a continual input of energy by external sources to an oscillating system to compensate the loss due to damping, to maintain the amplitude of the oscillation==
- Periodic or harmonic motion refers to any motion that repeats itself in equal intervals of time
- Simple harmonic motion are motions that can be described by a single sinusoidal function
### Terms and definitions in SHM
![[oscillating spring.png]]
- ==Equilibrium position is the position at which no net force acts on the oscillating mass==
- ==Displacement is the distance of the oscillating mass from its equilibrium position at any instant in a stated direction==
- ==Amplitude is the maximum displacement from the oscillating mass from its equilibrium position==
- ==Period is the time taken for one complete oscillation==
- ==Frequency is the number of complete oscillations per unit time made by the oscillating object== $$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- Where $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
- Angular frequency is the product of frequency and $2\pi$$$\omega = 2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{T}$$
- Where $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rad s^{-1}$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
- Phase expresses which stage the oscillator is within a cycle of oscillation
- Phase describes the physical position and velocity of an oscillator
- It also describes where the osicllator is represented on a displacement-time graph, 
- It also describes the angle of the point (representing the oscillator) that moves around a reference circle
## Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration as a function of time
- If timing starts at the centre of the oscillation, $$x = x_0 \sin\omega t$$
- If timing starts at the maximum displacement,  $$x = x_0 \cos\omega t$$
- Where $x$: Displacement ($m$), $x_0$: Amplitude ($m$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rad s^{-1}$)
![[displacement velocity acceleration as a function of time shm.png]]
- Displacement, velocity, acceleration all vary sinusoidally with time
- Maximum velocity is attained when the oscillator is at equilibrium, and is given by $\omega x_0$
- Minimum velocity is attained when the oscillator is at the extreme positions, and is 0
- Maximum acceleration is attained when the oscillator is at the extreme ends, and is given by $\omega ^2 x_0$
- Minimum acceleration is attained when the osicllator is at equilibrium, and is 0
## Velocity and acceleration as a function of displacement
$$x =x_0 \sin \omega t, a = -\omega ^2 x_0 \sin \omega t$$
- Substituting, $$a = -\omega^2 x$$
- Thus, ==simple harmonic motion is a to-and-fro motion where acceleration of the object is proportion to its displacement from a fixed equilibrium position, and opposite in direction of displacement==
- Rewriting equations for displacement and velocity, $$ x= x_0 \sin \omega t \rightarrow \sin \omega t = \frac{x}{x_0}$$$$ v = x_0 \omega \cos \omega t \rightarrow \cos \omega t = \frac{v}{x_0 \omega}$$
- Using $sin^2 x + cos^2 x = 1$, $$(\frac{x}{x_0})^2 + (\frac{v}{x_0 \omega})^2 = 1$$$$\omega^2 x + v^2 = \omega ^2 x_0 ^2$$
- Therefore, velocity is given by $$v = \pm\omega\sqrt{x_0^2 - x^2}$$
- Where $x$: Displacement ($m$), $x_0$: Amplitude ($m$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rad s^{-1}$)

![[simple harmonic motion and circular motion.png]]
- The vertical height of the displacement of the shadow can be found by using $x = -rcos\omega t$
>[!NOTE] 
>To prove something is in simple harmonic motion, show how the acceleration is directly proportional to displacement by differentiating it 2 times
>
## Dynamics of simple harmonic motion
- Acceleration $a = -\omega^2 x$
- Therefore, $$F = ma = -m\omega^2x$$
- By newton's second law, there must be a net force for SHM
- This net force is proportional to displacement, and opposite in direction
- It is known as the restoring force, as it always directed towards the equilibrium position, opposite to displacement
- For example, a mass-spring system, ![[dyanmics shm.png]]
- Therefore, at all positions, the net restoring force, $F_{net} = -kx$
## Energy in SHM
- An object executing SHM interchanges its kinetic and potential energies
### Kinetic energy
$$v = \pm \omega\sqrt{x_0^2 + x^2}$$
$$E_K = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2(x_0^2 -x^2) = \frac{1}{2}m(\omega x_0\cos\omega t)^2$$
- For maximum $E_k$, $$E_{k\ max}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x_0^2$$
### Total energy
- Total energy is equal to the maximum $E_k$ $$E_{total}=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x_0^2$$
### Potential energy
- Potential energy $E_p = E_{Total} - E_{k}$
$$E_P = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2x^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(\omega x_0\sin\omega t)^2$$
![[energy graphs shm.png]]
- There are two cycles of $E_K$ in one period
## Damped oscillations
- In real life, due to dissipated forces like friction, air resistance, fluid resistance, etc
- As energy is used to overcome these force, the amplitude of the oscillations will decrease continuously over time
- ==Damping is a process whereby energy is taken form an oscillating system because of dissipative forces==
### Light damping
- The amplitude of the oscillations decreases exponentially over a long time
- For light damping, the period remains nearly the same if the system was undamped
- Meters which need to show rapid fluctuations (e.g. audio equipment)
![[light damping.png]]
### Critical damping
- No oscillations occur in critically damped motion
- The time taken for the displacement to become zero is a minimum
- Car suspension system, meters which require the needle to not oscillate at the final reading

>[!NOTE]
>Car suspension systems ensure a comfortable ride for passengers when a car is moving on a bumpy road
>It uses shock absorbers or oil dampers, dissipating away the bounding motion in the shortest period of time, providing critical damping
>

![[critical damping.png]]
### Heavy damping
- No oscillations occur about the equilibrium positon when the damping force increases beyond the point of critical damping
- The oscillator takes a longer time to return to the equilibrium position relative to the critically damped system
- Meters which are used to ignore transient changes, preventing doors from slamming
![[heavy damping.png]]
## Forced oscillations and resonance 
- As damping causes energy to be lost, and external energy source is needed to maintain oscillations at constant amplitude
- The external energy source providing the energy is called the driving force
- The oscillator is the driven system, which undergoes force oscillations due to the driving force
- Resonance is the phenomenon where a system responds with maximum amplitude to an external driving force
- At resonance, there is a maximum transfer of energy from the driving system to the driven system
- Any mechanical system that is free to move has a natural frequency depending on its dimensions and nature of material
- When a system is subjected to a driving force of frequency $f$, there is a transfer of energy and the system will undergo oscillations
- When the driving frequency is approximately equal to the natural frequency, the amplitude of the vibration of the system becomes a maximum, and there is resonance
### Frequency-response graph
![[Frequency response graph.png]]
- The amplitude of the oscillations of the oscillating system will increase to a maximum value at the resonant frequency, where the driver frequency equals natural frequency
- Thereafter, as driving frequency is increased further, the amplitude of oscillations of the driven system increases
- With no damping, the amplitude of oscillations should theoretically lead to an infinitely large magnitude at the resonant frequency
- This is because there is a continuous energy input without any energy losses
- In practise, damping always exists, and the final amplitude is reached when the rate of energy gained from the driving source is equal to the rate of energy dissipation to the surroundings
- As the degree of damping is increased, the amplitude of the peak decreases
- The peak becomes broader as it spreads over a wider range of frequencies, and the response is less sharp
- Resonance occurs at a frequency smaller than the natural frequency
