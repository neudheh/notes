## Magnetic field
- ==A magnetic field is a region of space in which a magnetic force is experienced by any moving charge or current-carrying conductor that is present in the field==
- It can be produced by permanent magnets, a moving charge or a current-carrying conductor
- It can be represented by magnetic field lines
- The closer the lines, the stronger the field
- If the lines are parallel and equally spaced, the magnetic field is uniform
- The arrows on the field lines give the direction in which the north-seeking end of the compass points
- The lines do not cross
![[magnetic field lines.png]]
![[dots and cross.png]]
- The strength of the field is given by magnetic flux density
- It has the unit of Tesla ($T$)
### Magnetic field of the earth
- The geographic north pole is a magnetic south pole, attracting the north pole of the compass; the geographic south pole is a magnetic north pole
- A compass placed at any point in the earth's magnetic field will point in the direction of the field line at the point
- In Britain, the earth's field is inclined downwards at an angle of about $70\degree$ to the horizontal, which is known as the angle of dip
- At the equator, the angle of dip is $0\degree$
### Long-straight conductor
- The magnetic filed forces concentric circles and the field lines will be more and more spaced out as distance form the conductor increases
![[long straight conductor.png]]
- Direction of the field line is given by the right hand grip rule, where the thumb is in the direction of the current and the magnetic field is in the direction of the other fingers
![[magnetic field of a long straight conductor.png]]
$$B=\frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$$
- $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: Permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
### Flat coil
- The field pattern is symmetrical about the axis of the coil
- Direction of the magnetic field at the centre can be found by the right hand grip rule
- The magnetic flux density at regions within the coil will be slightly different from the flux density at the centre of the coil
- At regions outside the coil, the field is weaker as the contributions from the current at different points of the coil partially cancel out to some extent
- The magnetic flux density at the centre is given by 
  $$B=\frac{\mu_0NI}{2r}$$
- $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: Permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $N$: Number of turns of the coil, $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
### Solenoid
- The magnetic field inside a solenoid is approximately uniform
- The direction can be determined using the right hand grip rule
- The field outside the solenoid is like that of a bar magnet, where the magnetic north pole at the end of the solenoid where the magnetic field lines are pointing outwards
- We can place a piece of magnetic material such as soft iron to increase the magnetic flux density
- When a current passes through the solenoid, the soft-iron core becomes magnetised, strengthening the magnetic field of the solenoid
![[solenoid.png]]
- The magnetic flux density is given by $$B=\mu_0nI$$
- $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: Permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $n$: Number of turns per unit length of the solenoid ($m^{-1}$) $I$: Current ($A$)
- The magnetic flux density at the centre is the strongest
- The magnetic field lines at the ends of the solenoid is half of that at the centre of the solenoid
### Hemholtz coil
- A Helmholtz coil produces a nearly uniform magnetic field between the coils when the current flows in the same direction
- It is made up of two coaxial parallel coils of equal radius $R$ separated by a distance $R$
- This space is more convenient to work with than that of a solenoid

## Forces on a current carrying conductor in a magnetic field
- A magnetic field exerts forces on a moving electrically charge particle
- The direction of the force is perpendicular to the current and the file and is given by Fleming's left hand rule
- A conductor will only experience a magnetic force when there is a magnetic field that makes an angle of $90\degree$ to the current
![[flemings left hand rule.png]]
>[!NOTE]
>Easy trick to remember Fleming's left hand rule
>- The current will kill you, so its rude and is the middle finger
>- The force is always the big boi, and thus the thumb
>- Through elimination, the magnetic field is the index finger

![[force on a conductor.png]]
- The force on a conductor is given by $$F=BIL\sin\theta$$
- $F$: Magnetic force ($N$), $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $I$: Current ($A$), $L$: Length ($m$), $\theta$: angle between magnetic field and conductor ($rad$)
- If the conductor is parallel to the filed, it will experience no force
## Magnetic flux density
- ==Magnetic flux density is the force acting per unit current and per unit length on a conducting wire placed at right angles to the direction of the magnetic field==
- Unit of Tesla ($T$)
### Current balance
![[current balance.png]]
- The wire AD in the set up will experience a downward magnetic force $F$ as the current flowing through it $I$ is perpendicular to the magnetic field $B$
- By placing a rider of weight $mg$ at a distance $y$ form BC, rotational equilibrium can be achieved
- Since it is at equilibrium, anti-clockwise moment about $BC$ = clockwise moment about BC
- $BIL\sin(90)\times x=mg\times y\rightarrow B=\frac{mgy}{ILx}$  
- Hence, we can determine the magnetic flux density $B$
## Forces on 2 parallel current-carrying conductors
### Same direction
- Wire 1 of length $L$ carrying current $I_1$ generates a magnetic field $B_1$ at the position of wire 2 that is going into the page
- When $I_2$ flows through wire 2 in the same direction of $I_1$, wire 2 experiences a magnetic force $F_2$ to the left towards wire 1 (from Fleming's left hand rule)
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in the same direction 1.png]]
- Similarly, wire 2 of length $L$ carrying current $I_2$ generates a magnetic field $B_2$ at the position of wire 1 that is going out of the page
- From Fleming's left hand rule, wire 1 experiences a force $F_1$ to the right towards wire 2
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in the same direction 2.png]]
- Hence, two parallel conductors flowing in the same direction produce attractive forces on each other
### Opposite direction
- The mutual interaction of magnetic fields generated by two wires carrying currents in opposite direction produces repulsive forces
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in opposite direction.png]]
- The forces acting on each wire form an action-reaction pair
- Since $F_1=B_2I_1L=\frac{\mu_0I_2}{2\pi d}I_1L$, and $F_2=B_1I_2L=\frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}I_2L$, $F\propto\frac{I_1I_2}{d}$
- The force is directly proportional to the product of their currents, and inversely proportional to their separation $d$
## Forces on moving charges
- For a positively charged particle, the direction of motion follows conventional current flow, and the direction of the force can be found by Fleming's left hand rule
![[forces on a moving positively charged particle.png]]
- For a negatively charged particle, the direction of motion is opposite to conventional current, but we can still use Fleming's left hand rule
![[forces on a moving negatively charged particle.png]]
- The force experience by a charged particle can be found by 
  $$F=BQv\sin\theta$$
- $F$: Magnetic force ($N$), $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $\theta$: Angle between magnetic field and current ($rad$)
### Circular motion
![[circular motion of a moving charged particle inside of a magnetic field.png]]
- Magnetic force $F$ is a deflecting force, that is not in the direction of the field unlike gravitational and electric forces
- Magnetic force that acts perpendicular to the field provides a centripetal force which causes the charged particle to follow a circular path
- As $F$ is perpendicular to $v$, $F$ does no work on the charged particle and there si no change in speed, only a change in direction
- No energy is added to the particle
![[path travelled by different particles in a magnetic field.png]]
- As the magnetic force provides the centripetal force causing the circular motion, $F_B=F_C\rightarrow BQv\sin\theta=\frac{m(v\sin\theta)^2}{r}$
- When $\theta=90\degree$, $BQv=\frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow r=\frac{mv}{BQ}$
- If one quantity is unknown, we can calculate it form the other four quantities
- $\omega=\frac{v}{r}=\frac{BQ}{m}$
- $T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{2\pi m}{BQ}$
- $F=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{BQ}{2\pi m}$
- Frequency and hence period, does not depend on the speed of the charged particle
### Deflection in electric and magnetic fields
![[deflection of particles in an electric field.png]]
- In a uniform electric field, when a charged particle is projected horizontally, perpendicular to the direction of the electric field, it will experience an electric force
- This will cause it to be deflected and it will take a parabolic path
- Consider a beam of charged particles passing through a region with perpendicular crossing electric fields and magnetic fields
- The particle will experience both an electric force and a magnetic force
- The electric force ($F=QE$) is constant as the charge of the particles is constant and the electric field $E$ is uniform
- The magnetic force ($F=BQv$) varies with the velocity of the charged particles
- Slower particles will experience a smaller magnetic force; and faster particles experience a larger magnetic force
![[velocity selector.png]]
- When the particle is travelling slowly, the electric force will be greater than the magnetic force, causing it to be deflected upwards and follow path A
- When the particle is travelling quickly, the magnetic force will be greater than the electric force, causing it to be deflected downwards and follow path C
- When the magnetic force and electric force have the same magnitude, the particle will travel in a straight path undeflected
### Velocity selector

- A velocity selector is device that uses crossed magnetic and electric fields to select a beam of charged particles of a desired velocity
- Consider a bunch of charged particles with a range of speeds, which is passed into a region where uniform electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other
- Particles of a particular speed $V$ can be made to pass through undeflected trough the slit of the collimator plate by adjusting the value of $\frac{E}{B}$
- Particles moving with a slower or higher speed than $V$ will be deflected and get blocked by collimator plate 
$$F_E = F_B$$$$qE = Bqv$$$$v = \frac{E}{B}$$
- By varying the relative magnitudes of E and B between the plates until the beam travels straight through, we can select a fixed velocity of $v$ of the emerging beam
