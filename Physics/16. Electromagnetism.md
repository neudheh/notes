## Magnetic field
- ==A magnetic field is the region of space in which a magnetic force is experienced by any moving charge or any current-carrying conductor that is present in the field==
- Magnetic fields can be produced by permanent magnets, moving charges, or a current-carrying conductor
### Magnetic field lines
- A magnetic field can be represented by its magnetic field lines
- If the lines are parallel and equally spaced, the field is uniform
- Else, it will vary in strength from one point to another
- The field is strongest where the lines are closest together
- The direction of the resultant field strength at any point is given by the tangent to the field line at that point
- The arrows on the field give the direction in which the north-seeking end of the compass points
- The field lines do not cross each other
![[magnetic field lines.png]]
- The field can also be represented by a series of crosses and dots
![[dots and cross.png]]
### Magnetic field of the earth
- The geographic north pole is actually a magnetic south pole, which attracts the north pole of the compass
- The geographic south pole is actually a magnetic north pole
- A compass placed at any point in the earth's magnetic field will point in the direction of the field line at that point
- In Britain, the Earth's field is inclined downwards at an angle of $70\degree$ to to the horizontal, causing a compass to dip $70\degree$ below the horizontal
- This is known the angle of dip
- The angle of dip is zero at the magnetic equator
- The magnitude of earth's magnetic field varies with location
## Magnetic field strength
- Magnetic field strength is a vector quantity
- Magnetic field strength at a point is also known as the magnetic flux density
- It has the unit Tesla ($T$)
## Magnetic field due to a current-carrying conductor
### Long straight conductor
- The magnetic field set up by a straight current carrying conductor takes the form of concentric circles
- The field lines will be more and more spaced out as the distance from the conductor increases
![[long straight conductor.png]]
- The direction of the field lines relative to the current can be determined by the right hand grip rule
- Grasp the conductor with your right hand, with your thumb pointing in the direction of the current, and the curled fingers will point in the direction of the field
![[magnetic field of a long straight conductor.png]]
- The expression for the magnetic flux density is given by $$B = \frac{\mu_0I}{2\pi r}$$
- Where $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
### Flat coil
- By symmetry, the field pattern is symmetrical about the axis of the coil
- Direction of the magnetic field at the centre of the coil can be determined using the right hand grip rule
- The magnetic flux density at regions within the coil will be slightly different from the flux density at the centre of the coil
- At regions outside of the coil, the field is weaker than regions inside the coil, as the contributions from the current at different points of the coil partially cancel out
- Regions pointing in the same direction will reinforce each other and form a stronger field
- Regions with lines in opposite direction will form a weaker field
![[magnetic field due to a flat coil.png]]
- The magnetic flux density at the centre of the coil is given by $$B = \frac{\mu_0NI}{2r}$$
- Where $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $N$: Number of turns, $I$: Current ($A$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
### Solenoid
- The magnetic field inside of the solenoid is approximately uniform
- The direction of the magnetic field can be determined by right hand grip rule
- The magnetic field outside of the solenoid is like that of a bar magnet with its magnetic north pole at the end of the solenoid, where the magnetic field lines are pointing outwards
- The magnetic field at the centre of the solenoid is the strongest
- It varies proportionally with current, and the number of turns per unit length of the solenoid
- The magnetic field strength at the ends of the solenoid is half that of the centre of the solenoid
![[solenoid.png]]
- The magnetic field inside the solenoid near its centre is very uniform and parallel to the axis
- The magnetic flux density in the central region of the solenoid core is given by $$B = \mu_0nI$$
- Where $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $\mu_0$: permeability of free space ($4\pi\times10^{-7}Hm^{-1}$), $n$: Number of turns per unit length of the solenoid ($\frac{N}{L}$), $I$: Current ($A$)
- At then ends, the magnetic field strength is given by $$B = \frac{1}{2}\mu_0nI$$
### Generation of a uniform magnetic field
- A Helmholtz coil is a device for producing a region of nearly uniform magnetic field
- It is made up of coaxial parallel coils of equal radius $R$, sperated by distance $R$
- When the current in the coils flow in the same direction, a region with nearly uniform magnetic field is set up midway between the coils
- This uniform magnetic field set up would be a more convenient space to work with compared to one of a solenoid

## Force on a current-carrying conductor in a magnetic field
### Fleming's left-hand rule
- A magnetic field exerts forces on moving electrically charged particles
- The direction of the force $F$ acting on the current-carrying conductor is perpendicular to both the current and the field, and is given by Fleming's left hand rule
![[flemings left hand rule.png]]
>[!NOTE]
>Easy trick to remember Fleming's left hand rule
>- The current will kill you, so its rude and is the middle finger
>- The force is always the big boi, and thus the thumb
>- Through elimination, the magnetic field is the index finger

- Magnetic force is always perpendicular to the magnetic field and current
- A conductor will only experience a magnetic force when there is a magnetic field that makes an angle of $90\degree$ to the current
### Factors affecting the force on a conductor
- Consider a straight conductor carrying current placed at an angle between the magnetic field
![[force on a conductor.png]]
$$F =B_\perp IL = BIL\sin\theta$$
- Where $F$: Magnetic force ($N$), $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $I$: Current ($A$), $L$: Length of the conductor, $\theta$: angle between the direction of current flow and magnetic field strength ($rad$)
- If the conductor is parallel to the direction of the field, it experiences no force
## Magnetic flux density
- ==Magnetic flux density is the force acting per unit current and per unit length on a conducing wire placed at right angles (perpendicular) to the direction of the magnetic field==$$B=\frac{F}{IL}$$
- Where $B$: Magnetic flux density ($T$), $F$: Magnetic force ($N$), $I$: Current ($A$), $L$: Length of the conductor
### Current balance
![[current balance.png]]
- The wire AD in the setup will experience a downward magnetic force $F$ as the current flowing through it is perpendicular to the magnetic field strength $B$
- By placing a rider of weight $mg$ at a distance $y$ from BC, rotational equilibrium can be achieved when the plane of loop ABCD is horizontal
- At equilibrium, anti-clockwise moment due for force F = clockwise moment due to weight $mg$ of rider $$F_m\times x =mg\times y$$$$BIL\sin90\degree\times x = mg\times y$$$$B = \frac{mgy}{ILx}$$
- Hence the strength of the magnetic field, or magnetic flux density can be determined
## Forces between 2 parallel current-carrying conductors
### Same direction
- Wire 1 and wire 2 are carrying current flowing in the same direction
**Forces on wire 2**
- Wire 1 of length $L$ carrying current $I_1$ generates a magnetic field $B_1$ at the position of wire 2
- When $I_2$ flows through wire 2 in the same direction as $I_1$, wire 2 experiences a force $F_2$
- Using Fleming's left hand rule, wire 2 experiences a force $F_2$ towards wire 1
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in the same direction 1.png]]
**Forces on wire 1**
- Similarly, wire 2 carrying current $I_2$ generates a magnetic field $B_2$ at the position of wire 1
- By Fleming's left hand rule, wire 1 experiences a force $F_1$ towards wire 2
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in the same direction 2.png]]
- Hence, parallel conductors carrying current in the same direction produces attractive forces exerted on each wire
### Opposite direction
- Conductors carrying current in opposite directions produce repulsive forces on each other
![[2 parallel current carrying conductors in opposite direction.png]]
- The forces acting on each wire are action-reaction forces
$$F_1 = B_2I_1L_1 = \frac{\mu_0I_2}{2\pi d}I_1L, _1, F_2 =  B_1I_2L_2 = \frac{\mu_0I_1}{2\pi d}I_2L$$

- The magnitude of the force of interaction varies proportionately to the product of the two currents, and inversely as their separation $d$ $$F \propto \frac{I_1I_2}{d}$$
## Forces on moving charges
### Moving charges in a uniform filed
- For a positively charged particle, the direction of motion is the same as conventional current flow
- The direction of the force on the positively charged particle can be found by using Fleming's left hand rule
![[forces on a moving positively charged particle.png]]
- For a negatively charged particle, the direction of motion is opposite to conventional current flow
- The direction of the force on the negatively charged particle can be found using Fleming's left hand rule, with the middle finger in the opposite to the direction of motion
 ![[forces on a moving negatively charged particle.png]]
 - The force experienced by the charged particles is given by $$F = B_\perp Qv = (B\sin\theta)Qv = BQv\sin\theta$$
 - Where $F$: Magnetic force ($N$), $B$: magnetic flux density ($T$), $Q$: Charge of the particle ($C$) , $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $\theta$: Angle between the magnetic field and the velocity ($rad$)
### Circular motion of moving charged particles in magnetic fields
- Consider a particle of charge $e$ moving with velocity $v$ in a magnetic field of strength $B$, which is going into the paper
![[circular motion of a moving charged particle inside of a magnetic field.png]]
- Magnetic force $F_B$ is a deflecting force, which is not in the direction of the field
- Magnetic force acts perpendicular to the field, and provides a centripetal force, causing the particle to follow a circular path
- As $F_B$ is perpendicular to $v$, no work is done, and there is no change in speed
- There is only a change in direction, and no energy is added to the particle
- Gravitational effects are neglected
![[path travelled by different particles in a magnetic field.png]]
- Consider a particle of mass $m$ and charge $q$ entering a magnetic field such that its velocity $v$ is perpendicular to the magnetic field $B$
- The particle can curve either towards the left or the right, indicated that their charges are of opposite sign
- The magnetic force acting on the particle provides the centripetal force causing the circular motion
- Hence, centripetal force = magnetic force $$\frac{m(v\sin\theta)^2}{r}= Bqv\sin\theta$$
- Taking the case of $v\perp B$, hence $\theta = 90\degree$, $$\frac{mv^2}{r}=Bqv$$
$$r = \frac{mv}{Bq}$$
- Hence, if only one quantity is unknown, it can be calculated from the four other unknown quantities
- Frequency, and hence period does not depend on the speed of the particle
### Deflection in electric and magnetic fields
- In a uniform electric field, when a charge particle is projected horizontally, perpendicularly to the direction of the field, the particle will experience an electric force
- This will cause the particle to be deflected and undergo a parabolic path
![[deflection of particles in an electric field.png]]
- Consider a beam of charge particles passing through a region where E fields and B fields are crossed perpendicularly to each other
- The charged particles will experience an electric force ($F_E = qE$), and the magnetic force ($F_B = Bqv$)
- The electric force stays constant as the charge of particles $q$ is constant and electric field $E$ is uniform
- Since $F_B = BqV$, where magnetic field strength $B$ and the charge of particles $q$ are constant, the magnetic force varies with the velocity of the charged particles ($F_b\propto v$)
- Thus, slower particles will experience a smaller magnetic force, and faster particles experience a larger magnetic force
- The imbalance of electric and magnetic force causes slower and faster particles to be deflected in opposite directions
![[velocity selector.png]]
- When the electric force exerted on the beam of charged particles is larger than the magnetic force exerted on the particles, the speed of the particle is slow
- The charged particles will be deflected upwards, in the direction of the resultant force, following path A
- When the electric force exerted on the beam of charged particles is equal to the magnetic force exerted on the particles, the particles will travel in a straight path undeflected, following path B
- When the electric force exerted on the beam of charged particles is smaller than the magnetic force exerted on the particles, the speed of the particle is fast
- The charge particles will be deflected downwards, in the direction of the resultant force, following path C
### Velocity selector
- A velocity selector is device that uses crossed magnetic and electric fields to select a beam of charged particles of a desired velocity
- Consider a bunch of charged particles with a range of speeds, which is passed into a region where uniform electric and magnetic fields are perpendicular to each other
- Particles of a particular speed $V$ can be made to pass through undeflected trough the slit of the collimator plate by adjusting the value of $\frac{E}{B}$
- Particles moving with a slower or higher speed than $V$ will be deflected and get blocked by collimator plate 
$$F_E = F_B$$$$qE = Bqv$$$$v = \frac{E}{B}$$
- By varying the relative magnitudes of E and B between the plates until the beam travels straight through, we can select a fixed velocity of $v$ of the emerging beam
