- ==Temperature is a measure of thermal energy/ internal kinetic energy of an atom==
- Thermal energy is always transferred form a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature
- ==The energy transferred in this process is known as heat==
- When two objects with different temperatures are placed in thermal contact, there will be a net energy transfer from the hotter object to the colder object
- As heat is transferred, the temperatures of the objects will change until they have the same temperature
- ==At this point, there is a not be a net flow of energy from each other, and we call this thermal equilibrium==
## Temperature scale
- We can use thermometers to measure temperatures
- When object A is in thermal equilibrium with a thermometer and object B is in thermal equilibrium with the same the same thermometer, when they are placed together they will be in thermal equilibrium
- Thus, objects A and B are at the same temperature
- All temperature scales are based on arbitrarily chosen reference temperatures for calibration
### Empirical scale
- Suppose we take the liquid level of a thermometer at the temperature of pure freezing water to be 0, and the level of the same thermometer in pure boiling water to be 100
- We then divide the distance between these two into 100 equal intervals, called degrees
- Thus, we can get the centigrade temperature scale
- We can interpolate between these reference temperatures, or extrapolate beyond them
- But, when calibrating a thermometer, the expansion properties of liquid may not be linear and the calibrated temperatures may not reflect the true temperature of a system
- Different thermometric properties vary in different ways to temperature changes
- Two thermometer that use different properties may give out different readings for the same temperature
### Absolute scale
- An absolute scale is independent of the thermometric properties of any substance and has an absolute zero
- As pressure increases linearly with temperature, when volume is kept constant, a constant volume gas thermometer can be used for temperature calibration
![[absolute scale.png]]
- By extrapolating this graph leftwards, we can see that there is a theoretical temperature at which the gas pressure becomes zero ($-273.15\degree C$)
- This temperature is called the absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which all molecular motion ceases
- We can use this as the basis for the Kelvin temperature scale
- For convenience, the interval of one kelvin is equal to the interval of one degree celsius $$T/K = T/\degree C + 273.16$$
- Where $T/K$: Temperature ($K$), $T/\degree C$: Temperature ($\degree C$)
## Ideal gas equation
- Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas model
- Real gasses behave like ideal gasses when pressure is low and temperature is high $$pV =nRT$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $n$: number of moles of the gas ($mol$), $R$: molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$)
- It is made up of three laws
- Boyle's law, $p \propto \frac{1}{V}$, where pressure decreases if volume increases, with temperature constant
- Charles's law, $V \propto T$, where volume increases if temperature increases, with pressure constant
- Pressure law, $P \propto T$, where pressure increases if temperature increases, with volume constant
- Other forms include $$pV = \frac{M}{M_m}RT$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $M$: Mass of the gas ($Kg$), $M_M$: Molar mass of the gas ($Kg$), $R$: molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$) 
$$pV = \frac{N}{N_A}RT$$$$pV = \frac{R}{N_A}NT$$$$pV = Nkt$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $N$: Number of molecules of gas, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$) , T: Temperature ($K$)
## Kinetic theory of gasses
- There are 4 basic assumptions (**DAVE**)
	- **D**uration of a collision is negligible compared to the time spent travelling between collisions
	- **A**ttractive forces among molecules are negligible so that they do not exert forces on each other except when they collide
	- **V**olume of the atoms or molecules is negligible compared with the volume occupied by the gas
	- **E**lastic collisions between the molecules and the wall of the container, so they bounce off the container and off each other without losing any kinetic energy
- Consider the motion of one molecule with mass $m$ at velocity $u$ perpendicular to the wall of the cube
![[kinetic energy of a gas.png]]
- Assuming collisions are elastic, 
	- Initial momentum before collision: $\rho = mu$
	- Final momentum after collision: $\rho = mu$
	- Change in momentum: $\Delta\rho = -2mu$
- Assuming the duration of the collision is negligible and the size of the molecule is negligible
	- Time between consecutive collisions on the same wall: $t=\frac{2L}{u}$
- By newton's second law, the force exerted by the wall on the molecule is equal to the rate of change of momentum of the molecule, $\frac{-2mu}{\frac{2L}{u}} = \frac{mu^2}{L}$
- By newton's third law, the force exerted by the molecule on the wall is $\frac{mu^2}{L}$
- Assuming no intermolecular forces,
	- As the molecules travel with different speeds, if there are $N$ molecules in the container, total force is given by $F = \frac{m(u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2+... u_N^2)}{L} = \frac{mN<u^2>}{L}$
	- $<u^2>=\frac{((u_1^2+u_2^2+u_3^2+... u_N^2)}{N}$ = mean square speed
- As pressure is the force per unit area, $p = \frac{mN<u^2>}{L\times L^2} = \frac{Nm}{V}<u^2>$
- In the container, there are molecules moving in the x, y, and z directions with velocities $u$, $v$, and $w$ respectively
	- By Pythagoras Theorem, $c^2 = c_x^2 + c_y^2 + c_x^2= u^2+ v^2+w^2$
	- By taking averages, $<c^2> = <u^2> + <v^2> + <w^2>$
	- Because the motion is completely random and the number of molecules is very large, $<u^2> = <v^2> = <w^2>$
	- Hence, $<c^2> = 3<u^2>$
- Hence, $$pV = \frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume of the gas, $N$: Number of molecules, $m$: Mass of one molecule ($kg$), $<c^2>$: mean square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
- Other forms include $$p = \frac{1}{3}\frac{M}{V}<c^2>$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$),  $M$: Mass of the gas ($kg$), $V$: Volume of the gas, $<c^2>$: mean square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
$$p = \frac{1}{3}\rho<c^2>$$
- Where $p$: Pressure ($Pa$),  $\rho$: Density ($kgm^{-3}$),  $<c^2>$: mean square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
### Kinetic energy
$$pV= \frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$$$pV =\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$
- As $pV = nRT$, $$nRT=\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$$$\frac{3}{2}\frac{n}{N}RT = \frac{1}{2}m<c^2>$$$$\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> = \frac{R}{N_a}T$$$$\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> = \frac{3}{2}kt$$
- Hence, $$E_K = \frac{3}{2}kT$$
- Where $E_K$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$),  $T$: Temperature ($K$)
- This is for one gas molecule only
- Total mean translational kinetic energy of $N$ is $$E_K = \frac{3}{2}NkT = \frac{3}{2}nRT$$
- Where $E_K$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $N$: Number of molecules, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$),  $T$: Temperature ($K$), $n$: Number of mol of molecules ($mol$),  $R$: molar gas constant ($8.31 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$) 
- Therefore, the total mean kinetic energy of an ideal gas molecule is proportional to its temperature $$E_K \propto T$$
### Root-mean square speed
- It gives an "average" speed of the gas molecules
$$Root\ mean-squared\ speed = C_{rms} = \sqrt{c^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + ... + u_N^2)}{N}}$$
## Kinetic particle theory
### Solids
- For a solid, very strong intermolecular forces bound the atoms/ molecules to a rigid structure called a lattice
- As such, they only have vibrational motion about their mean lattice points
- Internal energy is the sum of vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Liquids
- For a liquid, the intermolecular forces are weaker
- Molecules are held together in loose clusters
- They can move from cluster to cluster while interacting with others
- Internal energy comprises of translational and vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Gas
- For a gas, the intermolecular forces are very weak
- The molecules move freely and independently
- Internal energy comprises of mainly translational kinetic energy and almost negligible potential energy (except when under high pressure) 
## Specific heat capacity
- ==The specific heat capacity of a substance is the heat energy required to cause the per unit temperature rise of the substance==
$$Q = mc\Delta \theta$$
- Where $Q$: energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$: mass of the object ($kg$), $c$ : specific heat capacity of the object ($J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$) , $\Delta \theta$: change in temperature ($ÂºC/ K$)
## Specific latent heat of fusion/ vaporisation
- ==The specific latent heat of fusion of a substance is the amount of heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from solid to liquid state without a change in temperature== $$Q =ml_f$$
- Where: $Q$: energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$: mass of the object ($kg$), $l_f$: specific latent heat of fusion ($J kg^{-1}$)
- ==The specific latent heat of vaporisation of a substance is the amount of heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from liquid to gaseous state without a change in temperature== $$Q = ml_v$$
- Where: $Q$: energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$: mass of the object ($kg$), $l_v$: specific latent heat of vaporisation ($J kg^{-1}$)
- During a phase change, (change of state from solid to liquid), the heat supplied is used to increase the molecular potential energy of the atoms
- As average kinetic energy is constant, the temperature remains constant
