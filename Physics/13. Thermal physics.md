## Temperature
- Temperature is a measure of thermal energy
- Thermal energy is transferred from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature
- The energy transferred in this process is known as heat
- When two different objects with different temperatures are placed in thermal contact, there will be a net energy transfer from the hotter object to the colder object
- As heat is transferred, the temperatures of the objects will change until they have attained the same temperature
- At this point, there will be no net flow of thermal energy, and they are both at thermal equilibrium
- Thermal equilibrium is defined as the absence of heat transfer
## Temperature scale
### Empirical scale
- All empirical temperature scales are based on arbitrarily chosen references temperatures for calibration
- We can label a thermometer's liquid level and in freezing water and boiling water 0 and 100 respectively
- We can then divide the distance between these 2 points into 100 equal intervals called degrees, getting the centigrade temperature scale
- We can interpolate between 0 and 100, or extrapolate between them
- But, when calibrating a thermometer, the expansion properties of liquid may not be linear, and the calibrated temperature may not reflect the true temperature
- Thermometric properties vary in different ways, two thermometers that use different properties may give different readings for the same temperature
### Absolute scale
- An absolute temperature scale is independent of the thermometric properties of any particular substance and has an absolute zero
- Applying the pressure law, where pressure increases linearly with temperature, a constant gas volume thermometer can be used for temperature calibration
![[absolute scale.png]]
- By extrapolating the graph leftwards, there is a theoretical temperature at which the gas pressure would become zero, known as absolute zero
- This is the coldest possible temperature, at which all molecular motion ceases
- We use this as the basis for the Kelvin temperature scale
- For convenience, the interval of one Kelvin matches the interval of one degree centigrade 
  $$T/K = T/\degree C +273.15$$
- $T/K$: Temperature in Kelvin ($K$), $T/\degree C$: Temperature in Celsius ($\degree C$)
## Ideal gas
- Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas model
- Real gasses behave like an ideal gas when pressures are low and temperatures are high
- It is characterized by 3 state variables; pressure, volume and temperature
  $$pV = nRT$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $n$: Number of moles ($mol$), $R$: Molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$)
### Other forms of the equation
$$pV=(\frac{M}{M_m})RT$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $M$: Mass of the gas ($kg$), $M_m$: Molar mass ($kg$), $R$: Molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$)
$$pV = NkT$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $N$: number of molecules of the gas, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($1.38\times10^{-23}JK^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$)
## Kinetic theory of gasses
- Four basic assumptions (**DAVE**)
	- **D**uration of a collision is negligible compared to time spent travelling between collisions
	- **A**ttractive forces among molecules is negligible so they do not exert forces on each other except when they collide
	- **V**olume of the atoms and molecules is negligible compared to the volume occupied by the gas
	- **E**lastic collisions between the molecules and the walls of the container, so they bounce off the container and off each other without losing any kinetic energy
---
- Consider a molecule with mass $m$ moving with velocity $u_i$ perpendicular to the wall of a cube
![[kinetic energy of a gas.png]]
- Since collisions are elastic,
	- Initial momentum of a molecule before collision $p_i=mu$
	- Final momentum of a molecule after collision $p_f=-mu$
	- Change in momentum $\Delta p=-2mu$
- Since the time of collision is negligible,
	- Time between collisions on the same wall $t=\frac{2L}{u}$
	- By Newton's second law, the force by the wall on the molecule  $\frac{-2mu}{\frac{2L}{u}}=\frac{-mu^2}{L}$
	- By Newton's third law, the force exerted by the molecule on the wall $\frac{-mu^2}{L}$
- The molecules travel with different speeds
- If there are $N$ molecules in the container, then the total force is $F=\frac{m(u_1^2u_2^2+...+u_N^2)}{L}=\frac{mN<u^2>}{L}$, where mean square speed $<u^2>=\frac{u_1^2u_2^2+...+u_N^2}{N}$
- Since pressure is force per unit area, $P=\frac{mN}{V}<u^2>$
- The molecules are moving in the x, y, and z directions with velocities u, v and w respectively
- By Pythagoras theorem, $c^2=u^2+v^2+w^2$
- Taking average values, $<c^2>=<u^2>+<v^2>+<w^2>$
- Since the motion is completely random,$<u^2>=<v^2>=<w^2>$, hence $c=3<u^2>$
- Hence, 
  $$pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $V$: Volume($m^3$), $N$: Number of molecules, $m$: Mass of one molecule ($kg$), $<c^2>$: Mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
---
### Other forms of the equation
$$p=\frac{1}{3}\frac{M}{V}<c^2>$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $M$: Mass of the gas ($kg$), $V$: Volume($m^3$), $<c^2>$: Mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
$$p=\frac{1}{3}\rho <c^2>$$
- $p$: Pressure ($Pa$),$\rho$: Density ($kgm^{-3}$), $<c^2>$: Mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
### Kinetic energy of a gas
$$pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$
$$pV=\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$
- From the ideal gas equation, $pV=nRT$,
  $$pV=NkT$$
$$NkT=\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$
$$\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>=\frac{3}{2}kT$$
- Hence, the kinetic energy of one molecule is 
  $$E_K = \frac{3}{2}kT$$
- The mean translational kinetic energy is 
  $$E_K = \frac{3}{2}NkT=\frac{3}{2}nRT$$
- $E_k$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $N$: number of molecules of the gas, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($1.38\times10^{-23}JK^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$), $n$: Number of moles ($mol$), $R$: Molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$)
- Therefore, the total mean kinetic energy of an ideal gas is proportional to temperature $$E_K\propto T$$
- The root mean square speed give a representative and useful average speed of the gas molecules 
  $$c_{rms} = \sqrt{<c^2>}=\sqrt{\frac{c_1^2c_2^2+...+c_N^2}{N}}$$
  
## Kinetic particle theory
### Solids
- Very strong intermolecular forces bound the atoms/ molecules to a rigid structure called a lattice
- They only have vibrational motion about their mean lattice points
- Internal energy is the sum of vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Liquids
- Weaker intermolecular forces
- Molecules are held in loose clusters
- They can move from cluster to cluster while interacting with others
- Internal energy is the sum of translational and vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Gas
- Very weak intermolecular forces
- Molecules move freely and independently
- Internal energy is the sum of mainly translational kinetic energy and almost negligible potential energy (except when under high pressure)
## Specific heat capacity\
- ==Specific heat capacity of a substance is the heat energy needed to cause a per unit temperature rise of the substance==
  $$Q=mc\Delta\theta$$
- $Q$: Energy absorbed/ given out ($J$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $c$: Specific heat capacity ($Jkg^{-1}K^{-1}$), $\Delta\theta$: Change in temperature ($K/\degree C$)
## Specific latent heat of fusion/ vaporization
- ==Specific latent heat of fusion is the heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from a solid to liquid state without a change in temperature==
  $$Q=ml_f$$
- $Q$: Energy absorbed/ given out ($J$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $l_f$: Specific latent heat of fusion ($J^{-1}Kg^{-1}$)
- ==Specific latent heat of vaporization is the heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from a solid to liquid state without a change in temperature==
  $$Q=ml_v$$
- $Q$: Energy absorbed/ given out ($J$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $l_v$: Specific latent heat of vaporization ($J^{-1}Kg^{-1}$)
- During a phase change, the heat supplied is used to increase the molecular potential energy of atoms
- As the average kinetic energy is constant, the temperature remains constant
