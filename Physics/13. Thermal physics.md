## Temperature, heat, and thermal equilibrium
- ==Temperature is a measure of thermal energy/ internal kinetic energy of an atom==
- Thermal energy is always transferred from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature
- Thermal energy is always transferred from a region of higher temperature to a region of lower temperature
- ==The energy transferred is known as heat==
- When two objects with different temperatures are placed in thermal contact, there will be a net energy transfer from the hotter object to the colder object
- As heat is transferred, the temperature of the objects will change until they are the same temperature
- ==At this point, there will not be a net flow (transfer) of thermal energy between them, and we call this thermal equilibrium==
## Temperature scale
- All temperature scales are based on arbitrarily chosen reference temperatures for calibration
### Empirical scale
- Suppose we take the liquid level of a thermometer at the temperature of pure freezing water to be 0, and the level of the same thermometer in pure boiling water to be 100
- We then divide the distance between these two into 100 equal intervals, called degrees
- Thus, we get the centigrade temperature scale
- We interpolate between these reference temperatures, or extrapolate beyond them
- But, when calibrating a thermometer, the expansion properties of liquid may not be linear and the calibrated temperatures may not reflect the true temperature of a system
- Different thermometric properties vary in different ways to temperature changes
- Two thermometers that use different properties may give different readings for the same temperature
### Absolute scale
- An absolute scale is independent of the thermometric properties of any particular substance and has an absolute zero
- As pressure increases linearly with temperature, when volume is kept constant, a constant volume gas thermometer can be used for temperature calibration

- By extrapolating this graph leftwards, we see that there is a theoretical temperature at which the gas pressure would become zero, -273.15ºC)
- This temperature is called the absolute zero, the coldest possible temperature at which all molecular motion ceases
- We use this as the basis for the Kelvin temperature scale
- For convenience, the interval of one kelvin is equal to the interval of one degree celsius
$$T/K = T/\degree C + 273.15$$
- Where $T/K$ = Temperature ($K$), $T/\degree C$ = Temperature($\degree C$)
## Ideal gas equation
- Ideal gas is a hypothetical gas model
- Real gasses behave like ideal gasses when pressure is low and temperature is high
$$pV = nRT$$
- Where $p$ = Pressure ($Pa$), $V$ = volume of the gas, $n$ = Number of moles of the gas ($mol$), $R$ = molar gas constant ($8.31 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$) , T = temperature ($K$)
- It is made up of three laws
	- Boyle's law, $p \propto \frac{1}{V}$, where pressure decreases if volume increases, if temperature is constant
	- Charles's law, $V \propto T$, where volume increases if temperature increases, if pressure is constant
	- Pressure law, $P \propto T$ , where pressure increases if temperature increases, if volume is constant
- Other forms include
$$pV = \frac{M}{M_m}RT$$
- Where $p$ = Pressure ($Pa$), $V$ = volume of the gas, $M$ = mass of the gas, $M_m$ = Molar mass of the gas, $R$ = molar gas constant ($8.31 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$) , T = temperature ($K$)
$$pV = \frac{N}{N_A}RT$$
$$pV = \frac{R}{N_A}NT$$
$$pV = NkT$$
- Where $p$ = Pressure ($Pa$), $V$ = volume of the gas, $N$ = number of molecules of the gas, $k$ = Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$)  , $T$ = temperature ($K$)
## Kinetic theory of gasses
- We start with 4 basic assumptions (**DAVE**)
	- **D**uration of a collision is negligible compared to the time spent travelling between collisions
	- **A**ttractive forces among molecules are negligible so that they do not exert forces on each other except when the collide
	- **V**olume of the atoms or molecules in negligible compared with the volume occupied by the gas
	- **E**lastic collision between the molecules and the walls of the container, so that they bounce off the container and off each other without losing any kinetic energy
- Consider one molecule with mass $m$ and velocity $u$ perpendicular to the wall
![[kinetic energy of a gas.png]]
- Assuming collisions are elastic,
	- Initial momentum before collision: $\rho = mu$
	- Final momentum after collision: $\rho = m(-u$)
	- Change in momentum: $\Delta \rho = -2mu$
- Assuming the duration of the collision is negligible and the size of the molecule is negligible:
	- Time between consecutive collisions on the same wall, $t = \frac{2L}{u}$
- By newtons second law, the force exerted by the wall on the molecule = rate of change of momentum of the molecule = $\frac{-2mu}{\frac{2L}{u}} = \frac{-mu^2}{L}$
- By Newton's third law, the force exerted by the molecule on the wall is $\frac{mu^2}{L}$
- Assuming no intermolecular force,
	- As the molecules travel with different speeds, if there are $N$ molecules in the container, then total force is $F =  \frac{m(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + ... + u_N^2)}{L} = \frac{mN<u^2>}{L}$, where $<u^2> = \frac{(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + ... + u_N^2)}{N} =$ mean-square speed
- As pressure = force per unit area, $\frac{mN<u^2>}{L(L^2)} = \frac{Nm}{V} < u^2 >$
- In the container, there are molecules moving in the x, y and z directions with velocity $u$, $v$ and $w$ respectively
	- By Pythagoras Theroem, we have $c^2 = c_x^2 + c_y^2 + c_z^2 = u^2 + v^2 + w^2$ 
	- By taking average values, $<c^2> = <u^2> + <v^2> + <w^2>$
	- Because the motion is completely random, and the numbers of molecules is very large, $<u^2> = <v^2> = <w^2>$ 
	- Hence $<c^2> = 3<u^2>$
- Hence, we have $$pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$
- Where $p$ = pressure ($Pa$), $v$ = volume ($m^3$), $N$ = number of molecules, $m$ = mass of one molecule (kg), $<c^2>$ = mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
- Other forms include
$$p = \frac{1}{3}\frac{M}{V}<c^2>$$
- Where $p$ = pressure ($Pa$), $v$ = volume ($m^3$), $M$ = mass of the gas (kg), $<c^2>$ = mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
$$p = \frac{1}{3}\rho<c^2>$$
- Where $p$ = pressure ($Pa$), $\rho$ = density ($kg m^{-3}$), $<c^2>$ = mean-square speed ($m^2s^{-2}$)
### Ideal gas
 $$pV=\frac{1}{3}Nm<c^2>$$
$$pV=\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$
- As $pV = nRT$,
$$nRT=\frac{2}{3}N(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$
$$\frac{3}{2}\frac{n}{N}RT=(\frac{1}{2}m<c^2>)$$

$$\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> =\frac{3}{2}\frac{R}{N_a}T$$
$$\frac{1}{2}m<c^2> =\frac{3}{2}kT$$
- Hence, $$E_k =\frac{3}{2}kT$$
- Where $E_k$ = Kinetic energy, $k$ = Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$), $T$ = Temperature ($K$)
- **This is for one gas molecule only!!!!**
- Total mean translational kinetic energy of $N$ is $$E_k =\frac{3}{2}NkT = \frac{3}{2}nRT $$
- Where $E_k$ = Kinetic energy, $k$ = Boltzmann's constant ($\frac{8.31}{6.02 \times 10^{23}} = 1.38 \times 10^{-23} J k^{-1}$), $T$ = Temperature ($K$), $n$ = Number of moles of the gas ($mol$), $R$ = molar gas constant ($8.31 J mol^{-1} K^{-1}$) 
- Therefore, the total mean kinetic energy of an idea gas molecule is proportional to the temperature $$E_k \propto T$$
### Root-mean square speed
- It gives an "average" speed of the gas molecules
$$Root\ mean-squared\ speed = C_{rms} = \sqrt{c^2} = \sqrt{\frac{(u_1^2 + u_2^2 + u_3^2 + ... + u_N^2)}{N}}$$
## Kinetic particle theory
### Solids
- For a solid, very strong intermolecular forces bound the atoms/ molecules to a rigid structure called a lattice
- As such, they only have vibrational motion about their mean lattice points
- Internal energy is the sum of vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Liquids
- For a liquid, the intermolecular forces are weaker
- Molecules are held together in loose clusters 
- They can move from cluster to cluster while interacting with others
- Internal energy comprises of translational and vibrational kinetic energy and potential energy
### Gas
- For a gas, the intermolecular forces are very weak weak  
- The molecules move freely and independently
- Internal energy comprises mainly of translational kinetic energy and almost negligible potential energy (except when under high pressure)
## Specific heat capacity
- ==The specific heat capacity of a substance is the heat required to cause the per unit temperature rise per unit mass of the substance==
$$Q = mc\Delta \theta$$
- $Q$ = energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$ = mass of the object ($kg$), $c$ = specific heat capacity of the object ($J kg^{-1} K^{-1}$) , $\Delta \theta$ = change in temperature ($ºC/ K$)
## Specific latent heat of fusion/ vaporisation
- ==The specific latent heat of fusion of a substance is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from solid to liquid state without a change in temperature==
$$Q - ml_f$$
- $Q$ = energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$ = mass of the object, $l_f$ is the specific latent heat of fusion ($J kg^{-1}$)
- - ==The specific latent heat of vaporisation of a substance is defined as the amount of heat energy needed to change a unit mass of the substance from liquid to gaseous state without a change in temperature==
$$Q - ml_b$$
- $Q$ = energy absorbed or given out by the object ($J$), $m$ = mass of the object, $l_v$ is the specific latent heat of fusion ($J kg^{-1}$)
