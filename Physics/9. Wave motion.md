## Production of a wave
- ==The source of any wave is a vibration or oscillation==
- Waves provide a mechanism for the transfer of energy form one point to another without the physical transfer of any material between the points
## Types of waves
- Mechanical waves are waves that require a medium for the transfer of energy, and cannot travel through vacuum
- The particles in these waves carry potential and kinetic energies
- E.g. Water waves, sound waves, seismic waves
- Non-mechanical waves are waves that do not require a medium for the transfer of energy, and can travel through vacuum
- The energy in these waves is carried by oscillating energy and magnetic fields
- E.g. Light waves, radio waves and X-rays
### How mechanical waves transfer energy
- In mechanical waves, the particles undergo oscillations for energy to be transferred
- When the medium is disturbed, an atom is displaced from the equilibrium position
- The inter-atomic forces connecting it to neighbouring atoms will also cause neighbouring atoms to be displaced
- The disturbance, from the first atom will spread through the medium
- Thus, the disturbance, which is the source of the wave, creates a wave that transfers mechanical energy away from the first atom to the rest of the material
## Progressive waves
- ==A progressive wave is a wave in which the wave profile moves in the direction of propagation of the wave==
- They transfer energy from one point to another in the direction of wave velocity
### Transverse waves
- ==A transverse wave is one in which the direction where the direction of vibration of the wave particles is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- The waves travel from left to right, while individual particles oscillate up and down and do not travel with the wave
- E.g. EM waves, Water waves
### Longitudinal waves
- ==A longitudinal wave is one where the direction of vibration of the wave particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- They are formed out of a series of compressions and rarefactions
- Compressions are when the wave particles are close together than at equilibrium
- Rarefactions are when the wave particles are further apart than at equilibrium
- E.g. Sound waves only
- In a sound wave, 
	- Compressions are where the concentration of air particles is highest, and the atmospheric pressure is the highest
	- Rarefactions is where the concentration of air particles are the least, and atmospheric pressure is the lowest
## Terms used to describe waves
### Displacement-distance graph
![[displacement-distance graph.png]]
- The graph is like a snapshot of the wave
- Displacement is the distance of a particle from is equilibrium position
- Equilibrium position is the position of the wave particles when there is no wave motion
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a wave particle from equilibrium position
- Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive wave particles that are in phase with each other
- Wave velocity is the velocity which the wave profile (shape) advances
- Energy is transferred at this speed
- The speed of sound is $330 ms^{-1}$, while the speed of light is $3.0 \times 10^8ms^{-1}$
### Displacement-time graph
![[displacement-time graph.png]]
- A displacement-time graph shows the displacement of one particle in the wave over time
- The period is the time taken for one oscillation
- The period is also the the time taken for 1 wavelength to pass through the point
- Frequency is the number of complete oscillations per unit time made by the oscillating object
- It is also the number of crests/ troughs that pass through a point per unit time
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- Where $f$ = frequency ($Hz$), $T$ = Period ($s$)
### Phase and phase difference
- ==A phase is the state of disturbance of the particle==, or the stage of oscillation the particle is in
- Two points that are in phase means that they are precisely in the same state of disturbance
- Any two crests/troughs are in phase
- A crest and a trough are exactly $180\degree / \pi\ rad$ out of phase, and are always moving in opposite directions
### Calculating phase difference between two particles using distance

![[phase diff from distance.png]]
- Phase difference between particles
$$\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\times 2\pi$$
- Where $\Delta \phi$ = Phase difference ($rad$), $\Delta x$ = Distance between two points ($m$), $\lambda$ = Wavelength ($m$)
- In this case, it is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
- P leads Q by $\frac{\pi}{2} rad$
- Q lags P by $\frac{\pi}{2} rad$
- Q leads P by $-\frac{\pi}{2} rad$
- P lags Q by $-\frac{\pi}{2} rad$
### Calculating phase difference between two particles using time
![[phase diff from time.png]]
- Phase difference between particles
$$\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta t}{T}\times 2\pi$$
Where $\Delta \phi$ = Phase difference ($rad$), $\Delta t$ = difference in time ($s$), $T$ = period ($s$)
## Deriving basic wave equations
- One particle takes one period to undergo one complete oscillation
- In one period, the wave advanced by a distance equal to one wavelength
$$v = \frac{\Delta x}{t}$$
$$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$$
$$v = \lambda \times \frac{1}{T}$$
$$v = f\lambda$$
- Where $v$ = Wave speed ($ms^{-1}$), $f$ = frequency ($Hz$), $\lambda$ = Wavelength ($m$)
## Equations to describe a wave
### Displacement-distance graph
- The equation of a displacement-distance graph is $$y= Asin\theta$$
- Using the equation for phase difference, $$y= Asin(\frac{x}{\lambda} \times 2\pi)$$
$$y= Asin(kx)$$
- Where $y$ = displacement ($m$), $A$ = amplitude ($m$),  $k$  = wave number=$\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, $x$ =distance
### Displacement-distance graph of a longitudinal wave
![[how to get pressure distance graph.png]]
- Suppose a sinusoidal longitudinal wave, whose wavelength is equal to distance between particles 1 to 9
- Taking the right to be positive y-displacement, and the left to be negative y-displacement about the equilibrium, we get the curve as shown
- 1 wavelength is the distance from a compression to a compression/ rarefaction to a rarefaction
### Displacement-time graph
- The equation for a displacement-time graph is same as the equation for displacement of one particle$$y= Asin(\omega t)$$
- - Where $y$ = displacement ($m$), $A$ = amplitude ($m$),  $\omega$ = angular frequency, $t$ =time
## Intensity and amplitude
- ==Intensity is the energy transmitted per unit time across unit area of a surface perpendicular to the directions of energy flow==
- It has the units of $W m^{-2}$$$Intensity = \frac{Power}{Area} = \frac{Energy}{Time \times Area}$$
- For mechanical waves, with each particle executing simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy per molecule is$$E = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2A^2 = \frac{1}{2}m(2\pi f)^2A^2$$
- Where $E$ = Energy ($J$), $m$ = Mass of a molecule ($Kg$) , $A$ = Amplitude of oscillation ($m$), $\omega$ = angular frequency ($rad\ s^{-1}$), $f$ = Frequency ($Hz$)
$$Intensity = \frac{Power}{Area} = \frac{Energy}{Time \times Area}$$
$$I = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2A^2}{Time \times Area}$$
$$I \propto f^2A^2$$

- For a wave with fixed frequency, $$I \propto A^2$$
- Where $I$ = Intensity ($W m^{-2}$), $m$ = Mass of a molecule ($Kg$) , $A$ = Amplitude of oscillation ($m$), $\omega$ = angular frequency ($rad\ s^{-1}$), $f$ = Frequency ($Hz$)
### Dispersion of energy from a point source
- As wave energy emitted from a point source spreads out, the intensity of the wave will diminish with increasing distance from the source
- In the simplest case, the wave energy spreads out uniformly in all directions from the point source and travelling without a loss of energy
- The emitted power is spread out uniformly over the surface of a sphere
 ![[dispersion of wave energy from a point source.png]]
 - The intensity can be found using
$$I = \frac{P}{Area} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
$$I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
- Where  $I$ = Intensity ($W m^{-2}$), $P$ = Power ($W$), $r$ = Distance from point source ($m$)
## Polarisation
- ==Polarisation is the effect of making wave oscillations to be limited to a single planar direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- Only transverse waves can be polarised
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised
- Particles in a longitudinal wave vibrate in an axis parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave, hence the amplitude of longitudinal wave cannot be cut off
- Polarisation is usually only applied to only light or other EM waves, but it can also be applied to simple waves like rope waves
### Polarisation of EM waves
- Light is an EM wave
- EM waves are transverse waves consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- But, there are no specific directions for the oscillations for the electric and magnetic fields, it oscillates in any randomly oriented plane to the direction of propagation
- This is called unpolarised light, as it is composed of many waves with all possible directions of polarisation
- EM waves can be polarised using polarising filters
- Only light polarised in the direction parallel to the axis of polarisation is able to pass through, causing the resulting oscillations to only oscillate in one direction
 ![[polarization of EM waves.png]]
 >[!NOTE]
 >The intensity of light after passing through one polariser is half its original intensity
### Malus' law
- If a polarised EM wave is incident upon a polariser, only the component of the electric field that is parallel to the polarising axis of the polariser will be transmitted
![[malus law.png]]
$$I \propto A^2 \rightarrow I = kA^2$$
- where $k$ is a constant
- Initial intensity: $$I_0 = kA_0^2$$
-  Amplitude of transmitted wave:
$$A_t = A_0 cos(\theta)$$
- Where $A_t$ is the transmitted wave's amplitude ($m$), $A_0$ is the original amplitude ($m$), $\theta$ is the angle between the incident wave and the axis of polarisation ($rad$)

- Transmitted intensity: $$I_t = kA_t^2= k (A_0 \cos \theta)^2 = I_0 \cos^2\theta$$
$$I_t = I_0 \cos^2\theta$$
- Where $I_t$ is the transmitted intensity ($W m^{-2}$), $I_0$ is the original intensity ($W m^{-2}$), $\theta$ is the angle between the incident wave and the axis of polarisation ($rad$)
## Using a C.R.O. to determine the frequency of a sound wave
![[CRO to determine sound frequency.png]]
- C.R.O on the time base setting
- The microphone detects pressure variation in air and converts them into electric signals to be fed into the C.R.O.
- The C.R.O. then plots a pressure time graph, which is equivalent to a displacement time graph for one particle
- The period can be measured from the screen, and the frequency can be found suing $f = \frac{1}{T}$
