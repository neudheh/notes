## Production of a wave
- ==The source of any wave is a vibration or oscillation==
- Waves provide a mechanism for the transfer of energy form one point to another without the physical transfer of any material between the points
## Mechanical waves
- Mechanical waves are waves which require a medium for the transfer of energy
- The particles in these wave carry potential and kinetic energies
- These waves cannot travel through a vacuum
- E.g. water waves, sound waves, seismic waves
- Non-mechanical waves do not require a medium for the transfer of energy
- The energy in the waves is carried by the oscillating electric and magnetic fields
- These waves can travel through vacuum
- E.g. EM waves such as light waves, radio waves and X-rays
## Progressive waves
- ==A progressive wave is one which the wave profile moves in the direction of propagation of the wave==
- Transfer energy from one point to another in the direction of wave velocity
- The opposite is stationary waves, where the wave profile does not progress and all the energy is trapped in the wave
### Transverse waves
- ==A transverse wave is one in which the direction of vibration of the wave particles is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- The wave travels left to right while individual parts of the spring oscillate up and down and do not travel with the wave
### Longitudinal waves
- A longitudinal wave is one in which the direction of vibration of the wave particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
- They are formed of a series of compressions and rarefactions
- Compression occur when the wave particles are closer together than at equilibrium while rarefactions occur when the loops are further apart than at equilibrium
- Only sound waves are longitudinal waves, all others are transverse
- In a sound wave,
	- Compressions are where the concentration of air particles are the highest, and the atmospheric pressure is the greatest
	- Rarefactions are where the concentration of air particles are the lowest, and atmospheric pressure is the lowest
## Terms used to describe waves
### Displacement-distance graphs
- Displacement-distance graphs is like a snapshot of a wave
![[displacement-distance graph.png]]
- Displacement is the distance form a particle form its equilibrium position
- Equilibrium position is the position of the wave particle when there is no wave motion
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a particle form its equilibrium position
- Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive particles in the wave that are in phase
- Wave velocity is the velocity where the wave profile (shape) advances
- Energy is is transferred through space at this speed
>[!NOTE]
>The speed of sound is $330ms^{-1}$
>The speed of light is $3.0 \times 10^8 ms^{-1}$
### Displacement-time graphs
- The displacement-time graph shows the change in position of **ONE PARTICLE** in the wave over time
![[displacement-time graph.png]]
- The period is the time taken for a wave particle to complete one full oscillation, or to move a distance of one wavelength
- The frequency is the number of complete oscillations undergone by a wave particle per unit time, or the number of crests that pass through a given point per unit time
$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- $f$: Frequency
- $T$: Period
### Phase and phase difference
- ==A phase is the state of disturbance of the particle==, or the stage of oscillation the particle is in
- Two points that are in phase means that they are precisely in the same state of disturbance
- Any two crests/ troughs are in phase
- A crest and a trough are $180\degree$/ $\pi\ radians$ out of phase, and are moving in opposite directions
### Calculation of phase difference between two particles using distance
![[phase diff from distance.png]]
- Phase difference between particles$$\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\times 2 \pi$$
	- $\phi$ : Phase
	- $\Delta x$ : Distance between two particles
	- $\lambda$: Wavelength
- In this case, it is $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
- The following are equivalent statements
	- P leads Q by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
	- Q lags P by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
	- Q leads P by $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
	- P lags Q by $-\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians
- Waves reach P first, then Q
### Calculation of phase difference between two particles using time
- If we plot the displacement-time graphs of P and Q
![[phase diff from time.png]]
- Find the time taken to reach a crest/ trough for both
- P peaks earlier than Q by $\Delta t = \frac{1}{4}T$
- Phase difference between particles$$\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta t}{T} \times 2 \pi$$
	- $\phi$ : Phase
	- $\Delta t$: Difference in time between both particles to reach a crest/ trough 
	- $T$: Period
## Deriving basic wave equations
- It takes a wave particle 1 period to undergo one complete oscillation
- In one period, the wave travels a distance of one wavelength
$$v = \frac{distance\ travelled}{time\ taken}$$
$$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$$
$$v = \lambda \frac{1}{T}$$
$$v=f\lambda$$
## Equations used to describe waves
### Displacement-distance graph
- The equation of a displacement-distance graph is $$y= Asin\theta$$
- Using the equation for phase difference ($\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}$),$$y = A sin(\frac{x}{\lambda}\times 2\pi)$$
$$y = Asin(kx)$$
- $A$: amplitude
- $k$: Wave number ($\frac{2 \pi}{\lambda}$)
### Displacement-distance graph for a longitudinal wave
![[how to get pressure distance graph.png]]
- Suppose a sinusoidal longitudinal wave, whose wavelength is the distance between particles 1 to 9
- Taking the rightward direction as the positive displacement of a particle and leftward direction as negative displacement about the equilibrium
- Taking displacement to the right of the equilibrium as representing as positive y-displacement, we get the curve shown
- 1 wavelength is the distance from a compression to a compression/ rarefaction to a rarefaction
### Displacement-time graph
- As each wave particle is undergoing simple harmonic motion, we can use the equation $$y = Asin(\omega t)$$
	- $A$: Amplitude
	- $\omega$: Angular velocity ($\frac{2\pi}{T}$)
	- $t$: Frequency
- Displacement time graph is for one particle only!!!
- The direction of wave velocity allows us to determine the wave profile at a later time
## Intensity and amplitude
- ==Intensity is the energy transmitted per unit time across unit area of a surface perpendicular to the direction of the energy flow==$$Intensity = \frac{Power}{Area} = \frac{Energy}{Time \times Area}$$
- As each wave particle is undergoing SHM, we can use the equation for the total energy of a wave particle
$$I = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mA^2\omega^2}{Time \times Area} = \frac{\frac{1}{2}mA^2{2\pi f}^2}{Time \times Area}$$
$$I \propto f^2A^2$$
- For a wave with fixed frequency, $$I \propto A^2$$
## Dispersion of wave energy from a point source
- As the wave energy emitted form a point source spreads out, the intensity of the wave will diminish with increasing distance from the source
- In the simplest case, the wave energy spreads out uniformly in all directions from the point source, and travels without a loss of energy
- Thus, the energy is spread out uniformly over the surface area of a sphere 
![[dispersion of wave energy from a point source.png]]
- The intensity can be found by using$$I = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
$$I \propto \frac{1}{r^2}$$
- $I$: Intensity
- $P$: Power
- $r$: radius/ distance from source
- The further the wave is from the source, the smaller the intensity as the power of the wave has been distributed over a larger surface area
## Polarization
- Polarization is the effect of making wave oscillations to be limited to a single planar direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave
- Only transverse waves can be polarized
- Longitudinal wave cannot be polarized as particles in a longitudinal wave vibrate in an axis parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave, and the amplitude of the longitudinal wave cannot be cut off
- Polarization is usually applied only to light or other Em waves, but it can also be applied to simple waves such as rope waves
### Polarization of EM waves
- Light is a type of an EM wave
- EM waves are transverse waves consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- But, in general there are no specific directions for the oscillations of the electric and magnetic fields, they vibrate in any randomly oriented plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- This is called unpolarized light, as they have many waves with all possible directions of polarization
- Unpolarized light can be polarized using polarizing filters/ polarizers/ polaroids
- Only light polarized in the direction parallel to the axis of polarization of the polarizer is able to pass through it
![[polarization of EM waves.png]]
### Malus law
- If a polarized EM wave is incident upon a polarizer, only the component of the electric field vector that is parallel to the polarizing axis of the polarizer will be transmitted
![[malus law.png]]
$$I \propto A^2$$
- Initial intensity: $$I_0 = k A_0\ ^2$$
- k is a constant
- Transmitted intensity$$I_t = kA_t\ ^2 = k(A_0 cos \theta)^2 = I_0 cos^2 \theta$$
- Transmitted  amplitude $$A_t = A_0 cos \theta$$
## Using a C.R.O. to determine the frequency of a sound wave
![[CRO to determine sound frequency.png]]
- C.R.O on the time base setting
- The microphone detects pressure variation in air and converts them into electric signals to be fed into the C.R.O.
- The C.R.O. then plots a pressure time graph, which is equivalent to a displacement time graph for one particle
- The period can be measured from the screen, and the frequency can be found suing $f = \frac{1}{T}$
