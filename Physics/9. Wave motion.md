- ==The source of any wave is a vibration or oscillation==
- ==Waves provide a mechanism for the transfer of energy from one point to another, without they physical transfer of any material between the points==
## Types of waves
- Mechanical waves a waves that require a medium for the transfer of energy
- The particles in a mechanical wave carry potential and kinetic energies
- Mechanical waves cannot travel through a vacuum
- E.g. water waves, sound waves, seismic waves
- Non-mechanical waves do not need a medium for the transfer of energy
- The energy in the waves is carried by oscillating electric and magnetic fields
- Non-mechanical waves can travel through vacuum
- E.g. electromagnetic waves
### How mechanical waves transfer energy
- In mechanical waves, the particles undergo oscillations for energy to be transported through space and time
- When the medium is disturbed, an atom is displaced from its equilibrium position
- The inter-atomic forces connecting it to neighboring atoms will cause these atoms to also displace from their equilibrium position
- This way, the disturbance, which is the source of the wave, from the first atom will spread through the medium
- This will result in a wave that carries mechanical energy away from the first atom to the rest of the material
### Progressive waves
- ==Progressive waves are one in which the wave profile moves in the direction of propagation of the wave==
- Progressive waves transfer energy from one point to another in the direction of the wave velocity
- ==A transverse wave is one where the wave direction of vibration of the wave particles is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- The wave travel from left to right, but the particles oscillate up and down and not travel with the wave
- ==A longitudinal wave is one where the direction of vibration of the wave particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave== 
- The individual particles in the wave move back and forth about their equilibrium positions, causing a series of compressions and rarefactions
- In a sound wave, compressions occur when the concentration of air particles is the highest, and the atmospheric pressure is the greatest
- Rarefactions occur when the concentration of air particles is the lowest, and atmospheric pressure is the lowest
## Terms used to describe waves
### Displacement-distance graph
![[displacement-distance graph.png]]
- The graph is like a snapshot of the wave
- Displacement is the distance of a particle from its equilibrium position
- Equilibrium position is the position of the wave particle when there is no wave motion
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a particle from the equilibrium position
- Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive particles in the wave who are in phase with each other
- Wave velocity is the velocity which the wave profile advances
- Energy is transferred through space at this speed
### Displacement-time graph
- The displacement time graph shows the change in position of one particle over time
![[displacement-time graph.png]]
- The period is the time take for a wave particle to complete on oscillation, or the time taken for the wave to travel one wavelength
- The frequency is the number of oscillations undergone by a wave particle per unit time, or the number of crests that pass through a given point per unit time$$f = \frac{1}{T}$$
- Where $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
## Phase and phase difference
- ==Phase is the state of disturbance of the particle, or stage of oscillation the particle is in==
- Two points that are in phase means that they are precisely in the same state of disturbance
- ==Any two crests and any two throughs are in phase==
- A crest and a through are $180\degree / \pi rad$ out of phase, and are always moving in opposite directions
### Calculating phase difference from a displacement-distance graph
![[phase diff from distance.png]]
- Distance between P and Q = $\Delta x$ = $\frac{1}{4}\lambda$
- Phase difference between P and Q in radians $$\Delta \phi = \frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\times 2 \pi$$
- Where $\Delta\phi$: Phase difference ($rad$), $x$: Distance ($m$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
- In this case it is $\frac{\pi}{2}$
- P leads Q by $\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ 
- Q lags P by$\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ 
- P lags Q by $-\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ 
- Q leads P by $-\frac{\pi}{2} rad$ 
### Calculating phase difference from a displacement-time graph
![[phase diff from time.png]]
- P peaks earlier than Q by $\Delta t$ = $\frac{1}{4}T$
- Phase difference between P and Q in radians $$\Delta \phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times2\pi$$
- Where $\Delta\phi$: Phase difference ($rad$), $\Delta t$: Difference in time ($s$), $T$: Period ($s$)
## Basic wave equation
- A wave particle takes 1 period to undergo one complete oscillation
- In one period, the wave advances by a distance equal to one wavelength
- Hence, $$v = \frac{s}{t}$$$$v = \frac{\lambda}{T}$$
$$v=f\lambda$$
- Where $v$: Wave speed ($ms^{-1}$), $f$: frequency ($Hz$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
## Equations to describe a wave
### Displacement-distance graph
- The equation of a displacement-time graph is $$y= A\sin\theta$$
- Where $\theta$ is the phase $$y= A\sin(\frac{x}{\lambda}\times2\pi)$$$$y = A\sin(kx)$$
- Where $y$: displacement ($m$), $A$: amplitude ($m$),  $k$: wave number=$\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$, $x$: distance ($m$)
### Displacement-distance graph of a longitudinal wave
![[how to get pressure distance graph.png]]
- Suppose a sinusoidal longitudinal wave whose wavelength is equal to the distance between particles 1 and 9
- Taking the rightward direction as the positive displacement of a particle, and leftward direct as the negative displacement about the equilibrium, we get the curve shown
- 1 wavelength is the distance from a compression to a compression/ rarefaction to a rarefaction
### Displacement-time graph
- The equation of a displacement time graph is the equation displacement for one particle$$y= Asin(\omega t)$$
- Where $y$ = displacement ($m$), $A$ = amplitude ($m$),  $\omega$ = angular frequency, $t$ =time
## Intensity and amplitude
- ==Intensity is the energy transmitted per unit time across unit area of a surface perpendicular to the direction of the energy flow == $$Intensity = \frac{Power}{Area}= \frac{Energy}{Time \times Area}$$
- SI units of watts per meter squared ($Wm^{-2}$)
- For mechanical waves, with each particle executing simple harmonic motion, the mechanical energy per molecule $$E = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2A^2 =\frac{1}{2}m(2\pi f)^2A^2$$
- Where $E$: Energy ($J$), $m$: mass of one particle ($kg$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rads^{-1}$), A: Amplitude ($m$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
- Thus, the intensity would be given by$$Intensity = \frac{\frac{1}{2}m(2\pi f)^2A^2}{Time \times Area}$$$$I\propto f^2A^2$$
- For a wave with fixed frequency, $$I \propto A^2$$
- Where $I$: Intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $A$: Amplitude ($m$)
### Dispersion of waves from a point source
- As the wave energy emitted from a point source spreads out, the intensity of the wave will diminish with increasing distance from the source
- The wave energy spreads out uniformly in all directions from the point source and travelling without a loss of energy
- The emitted power is then spread out uniformly over the surface of the sphere as shown
![[dispersion of wave energy from a point source.png]]
- The intensity of the wave energy is given by $$I = \frac{P}{Area} = \frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$$
- For a source with constant power, $$I \propto r^2$$
- Where  $I$ = Intensity ($W m^{-2}$), $P$ = Power ($W$), $r$ = Distance from point source ($m$)
## Polarisation
- Polarisation is the effect of making wave oscillation limited to a single planar direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave
- Polarisation occurs with all transverse wave
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarised, as particles in a longitudinal wave oscillate in a axis parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
- Hence, the amplitude of the wave cannot be cut off
### Polarisation of an EM wave
- EM waves are transverse waves consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- But, they vibrate in any randomly oriented plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, which is known as unpolarised light
- It is composed of many wave with all possible directions of polarisation
- EM waves can be polarised using polarising filters (polarisers or polaroids)
- Only light polarised in the direction parallel to the axis of polarisation of the polarisation is able to pass through it
- The resulting oscillation are only in one direction ![[polarization of EM waves.png]]

 >[!NOTE]
 >The intensity of light after passing through one polariser is half its original intensity

### Malus law
- If a polarising EM wave is incident upon a polariser, only the component of the electric field vector that is parallel to the polarising axis of the polariser will be transmitted
- The component of the electric field vector that is perpendicular to the axis will be blocked
![[malus law.png]]
$$I \propto A^2 \rightarrow I = kA^2$$
- Initially, $$I_0 = kA_0^2$$
- Amplitude of transmitted wave $$A_t = A_0\cos(\theta)$$
- Where $A_t$: transmitted wave's amplitude ($m$), $A_0$: original amplitude ($m$), $\theta$: angle between the incident wave and the axis of polarisation ($rad$)
- Transmitted intensity $$I_t = kA_t^2 = k(A_0\cos\theta)^2 = I_0\cos^2\theta$$
$$I_t = I_0 \cos^2\theta$$
- Where $I_t$: Transmitted intensity ($Wm^-2$), $I_0$: Original intensity($Wm^{-2}$), $\theta$: Angle between the incident wave and the axis of polarisation
## Using a C.R.O. to determine the frequency of a sound wave
![[CRO to determine sound frequency.png]]
- C.R.O on the time base setting
- The microphone detects pressure variation in air and converts them into electric signals to be fed into the C.R.O.
- The C.R.O. then plots a pressure time graph, which is equivalent to a displacement time graph for one particle
- The period can be measured from the screen, and the frequency can be found suing $f = \frac{1}{T}$
