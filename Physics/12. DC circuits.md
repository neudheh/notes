- In a direct current (DC) circuits, current only flows in one direction
- DC can be obtained from AC (Alternating current) by using a rectifier, which only allows current to flow in one direction
## Series circuit
![[series circuit.png]]
- Current through the circuit is the same for each resistor in a series circuit
- The total voltage is the sum of voltages across each component
### Deriving effective resistance
- Potential difference across each resistor is given by$$V_1 = IR_1, V_2 = IR_2, V_3 =IR_3, ... V_N = IR_N $$
$$V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ... + V_N$$
$$V = IR_1 + IR_2 + IR_3 + ... + IR_N$$
$$\frac{V}{I} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_N$$
$$R = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_N$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
## Parallel circuit
![[parallel circuit.png]]
- Total current is the sum of the current in each of the parallel branches
- The potential difference across each of the parallel prances is the same
### Deriving effective resistance
- Current across each parallel branch is given by $$I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1}, I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2}, I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3}, ... I_N = \frac{V}{R_N}$$
$$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + ... + I_N$$
$$I = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{V}{R_3} + ... + \frac{V}{R_N}$$
$$\frac{I}{V} = \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_N}$$
$$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_N}$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
- The effective resistance is always smaller than the lower resistance in the parallel network

>[!Problem solving strategies]
>1. Trace the current from one end of the battery to the other, one loop at a time and redraw the circuit
>2. Simplify the resistors in the circuit until you get one big effective resistor
>3. Identify and label points int he circuit that are of the same potential, and remove resistors where the p.d. across it is zero (no current flowing through it)


## Potential-divider principle
- A potential divider is a series circuit that produces an output voltage that is a fraction of its input voltage
- Voltage division is the result of distributing the input voltage among the resistors and the divider
![[potential divider.png]]
- The circuit current is $$I = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2}$$
- Hence, the output voltage across $R_1$ is $$V_1 = I \times R_1$$$$V_1 = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2} \times R_1$$$$V_1 = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}\times R_1$$
- Hence, by potential divider principle, if an input voltage V exists across several resistors connected in series, then the output voltage across any resistor will be $$V_1 = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3 +... + R_N}\times R_1$$
- Where $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
### Thermistor
- An NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor is a semiconductor device whose resistance decreases as temperature increases
- It is used in a fire alarm
![[potential divider thermistor.png]]
- When the temperature rises, the resistance of the thermistor falls, causing total resistance to fall
- As total resistance falls, $V_R$ rises and a large enough current is allowed to flow through $R$, activating the fire alarm
### LDR (Light dependent resistor)
- An LDR is a semiconductor device whose resistance decreases when light intensity falling on it increases
- Also used in fire alarms
![[potential divider ldr.png]]
- As the light intensity shining on the LDR increases, the resistance of the LDR falls, causing total resistance to fall
- As total resistance falls, $V_R$ rises and a large enough current is allowed to flow through $R$, activating the fire alarm
## Potentiometer
- A potentiometer is a long resistive wire (e.g. constantan) of uniform cross-sectional area and a batter
- The potential falls uniformly from a maximum value at A to a minimum value at B
![[potentiometer.png]]
- For a uniform wire of length $L$, $$R = \frac{\rho l}{A}$$$$R \propto l$$
- The potential dropped across a segment of wire of uniform cross-section area carrying a constant current is directly proportional to its length
- From $V = IR$, $$V \propto l$$
### Measuring e.m.f and internal resistance
![[potentiometer measuring e.m.f and internal resistance.png]]
1. Open the switch S
2. Connect the terminal X of the unknown cell $\varepsilon _1$ to A (positive to positive), and terminal Y to a galvanometer
3. A sliding contact (jockey) is connected to the other end of the galvanometer, and is moved along the wire AB until a point C is found such that there is no current in the galvanometer
	 - This point is known as the balance point, and the length $L_{AC}$ is known as the balance length
 4. When there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, the potential difference across AC is equal to the potential difference across XY $$V\propto l$$$$\frac{\varepsilon _1}{\varepsilon} = \frac{L_{AC}}{L}$$
 5. To find internal resistance, close the switch S, and repeat steps 3 and 4, and use the equation $\varepsilon = Ir+ V_{xy}$
### Comparing e.m.f
 ![[potentiometer comparison of emf.png]]
 1. Connect one end of the galvanometer to Y, and the other to the jockey, and find the balance length by moving along the wire until point C is found where the galvanometer registers 0 current
 2. Repeat with the other end of the galvanometer connected to Z instead of Y
 3. The p.d. across their terminals is their e.m.f. as there is no current drawn from either cell $$\frac{e1}{e2} = \frac{L_1}{L_2}$$
