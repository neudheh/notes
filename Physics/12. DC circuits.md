## Direct current
- In direct current, the electric charge (current) flows in one direction
- In alternating current, the current changes direction periodically, and the potential difference also periodically reverses
## Series and parallel arrangements
### Series
- The current that flows through a series circuit is the same for each resistor in a series circuit
- For a series circuit, $V=V_1+V_2+V_3+...+V_N\rightarrow V=IR_1+IR_2+IR_3+...+IR_N\rightarrow\frac{V}{I}=R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_N$
- Hence, $$R=R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_N$$
- $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$)
### Parallel
- The potential difference across each parallel branch is the same in a parallel circuit
- For a parallel circuit, $$I=I_1+I_2+I_3+...+I_R\rightarrow I=\frac{V}{R_1}+\frac{V}{R_2}+\frac{V}{R_3}+...+\frac{V}{R_N}\rightarrow\frac{I}{V}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+...+\frac{1}{R_N}$$
- Hence, $$\frac{1}{R}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}+\frac{1}{R_3}+...+\frac{1}{R_N}$$
- $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$)
- The total resistance is always smaller than the lowest resistance in the parallel network
- If there are only 2 resistors, then we can use the formula $R=\frac{R_1\times R_2}{R_1+R_2}$

>[!Problem solving strategies]
>1. Trace the current from one end of the battery to the other, one loop at a time and redraw the circuit
>2. Simplify the resistors in the circuit until you get one big effective resistor
>3. Identify and label points int he circuit that are of the same potential, and remove resistors where the p.d. across it is zero (no current flowing through it)

## Potential divider
![[potential divider.png]]
- The current $I=\frac{V}{R_1+R_2}$
- Hence, the output voltage across $R_1$ is $V_1 =IR_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2}V$
- Hence, we get the potential divider principle
  $$V_1=\frac{R_1}{R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_N}V$$
- $V$: Voltage ($V$), $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$)
### Thermistor
- An NTC (negative temperature coefficient) thermistor's resistance decreases as temperature increases
- Used in fire alarms
![[potential divider thermistor.png]]
- When the surrounding temperature is high, the resistance $R_T$ drops, and the resistance $R_T$ is small enough to let a large current flow through $R$
- Total resistance falls, hence $V_R$ is large, hence it will activate the fire alarm
### LDR
- An LDR's resistance decreases when the light intensity falling on it increases
- Also used in fire alarms
![[potential divider ldr.png]]
- When the surroundings are bright, the resistance $R_{LDR}$ drops, and the resistance $R_{LDR}$ is small enough to let a large current flow through $R$
- Total resistance falls, hence $V_R$ is large, hence it will activate the fire alarm
## Potentiometer
- A potentiometer is a long resistive wire (e.g. constantan) of uniform cross-sectional area and a battery
- The potential falls uniformly from a maximum value at $A$ to a minimum value at $B$
![[potentiometer.png]]
- For a uniform wire of length L, $R=\frac{\rho l}{A}\rightarrow R\propto l$
- From $V=IR$, $V\propto l$
- The potential dropped across a segment of wire is directly proportional to its length
### Measuring e.m.f. and internal resistance
![[potentiometer measuring e.m.f and internal resistance.png]]
1. Open the switch S
2. Connect the terminal X of the unknown cell $\varepsilon_1$ to A (positive to positive), and terminal Y to a galvanometer
3. A jockey is connected to the other end of the galvanometer, and moved along AB until a point C is found where there is no current in the galvanometer
	- This is known as the balance point, and the length $L_{AC}$ is the balance length
4. When there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, the potential difference across AC is equal to the potential difference across XY
$$V\propto l\rightarrow\frac{\varepsilon_1}{\varepsilon}=\frac{L_{AC}}{L}$$
5. To find internal resistance, close the switch S, repeat steps 3-4 and use the equation $\varepsilon=Ir+V_{xy}$
### Comparing e.m.f.
![[potentiometer comparison of emf.png]]
1. Connect one end of the galvanometer to Y, and the other end to a jockey
2. Move the jockey along point C until the galvanometer registers 0 current, and obtain the balance
3. Repeat 1-2  but connect the galvanometer to Z instead of Y
4. The p.d. across their terminals is their e.m.f. as there is no current drawn from either cell $$\frac{e1}{e2} = \frac{L_1}{L_2}$$
