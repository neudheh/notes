## DC circuits
- In DC circuits, the electric charge (current) only flows in one direction
- In AC circuits, the electric charge (current) changes direction periodically
## Series circuit
![[series circuit.png]]
- Current through the circuit is the same for each resistor in a series circuit
- The total voltage is the sum of voltages across each component
### Deriving effective resistance
- Potential difference across each resistor is given by$$V_1 = IR_1, V_2 = IR_2, V_3 =IR_3, ... V_N = IR_N $$
$$V = V_1 + V_2 + V_3 + ... + V_N$$
$$V = IR_1 + IR_2 + IR_3 + ... + IR_N$$
$$\frac{V}{I} = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_N$$
$$R = R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_N$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
## Parallel circuit
![[parallel circuit.png]]
- Total current is the sum of the current in each of the parallel branches
- The potential difference across each of the parallel prances is the same
### Deriving effective resistance
- Current across each parallel branch is given by $$I_1 = \frac{V}{R_1}, I_2 = \frac{V}{R_2}, I_3 = \frac{V}{R_3}, ... I_N = \frac{V}{R_N}$$
$$I = I_1 + I_2 + I_3 + ... + I_N$$
$$I = \frac{V}{R_1} = \frac{V}{R_2} = \frac{V}{R_3} + ... + \frac{V}{R_N}$$
$$\frac{I}{V} = \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_N}$$
$$\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} = \frac{1}{R_2} = \frac{1}{R_3} + ... + \frac{1}{R_N}$$
- Where $I$ = Current ($A$), $V$ = Potential difference ($V$), R = Resistance ($\Omega$)
- The effective resistance is always smaller than the lower resistance in the parallel network
>[!NOTE]
>Problem solving strategies
>1. Trace the current from one end of the batter to the other, one loop at a time and redraw the circuit
>2. Simplify the resistors in the circuit until you get one big effective resistor
>3. Identify and label points in the circuit that are of the same potential, and remove the resistor where the P.d. across it is zero (no current flowing through it)
## Potential-divider principle
![[potential divider.png]]
- A potential divider is a series circuit that produces an output voltage that is a fraction of its input voltage
- Consider the above circuit
$$I = \frac{V}{R_1+ R_2}$$
$$V_1 = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2}\times R_1$$
$$V_1 = \frac{R_1}{R_1 + R_2}\times V$$
- Hence, by potential divider principle, if an input voltage V exits across several resistors connected in series, then $$V_1 = \frac{V}{R_1 + R_2 + R_3 + ... + R_N}\times R_1$$
### Thermistor
- An NTC (negative thermistor coefficient) thermistor is a semiconductor device whose resistance **decrease** as temperature **increases**
- It is used in a fire alarm
![[potential divider fire alarm.png]]
- When the temperature rises, the resistance of the thermistor increases, causing total resistance to fall
- As total resistance falls, $V_R$ rises and a large enough current is allowed to flow through $R$, activating the fire alarm
### LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
- An LDR is a semi conductor device whose resistance **decreases** when light intensity falling on it **increases**
- Also used in fire alarms
![[potential divider ldr.png]]
- As the light intensity shining on the LDR increases, the resistance of the LDR falls, causing total resistance to fall
- As total resistance falls, $V_R$ rises and a large enough current is allowed to flow through $R$, activating the fire alarm
## Potentiometer
- A potentiometer is a long resistive wire (e.g. constantan) of uniform cross-sectional area and a battery
- The potential falls uniformly from a maximum value at A to a minimum value at B
![[potentiometer.png]]
- For a uniform wire of length $L$, $$R = \frac{\rho L}{A}$$
$$R \propto L$$
- The potential dropped across a segment of wire of uniform across section carrying a constant current is directly proportional to its length
- From $V = IR$, $$V \propto L$$
### Measuring e.m.f and internal resistance
![[potentiometer measuring e.m.f and internal resistance.png]]
1. Open the switch S
2. Connect the terminal X of the unknown cell $e1$ to $A$ (positive to positive) and terminal Y to a galvanometer
3. A sliding contact (jockey) is connected to the other end of the galvanometer, and is moved along the wire AB until a point C is found such that there is no current in the galvanometer
	- This point is known as the balance point, and the length $L_{AC}$ is known as the balance length
4. When there is no current flowing through the galvanometer, the potential difference across AC is equal to the potential across XY
$$V \propto L$$
$$\frac{e1}{e} = \frac{L_{AC}}{L}$$
5. To find internal resistance, close the switch S, and repeat steps 3 and 4, and use equation $e = Ir + V_{xy}$
### Comparing e.m.f
![[potentiometer comparison of emf.png]]
1. Connect one end of the galvanometer to Y and the other to the jockey and find the balance length by tapping the jockey on the resistance wire until the galvanometer registers 0 current
2. Repeat with the other end of the galvanometer connected to Z instead of Y
3. The p.d. across their terminals is their e.m.f. s as there is no current drawn from either cell
$$\frac{e1}{e2} = \frac{L_1}{L_2}$$
