## Principle of superposition
- Interference refers the phenomenon of two or more waves of the same kind meeting at a point in space to produce a resultant wave disturbance given by the superposition of individual waves at that point
- ==The principle of superposition states that the resultant wave displacement is given by the vectorial sum of the individual wave displacement at the point where the waves meet==
- Waves have to be added vectorially
![[constructive and destructive inteference.png]]
- Constructive interference occurs when waves are meeting in phase
- The amplitude of the resultant waves is the sum of the amplitude of each individual waves
- Destructive interference occurs when waves meet out of phase ($180 \degree$)
- The amplitude of the resultant wave is 0
## Stationary waves
- Stationary waves are from of the interference of two waves
	- of the same type
	- same frequency (hence same propagation speed and wavelength)
	- same amplitude
	- travelling in exactly opposite directions to each other
![[stationary waves.gif]]
![[stationary wave.png]]
### Properties
![[stationary waves diagram.png]]
- The resultant wave profile shows no sign of progression in either direction
- Individual particles are executing simple harmonic oscillations with the same frequency except at the nodes
- Amplitude of vibration varies from zero at the nodes, where the particle is permanently at zero displacement, to maximum at the antinodes
- The wave is divided into a number of segments of loops by the pattern of nodes and antinodes
- All particles in the same segment/ loop are vibrating in phase, but particles in adjacent segments or loops are $180\degree$ out of phase with one another
- The distance from a node to a node or a antinode to an antinode is half a wavelength ($\frac{1}{2}\lambda$)
- The distance from a consecutive node to an antinode is one quarter of a wavelength ($\frac{1}{4}\lambda$)
- There is no transmission of energy along the progression of waves, all the energy is contained within the stationary waves
- When the wave is at its maximum position, all of its energy is in potential energy
- When the wave appears to have no wave motion (looks like a flat line), all of its energy is in kinetic energy
### Comparing progressive waves and stationary waves
|Property|Progressive waves|Stationary waves|
|-|-|-|
|Amplitude|Amplitude is the same for all the particles in the path of the wave|Amplitude varies according to positions, from zero to the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes|
|Frequency|All particles oscillate at the same frequency|All particles oscillate at the same frequency except at the nodes|
|Wavelength|Wavelength is the distance between any 2 consecutive points on the waves that are in phase|Wavelength is 2 times the distance between a pair of adjacent nodes or antinodes|
|Phase|All particles within one wavelength have different phases|All particles within the same segment are in phase, particles in alternate segments are out of phase by $180 \degree$|
|Waveform|Propagates with the speed of the wave|No propagation of the wave profile|
|Energy|Energy is transmitted in the direction of travel of the wave|No transmission of energy, all energy is trapped in the vibratory motion of the stationary wave|
## Reflection from free and fixed ends
### Reflection from a fixed end
- When an incident wave pulse arrives at a fixed end, e.g. the end of a rope that is fastened to a rigid support so that the end point of the rope can't move
- The arriving wave pulse will exert a force on the fixed end 
- By newton's third law, the support will exert an equal but opposite force on the pulse
- Hence the reflected pulse will be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The reflected pulse will be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The reflected pulse suffers a phase change of $180 \degree$
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere destructively at the fixed end to produce a node
- E.g. Rope at a fixed end, Sound reflected from the closed end of a pipe, Microwave reflected by a metal plate
### Reflection from a free end
- When a wave pulse arrives at a free end, for example, when the end of the rope is looped around a vertical pole, the end point of the rope is free to move
- Hence the reflected pulse will not be inverted with respect to the incoming pluse
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere constructively at the free end to produce an anti-node
- E.g. Rope looped around a vertical pole, Sound reflected from the open end of a pipe
![[reflection from free and fixed ends.gif]]
## Experiments to demonstrate stationary waves
### Stretched strings fixed at both ends
- A continuous wave train of fixed frequency can be produced by plucking one end of a stretched spring fixed at both end with a specific tension
- When the wave train reaches the fixed end of the the string, reflected waves travelling in opposite directions will overlap and superpose or interfere with the incident waves
- This interference produces a transverse stationary wave in the string, which appears to vibrate transversely as a whole, with no sign of propagation of the wave profile
- Depending on where the string is plucked, many various modes of vibrations can result
![[modes of streched string.png]]
- Each mode corresponds to the number of loops
- The same reasoning can be extended to deal with higher overtones that can exist on the same string
- There are an infinite number of overtones
### Longitudinal stationary waves in sound
- The incident sound waves are produced by a signal generator of known frequency through a loud speaker
- These incident waves are reflected by a smooth plane reflector
- The two wave trains will superpose to give stationary waves
- The detection of the nodes and and its antinodes of the stationary wave can be done by using  a microphone attached to the C.R.O with a suitable time base setting
- By shifting the position the microphone along the line between the loudspeaker and reflector, the trace on the CRO is seen to vary from minimum (e.g. at position 2) to maximum (e.g. position 1 and 3)
- This shows us the nodal and anti-nodal regions of the stationary sound waves
- We can also find the velocity of the sound waves
	- The distance between two nodes/ two antinodes is half a wavelength
	- The period of the soundwave can be obtained form the CRO
	- We can then find frequency adn use $v = f\lambda$ 
- A similar set up can be sued for microwaves or any other EM waves, with the appropriate transmitter and detector
- Sound source -> Microwave source, Microphone -> Microwave detector -> Smooth reflector -> Smooth metal plate
### Longitudinal stationary waves in air columns
#### Close pipe
![[closed pipe.png]]
- The particles at the closed end cannot virbate at all as there is no room to vibrate
![[closed pipe modes.png]]
- There is no 2nd/ 4th harmonics as it does not exist for a closed pope
- There are only odd harmonics, no even
#### Open pipe
![[open pipe.png]]
![[open pipe modes.png]]
- It can have all the harmonics
#### Kundt's tube
![[kundt's tube.png]]
- The bottom of the Kundt's tube is coated with light cork powder
- The speaker is used to transmit sound waves into the Kundt's tube
- The source wave is reflected off the closed end, and interferes with the incoming wave to form a stationary wave
- The light cork power gets agitated, and settles at the nodes
- The distance between adjacent heaps of power is half a wave length
- The greatest change in pressure isa at the nodes, as it changes from a compression to a rarefaction in half a period
## Diffraction
- ==Diffraction refers to the spreading or bending of plane waves when the encounter an aperture or obstacle, whose linear dimension is comparable to the wavelength of the wave==
- Sound waves can spread or bend around corners
- Light waves can spread around small object or aperture
- Water waves can spread around aperture
>[!NOTE]
>For diffraction to occur, the wavelength of the wave should be comparable to the size of the aperture.
>As the wavelength of the light is relatively small compared to the sizes of the obstacles it faces, it cannot bend around corners
## Experiments to demonstrate diffraction
### Using a ripple tank
- A ripple tank with a plane vibrator is sued to generate plane waves
- Apertures of different size relative to the wavelength of the waves are sued to obstruct the progress of the waves
![[diffraction.png]]
- Note that when drawing this, the wavelength after passing through the aperture remains the same as the wavefront before
- The smaller the aperture is relative to the wavelength, the greater the amount of spreading/ of the incident plane waves
### Using a laser beam
- An opaque slide with a fine rectangular slit (of several wavelengths in slit width is placed in front of a laser beam
- The transmitted light falling on a distant screen shows the illumination of the screen goes beyond the geometrical size of the slit
- I.e. the light beam spreads after passing through the slit
![[single slit.png]]
#### Angle of deviation of the first minimum (dark fringe)
![[angle of deviation for first minimum.png]]
- The angle $\theta$ subtended by the straight through position adn the line form the single slit to the first minimum is called the angle of deviation of the first minimum
- $\theta$ is given by$$sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- $\theta$: Angle of deviation of the first minimum, $\lambda$: Wavelength, $a$: width of slit
- Usually $\theta$ is small, so $sin\theta \approx \theta$, and so $\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{a}$
### Resolution of a single slit
- The ability of an optical systems to distinguish closely spaced spaced object is limited because of diffraction and interference
- Consider two light sources S1 and S2, far from each other and the viewing screen
![[resolution of single slit.jpg]]
- If little to no interference occurred between the light passing through different parts of the slit, two distinct bright sports would appear on the viewing screen
- If the two sources are close together, diffraction patterns will overlap and images are not distinguishable
- ==Rayleigh's criterion is when the **central maximum (central bright fringe of S1)** of one image falls on the **first minimum (first dark fringe of S2)** of another image, and the images are just resolved==
- The angular separation $\theta$ of the two sources of the light at the single slit satisfies $$sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
>[!NOTE]
>From single slit diffraction, the equation for the first minimum is also $sin\theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$
- This expression gives the smallest angular separation for which the two images are resolved
- Because $\lambda << a$ in most situation, $sin \theta$ is small and we can use the approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$
- Therefore, the limiting angle of resolution is $$\theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- $\theta$ has to be in radians
- For the images to be observed, the angle subtended by the two sources must be grater than $\frac {\lambda}{a}$ if you want to see the images
![[rayleighs criteron.png]]
## Interference of coherent sources of waves
### Conditions for producing steady observable interference
- ==The waves must be coherent (i.e. they have a constant phase difference)==
- This implies they have the same frequency and wavelength, and they maintain a constant phase relation with each other
- E.g. Two loudspeakers fed from the same signal generator, oscillations of two simple pendulums of the same length
- Otherwise, interference patterns change so fast they are hard to detect
- ==They must have roughly the same amplitude==
![[amplitude for observable inteference.png]]
- If one of the waves has an amplitude which is much larger than that of the other wave, that even if destructive interference occurs, the amplitude of the resulting wave will not be zero
- Hence, no dark fringes will be seen
- The contrast between the light and dark fringes may be so slight that the interference pattern is not visible

- ==For transverse waves, they must be polarised in the same plane or unpolarised==
- If waves emerging from the two sources have polarisation directions which are perpendicular to each other, then the two waves will not interfere with each other
- They will instead simply mix together, with no superposition taking place, and so no interference pattern is produced
- ==The light source must be monochromatic (one colour/ same wavelength)==
- A normal light bulb which emits a range of frequencies of light (infrared to visible light to ultraviolet) cannot be used
- Instead, a light source which is able to emit light of very exact wavelengths such as a sodium lamp or mercury lamp must be used
### Condition for constructive interference (maxima)
- Two waves that satisfy the above criteria can meet and interfere to give regions of maxima or minima
- Let two waves from sources S1 and S2 meet and interfere at P
- S1 and S2 are two wave sources that are coherent and in phase
![[constructive inteference.png]]
- If $S_1P = S_2P$, the waves will meet at P in phase and a maximum will be obtained at P
- Path difference: $S_1P - S2_P = 0$
- A maximum is also obtained when $S_2P - S_1P = 1\lambda$
- A maximum is obtained when
	- Path difference: $1\lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda, ...$
	- Phase difference: $2\pi, 4\pi, 6\pi, ...$
![[constructive inteference results.png]]
### Condition for destructive interference (minima)
- If the path difference of $S_2P - S_1P = \frac{1}{2}\lambda$, the waves will meet a P out pf phase and a minimum will be produced
- A minimum is obtained when
	- Path difference: $\frac{1}{2}\lambda,\frac{3}{2}\lambda,\frac{5}{2}\lambda,...$
	- Phase difference: $1\pi, 3pi, 5\pi ...$
![[destructive inteference results.png]]
## Experiments of two source interferences
### Ripples
- Using a ripple tank with two dippers  controlled by the same vibrator frequency, two sets of coherent ripples can be established
- The ripples overlap so that there is interference
![[two source interference ripple.png]]
- The is constructive interference when a crest meets a crest, or a through meets a trough
- There is destructive interference when a through meets a crest
### Double slit experiment
![[double slit.png]]
- A single fine slit S is called the source slit
- This is necessary as it limits the light waves reaching S1 and S2 to a tiny part of the light source, making the waves coherent
- Alternatively, the light source and slit S can be replaced with a laser beam that is shown perpendicularly onto S1 and S2, as the light waves from a laser beam are already coherent
- Light coming out from each slit will spread (diffract) so that they will overlap and interfere
- A screen or focal plane allows us to form and observe alternate bright and dark fringes
#### Equation for angle of deviation of nth bright fringe
![[equation for nth bright fringe.png]]
- $d$ is much smaller than $D$ and $S_1P$ and $S_2P$ are almost parallel
- The path difference from $S_1$ to $P$ and $S_2$ to $P$ is $S_1P - S_2P = dsin\theta$
- For constructive interference, $dsin\theta = n\lambda, n = 0,1,2,3,...$
- $\angle AS_1S_2 = \angle = \angle PBO$ (rotate the double fringe to see)
- From $\triangle OBP$, $tan \theta = \frac{OP}{OB} = \frac{y_n}{D}$
- SInce $\theta$ is so small due to $D >> d$ , $tan\theta \approx sin\theta$
- Therefore, $d(\tan\theta) = n \lambda$
- Subbing in t$an \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$, $d(\frac{y_n}{D}) = n\lambda$
- Thus, $$y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
- $y_n$: Distance between central bright fringe and nth bright fringe, $n$: order of bright fringe, $\lambda$: wavelength, $D$: Distance from slit to screen, $d$: slit separation
#### Equation for fringe separation of two bright fringes
![[fringe seperation.png]]
- For fringe separation, $\Delta y$, between  two bright fringes, 
$$\Delta y = \frac{(n+1)\lambda D}{d} - \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
$$\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$
#### Intensity distribution of the inteference fringes
- The even or regular intensity distribution is obtained only if the slit width of the double slits is equal to one wavelength
![[realtive intensity when d is one wavelenght.png]]
- However, this is usually not the case and the relative intensity of the fringes is as shown
![[relative intensity in reality.png]]
- The unequal intensities of light on the bright fringes is due to the diffraction effect that occurs when light gets diffracted by each of the double slits
#### Energy considerations of interference
- Let the waves from $S_1$ and $S_2$ be each of amplitude $A$
- The intensity of each wave is $\propto A^2$ ($I \propto A^2$)
- Hence, the total intensity of the two waves should be $\propto A^2$ (Intensity of $S_1$ + intensity of $S_2$: $A^2 + A^2$)
- At position of maxima (waves interfere constructively to give a wave of amplitude $2A$), $I\propto (2A)^2 \rightarrow I \propto 4A^2$
- At positions of minima (waves interfere destructively to give a wave of zero amplitude), $I = 0$
- Hence, the average intensity $\propto 2A^2$
- The law of conservation of energy is not violated, the effect of interference simply redistributes the energy to the bright fringes (maxima) with higher intensity and reducing that at dark fringes (minima)
## Diffraction grating
![[diffraction grating.png]]
- Another alternative set up is as shown bellow
![[diffraction grating alternative.png]]
### Equation for distance between two slits
- If the grating has a specification of $N$ lines per mm, then$$d = \frac{1}{N}mm = \frac{1}{N} \times 10^{-3} m$$
- $d$: Distance between two slits, $N$: number of slits,
### Equation for path difference
![[angle of deviation diffraction grating.png]]
- When the wavelets moving in a particular direction interfere constructively, the path difference from adjacent wavelets is
$$Path\ difference\ = BX = dsin\theta= n\lambda$$
- Therefore,$$dsin\theta= n\lambda$$
- $d$: Distance between two slits, $\theta$: Angle of deviation form the nth  order maximum to the straight through, $\lambda$: wavelength, $n$: order of the bright fringe being considered
### Equations for angular separation
- When n = 1 and 2,$$n = 1, dsin\theta_1 = \lambda$$ $$n = 2, dsin\theta_2 = 2\lambda$$
- Angular separation between the first and second orders of the spectrum: $$\Delta \theta =  sin^{-1}\frac{2\lambda}{d} - sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}$$
- If $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are small, then $sin\theta \approx \theta$$$\Delta \theta =  \frac{2\lambda}{d} - \frac{\lambda}{d} = \frac{\lambda}{d}$$
### Maximum order of diffraction observable
- Since, $\theta \le 90\degree$, $dsin\theta= n\lambda \rightarrow sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d} \le 1$
- Hence, $$n_{max} \le \frac{d}{\lambda}$$
>[!NOTE]
>We cant use $y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$ or $\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$, as we cannot assume that $\theta$ is small
>To find $y_n$, first use $sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{D}, then use $tan \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$

## Angular dispersion of white light
- If light consisting of a range of wavelengths is used, they would be separated after passing through the grating (i.e. dispersion)
- This will give rise to the colour spectrum of the light source
- The shortest wavelength (e.g. violet) will be diffracted least.
![[angular dispersion of white light.png]]
- We can use $dsin\theta= n\lambda$
