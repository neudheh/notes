- Interference refers to the phenomenon of two or more waves of the same kind meeting at a point in space to produce a resultant wave disturbance 
- The resultant wave disturbance is given by the superposition of individual waves at that point
- ==The principle of superposition states that the resultant wave displacement is given by the vectorial sum of the individual displacement where the waves meet==
- Constructive interference occurs when the waves are meeting in phase
- The amplitude of the resultant waves is given by the sum of the amplitude of each individual wave
- Destructive interference occurs when the waves meet out of phase by $180\degree$
- The amplitude of the resultant wave is zero

## Stationary waves
- ==Stationary waves are formed by the interference of two waves that are of the same type, frequency (hence same wave speed and wavelength), amplitude, and travelling exactly in the opposite directions crossing each other==
![[stationary waves.gif]]
![[stationary wave.png]]
### Properties
![[stationary waves diagram.png]]
- The resultant wave profile shows no sign of progression in any direction (they do not travel left/ right)
- Individual particles are executing simple harmonic motion with the same frequency except at the nodes
- The amplitude of vibration varies from zero at the nodes, to a maximum at the antinodes
- The wave is divided into a number of segments or loops by the pattern of nodes and antinodes
- All particles in the same segment or loop are vibrating in phase, but particles in adjacent segments or loops are exactly $180\degree$ with one another 
- Consecutive noes and antinodes are half a wavelength apart
- Distance between a consecutive node and antinode is one quarter of a wavelength apart
- There is no transmission of energy along the progression of waves, all of the energy is trapped or contained within the stationary waves
### Comparing progressive and stationary waves
| Progressive waves                                                                            | Stationary waves                                                                                              |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amplitude is the same for all particles in the path of the wave                              | Amplitude varies according to positions, from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes                 |
| All particles oscillate at the same frequency                                                | All particles oscillate at the same frequency except at the antinodes                                         |
| One wave length is the distance between two consecutive points in the wave that are in phase | The wavelength is the distance between a pair or adjacent nodes or antinodes                                  |
| All points within one wavelength have different phases                                       | All points in the same segment are in phase, particles in alternate segments are out of phase by $180\degree$ |
| The waveform propagates with the speed of the wave                                           | No propogation of the wave profile                                                                            |
| Energy is transmitted in the direction of the travel of the wave                             | No transmission of energy - energy is retained within vibratory motion of the wave                            |
### Reflection from free and fixed ends
**Fixed end**
- E.g. the end of a rope that is fastened to a rigid support so that the rope cannot move
- When an incident wave pulse arrives at a fixed end, the wave pulse will exert a force on the fixed end
- By newton's third law, the support will exert an equal but opposite force, on the pulse
- The reflected pulse will be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The reflected pulse suffers a phase change of $180\degree$
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere destructively at the fixed end to produce a node
**Free end**
- E.g. end of a rope that is loped around a vertical pole
- When a wave pulse arrives at a free end, the end point of the rope is free to move
- The reflected pulse will not be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere constructively at the free end to produce an antinode
![[reflection from free and fixed ends.gif]]
## Experiments to demonstrate stationary waves
- A continuous wave train of fixed frequency can be produced by plucking one end of a stretched spring fixed at both ends with a specific tension
- When the wave train reaches the end of the fixed string, reflected wave travelling in the opposite direction will overlap and superpose or interfere with the incident waves
- The interference produces transverse stationary waves in the string which appears to vibrate transversely as a whole, with no sign of propagation of the wave profile
- Depending on where the string is plucked many various modes of vibrations can result
![[modes of streched string.png]]
### Longitudinal stationary wave in sound
- The incident sound waves are produced by a signal generator of known frequency through a loudspeaker
- The incident waves are reflected by a smooth plane reflector and the two wave trains will superpose to give a stationary wave
- The detection of nodes and anti node of the stationary wave can be done by a microphone attached a CRO with a suitable time-base settings
![[longitudinal stationary wave in sound.png]]
- By shifting the microphone along the line between the loudspeaker and reflector, the trace on the CRO is seen to vary from minimum at position 2 to a maximum at position 1
- We can measure the velocity, by measuring the distance from a node to a node, which is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$
- The period $T$ of the sound wave can be obtained from the CRO display, and its time-base setting
- This allows for the frequency to be found
- Hence, we can us $v=f\lambda$ to find the speed of sound
### Stationary waves in closed pipe
![[closed pipe.png]]
- The particles at the closed end cannot vibrate at all as there is no room to vibrate
![[closed pipe modes.png]]
- There is no 2nd/ 4th harmonics as it does not exist for a close pipe
- There are only odd harmonics, no even
### Stationary waves in open pipe
![[open pipe.png]]
![[open pipe modes.png]]
- It can have both odd and even harmonics
### Kundt's tube
![[kundt's tube.png]]
- The bottom of Kundt's tube is coated with light cork powder
- The speaker is used to transmit sound waves into the tube
- The sound waves reflect off the closed end, and interfere with the oncoming waves to form a stationary wave
- The light cork powered gets agitated and settles at the nodes
- The distance between adjacent heaps of power is half a wavelength
## Diffraction
- ==Diffraction refers to the spreading or bending or bending of plane waves when they encounter an aperture or obstacle, whose linear dimension is comparable to the wavelength of the wave==
- E.g. sound waves can spread or bend around corners, light waves can spread around small corners or apertures, water waves can spread around apertures
## Experiments to demonstrate diffraction
### Ripple tank
- A ripple tank with a plane vibrator is used to generate plane waves
- Apertures of different sizes relative to the wavelength of waves are used to obstruct the progress of plane waves
![[diffraction.png]]
- Notice when that drawing this, the wavelength remains the same after passing through the aperture as the wavefront before
- The smaller the aperture is relative to the wavelength, the greater the amount of spreading/ diffraction of the incident plane waves
### Laser beam
- An opaque slide with a fine rectangular slit of several wavelengths in slit width is placed in front of the laser beam
- The transmitted light falls on a distant screen shows the illumination of the screen goes beyond the geometrical size of the slit
- The light beam spreads after passing through the slit
![[single slit.png]]
#### Angle of deviation of the first minimum
- The angle subtended by the straight-through position, and the line from the single slit to the first minimum is called the angle deviation of the first minimum $$\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$: Angle of deviation of the first minimum ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: width of the slit ($m$)
#### Resolution of single slit
- The ability of an optical system to distinguish between closely spaced objects is limited because of diffraction and interference
- Consider two light sources S1 and S2
![[resolution of single slit.jpg]]
- If two sources are close together the diffractions patterns will overlap and images are not distinguishable
- ==When the central maximum of one images falls on the first minimum of another image, the images are just resolved, and the limiting resolution is known as Rayleigh's criterion==$$\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$: Angle between the two sources ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: width of the slit ($m$)
- Because $\lambda << a$ in most situations, $\sin \theta$ is small and we can use the approximation $sin \theta = \theta$
- Therefore the limiting angle of resolution is$$\theta _{min}=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$: Angle between the two sources ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: width of the slit ($m$)\
- The angle subtended by the two sources at the slit must be greater than $\frac{\lambda}{a}$ if the images are to be observed
![[rayleighs criteron.png]]
## Conditions for producing steady observable interference
**The sources of waves must be coherent (have a constant phase difference)**
- This implies that they have the same frequency, wavelength and maintain a constant phase difference with each other
- E.g. two loudspeakers fed from the same signal generator, two oscillations of two simple pendulums of the same length
**They must have roughly the same amplitude**
- If one of the waves has an amplitude that is much larger than that of the other, even if destructive interference occurs, the amplitude of the resultant wave will not be zero
- Hence, no dark fringes will be seen, and the contrast between the bright and dark fringes may be so slight so that the interference pattern is not visible
![[amplitude for observable inteference.png]]
**For transverse waves, they must be polarised in the same plane, or unpolarised**
- If the waves have polarisation directions that are perpendicular to each other, the two waves will not interfere with each other
- Instead, they will simply mix together, with no superposition taking place, and no interference pattern is produced
**The light source must be monochromatic**
- A normal light bulb which emits a continuous range of frequencies of light (from infrared to visible to ultraviolet) cannot be used
- A light source that is able to emit light of very exact wavelengths such as a sodium lamp or mercury lamp must be used
### Constructive interference (maxima)
![[constructive inteference.png]]
- Let two waves from sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ meet and interfere at $P$, and $S_1$ and $S_2$ are coherent and in phase
- If the distance from $S_1$ to $P$ is the same as the distance from $S_2$ to $P$, they will meet at $P$ in phase, and a maximum will be produced
- Path difference $S_2P - S_1P = 0$
- A maximum is also produced when Path difference $S_2P - S_1P = 1\lambda$
- In general, a maximum is obtained when $$Path\ difference = 1\lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda...$$$$Phase\ difference = 2\pi, 4\pi, 6\pi ...$$
![[constructive inteference results.png]]
### Destructive interference (minima)
![[destructive interference.png]]
- Let two waves from sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ meet and interfere at $P$, and $S_1$ and $S_2$ are coherent and in phase
- If the distance from $S_1$ to $P$ is $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$ different the distance from $S_2$ to $P$, they will meet at $P$ out of phase, and a minimum will be produced
- A minimum is also obtained when the path difference $S_1P - S_2P = \frac{3}{2}\lambda$
- In general, a minimum is obtained when $$Path\ difference = \frac{1}{2}\lambda, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \frac{5}{2}\lambda$$$$Phase\ differemce = \pi, 3\pi, 5\pi$$
![[destructive inteference results.png]]
## Two-source interference using ripples
- Using a ripple tank with two dippers controlled by the same vibrator frequency, two sets of coherent ripples can be established and allowed to overlap\
- The interference results will be as below
![[two source interference ripple.png]]
## Young's double slit experiment
![[double slit.png]]
- A single fine slit called the source slit is needed because it limits the light waves reaching $S_1$ and $S_2$ to a tiny part of the light source, making the waves coherent
- Alternatively, the light source and the source slit can be replaced with a laser beam that is shone perpendicularly on the two slits
- This is because the light waves in the laser beam are already coherent
- The light coming from each slit will spread (diffract) so that they will overlap and interfere
- A screen or focal plane on which alternate bright and dark interference fringes are formed and observed
### Equation for nth bright fringe
![[equation for nth bright fringe.png]]
- The path difference from $S_1$ and $S_2$ to $P$ is $S_2A = d\sin\theta$
- For constructive interference, $d\sin\theta=n\lambda$, where $n = 0,1,2,3 ...$
- From $\Delta OBP$, $\tan\theta = \frac{OP}{OB} = \frac{y_n}{D}$
- Since $\theta$ is very small due to $d << D$, $tan\theta\approx\sin\theta$
- Therefore, $\tan\theta=\frac{n\lambda}{d}$
- Subbing in $\tan\theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$, $$y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
- Where $y_n$: Deviation of nth bright fringe from central maximum ($m$), $\lambda$: wavelength ($m$), $d$: slit separation ($m$), $D$: distance from screen to the fringe ($m$)
### Fringe seperation
![[fringe seperation.png]]
- The fringe spacing $\Delta y$ between adjacent bright fringes is given by $$\Delta y = y_{n+1} - y_n = \frac{(n+1)\lambda D}{d} - \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
- Therefore, $$\Delta y= \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$
- Where $\Delta y$: Fringe separation ($m$), $\lambda$: wavelength ($m$), $d$: separation separation ($m$), $D$: distance from screen to the fringe ($m$)
### Intensity distribution
- The even or regular intensity distribution of the fringes is obtained only if the width of the double slits is equal to one wavelength
![[realtive intensity when d is one wavelenght.png]]
- In practise this is usually not the case, and the relative intensity of the fringes is as shown
![[relative intensity in reality.png]]
- The unequal intensities of the bright fringes is due to diffraction effect that occurs when the light gets diffracted by each of the double slits
- Let the waves from $S_1$ and $S_2$ be $A$
- Intensity of each wave $\propto A^2$
- Total intensity of two waves $\propto A^2$
- At positions of maxima, $I \propto (2A^2) = 4A^2$
- At positions of minima, intensity = 0
- Hence, the average intensity is $2A^2$
- Thus the law of conservation of energy is not violated
- Interference simply redistributes energy to the bright fringes (maxima) with higher intensity and reducing that at the dark fringes (minima)
## Diffraction grating
![[diffraction grating.png]]
![[diffraction grating alternative.png]]
### Equation for distance between two slits
- If the grating has a specification of $N$ lines per mm, then $$d = \frac{1\times10^-3}{N}$$
- Where $d$: slit separation ($m$), $N$: number of fringes per mm
### Equation for diffraction grating
![[angle of deviation diffraction grating.png]]
- When the waves moving in a particular direction interfere constructively, the path difference between each individual wave is $n\lambda$, where $n = 1,2,3 ...$
- From $\Delta ABX$, $BX = d\sin\theta$, thus the diffraction equation is $$d\sin\theta = n\lambda$$
- Where $d$: Fringe separation ($m$), $\theta$: Angle of the nth order maximum from the straight-through direction ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
### Equation for angular separation
- When $n$ = 1 or 2, $$n=1: d\sin\theta_1 = \lambda$$$$n=2: d\sin\theta_2 = 2\lambda$$
- Therefore, $$\sin \theta_1 = \frac{\lambda}{d}, \sin \theta_2 = \frac{2\lambda}{d}$$
- Angular seperation $$\Delta \theta = \theta_2 - \theta_1 = \sin^{-1}\frac{2\lambda}{d} - \sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}$$
- If $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are small enough (which are they are usually not), $\sin \theta \approx \theta$ $$\Delta \theta = \frac{2\lambda}{d} - \frac{\lambda}{d} = \frac{\lambda}{d}$$
- Where $\theta$: Angle of the nth order maximum from the straight-through direction ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $d$: slit separation
### Maximum order of diffraction observable
- For the maximum order of diffraction observable, $\theta \leq 90\degree$
- Since $d\sin\theta=n\lambda$, $\sin\theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d} \leq 1$
- Thus, $$n_{max} \leq \frac{d}{\lambda}$$
- Where $n_{max}$: maximum order, $d$: Fringe separation ($m$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)

>[!NOTE]
>We cant use $y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$ or $\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$, as we cannot assume that $\theta$ is small
>To find $y_n$, first use $sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{D}$, then use $tan \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$
### Angular dispersion of white light
- If light consisting of a range of wavelengths is used, they would be separated after passing through the grating (i.e. dispersion)
- This will give rise to the colour spectrum of the light source
- The shortest wavelength (e.g. violet) will be diffracted least.
![[angular dispersion of white light.png]]
- We can use $dsin\theta= n\lambda$
