## Principle of super position
- Interference refers to the phenomenon of two or more waves of the same kind meeting at a point in space to produce a resultant wave disturbance given by the superposition of individual waves at that point
- ==The principle of superposition states that the resultant wave displacement is given by the vectorial sum of the individual wave displacements at the point where the waves meet==
- The waves have to be added vectorially
![[constructive and destructive inteference.png]]
- Constructive interference occurs when waves are meeting in phase
- The amplitude of the resultant wave is the sum of the individual amplitudes of each of the waves
- Destructive interference occurs when waves are meeting out of phase (180ยบ)
- The amplitude of the resultant wave is zero
## Stationary waves
- Stationary waves are formed from the interference of two waves
	- that are of the same frequency (hence same wave speed and wavelength)
	- same amplitude
	- travelling exactly in opposite directions crossing each other
![[stationary waves.gif]]
![[stationary wave.png]]
### Properties
![[stationary waves diagram.png]]
- The resultant wave profile shows no sign of progression in any direction
- individual particles are executing simple harmonic oscillations with the same frequency except at the nodes
- The amplitude of vibration varies from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the anti-nodes
- The wave is divided into a number of segments or loops by a pattern of nodes or anti-nodes
- All particles in the same segment are vibrating in phase, but particles in adjacent segments are exactly 180ยบ out of phase with one another
- Consecutive nodes or anti-nodes are half a wavelength apart ($\frac{1}{2}\lambda$)
- Distance between a consecutive node and anti-node is one-quarter of a wavelength apart ($\frac{1}{4}\lambda$)
- Unlike progressive waves, there is no transmission of energy along the progression of waves, all of the energy is contained within the stationary wave
### Comparing stationary waves with progressive waves
| Progressive waves                                                                   | Stationary waves                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amplitude is the same for all the particles in the wave                             | Amplitude varies according to position, from zero at the node to a maximum at the anti-nodes              |
| All particles oscillate at the same frequency                                       | All particles oscillate at the same frequency except at the nodes                                         |
| The wavelength is the distance between any two consecutive points that are in phase | The wave length is 2 times the distance between a pari of adjacent nodes or anti-nodes                    |
| All particles within one wavelength have different phases                           | All particles in the same segment are in phase, particles in alterrnate segments are out of phase by 180ยบ |
| Waveform propagates with the speed of the wave                                      | No propagation of the wave profile                                                                        |
| Energy is transmitted in the direction of travel of the wave                        | No transmission of energy - energy is trapped or contained within the wave                                |
## Reflection from free and fixed ends
### Reflection from a fixed end
- E.g. Rope at a fixed end, Sound reflected from the closed end of a pipe, Microwave reflected by a metal plate
- When an incident wave pulse arrives at a fixed end, the arriving wave pulse will exert a force on the fixed end
- By newton's third law, the support will exert an equal but opposite force on the pulse
- Hence, the reflected pulse will be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The reflected pulse suffers a phase change of 180ยบ
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere destructively at the fixed end to produce a node
### Reflection from a free end
- E.g. Rope looped around a vertical pole, sound reflected from the open end of a pipe
- When a wave pulse arrives at a free end, the end point of a rope is free to move
- Hence, the reflected pulse will not be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere constructively at the free end to produce an anti-node
![[reflection from free and fixed ends.gif]]
## Experiments to demonstrate stationary waves
### Stretched strings fixed at both ends
- A continuous wave train of fixed frequency can be produced by plucking one end of a stretched string fixed at both ends with a specific tension
- When the wave train reaches the fixed end of the string, reflected waves travelling in opposite directions will overlap and superpose or interfere with the incident waves
- The interference produces transverse stationary waves in the string which appears to vibrate transversely as a while, with no sign of propagation of the wave profile
- Depending on where the string is plucked, many modes of vibration can result
![[modes of streched string.png]]
### Longitudinal stationary waves in sound
- The incident sound waves are produced by a signal generator of known frequency through a loudspeaker
- These incident waves are reflected by a smooth plane reflector and the two wave-trains will superpose to give a stationary wave
- The detection of the nodes and and its antinodes of the stationary wave can be done by using a microphone attached to the C.R.O with a suitable time base setting
![[longitudinal stationary wave in sound.png]]
- By shifting the position of the microphone along the line between the loudspeaker and reflector, the trace on the CRO is seen varying from minimum (e.g. at position 2) to maximum (e.g. position 1 and 3)
- This shows us the nodal and antinodal regions of the sound wave
- We can find the velocity of the sound waves
	- The distance between two consecutive nodes/ antinodes, which is equal to half a wavelength
	- The period can be obtained from the CRO display on the time-base setting
	- We can thus find the frequency, and the wave speed by using $v = f\lambda$
### Longitudinal stationary waves in air columns
#### Close pipe
![[closed pipe.png]]
- The particles at the closed end cannot vibrate at all as there is no room to vibrate
![[closed pipe modes.png]]
- There is no 2nd/ 4th harmonics as it does not exist for a close pipe
- There are only odd harmonics, no even
#### Open pipe
![[open pipe.png]]
![[open pipe modes.png]]
- It can have both odd and even harmonics
#### Kundt's tube
![[kundt's tube.png]]
- The bottom of Kundt's tube is coated with light cork powder
- The speaker is used to transmit sound waves into Kundt's tube
- The sound waves reflect off the closed end, and interfere with the incoming wave to form a stationary wave
- The light cork powder gets agitated, and settles at the nodes
- The distance between adjacent heaps of powder is half a wavelength
- The greatest change of pressure is at the antinodes as it changes form a compression to a rarefaction, while there is no pressure change at the nodes
## Diffraction
- ==Diffractions refers to the spreading of plane waves when the encounter an aperture or obstacle, whose linear dimension is comparable to the wavelength of the waves==
- Sound waves can spread or bend around corners
- Light waves can spread around small obstacles or apertures
- Water waves can spread around apertures
>[!NOTE]
>For diffraction to occur, the wavelength of the wave should be comparable to the size of the aperture.
>As the wavelength of the light is relatively small compared to the sizes of the obstacles it faces, it cannot bend around corners
## Experiments to demonstrate diffraction
### Using a ripple tank
- A ripple tank with a plane vibrator is used to generate plane wave
- Apertures of different sizes relative to the wavelength of waves are used to obstruct the progress of the plane waves
![[diffraction.png]]
- Notice that when drawing this, the wavelength remains the same after passing through the aperture as the wavefront before
- The smaller the aperture is relative to the wave length, the greater the amount of spreading/ diffraction of the incident plane waves
### Using a laser beam
- An opaque slide with a fine rectangular slit (of several wavelengths in slit width) is place in front of a laser beam
- The transmitted light falling on a distant screen shows that the illumination of the screen goes beyond the geometrical size of the slit 
- I.e. the light beam spreads after passing through the slit
![[single slit.png]]
#### Angle of deviation of the first minimum (dark fringe)
![[angle of deviation for first minimum.png]]
- The angle $\theta$ subtended by the straight through position and the line from the single slit to the first minimum is called the angle of deviation of the first minimum
$$\sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$ = Angle between straight through and first minimum ($rad$),$\lambda$ = Wavelength ($m$), $a$ = width of the slit ($m$) 
### Resolution of a single slit
-  The ability of optical systems to distinguish between closely spaced objects is limited because of diffraction
- Consider two light sources S1 and S2
![[resolution of single slit.jpg]]
- If little to no interference occured between light passing through different parts of the slit, two distinct bright spots or images would be observed on the viewing screen
- If the two sources are close together, the diffraction patterns will overlap and images are not distinguishable
- When images are just resolved, the central maximum of one image falls on the first minimum of another image
- This is known as Rayleigh's criterion

$$\sin \theta = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$ = angular seperation of the two sources of light at the single slit ($rad$),$\lambda$ = Wavelength ($m$), $a$ = width of the slit ($m$) 
- As $\lambda << a$ in most situations, $\sin \theta$ is small, and we can use the approximation $\sin \theta \approx \theta$
- Therefore, the limiting angle of resolution for slit width $a$ is $$\theta _{min} = \frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- Where $\theta$ = angular seperation of the two sources of light at the single slit ($rad$),$\lambda$ = Wavelength ($m$), $a$ = width of the slit ($m$) 
- The angle subtended by the two sources at the slit must be greater than $\frac{\lambda}{a}$ if the images are to be observed
![[rayleighs criteron.png]]
## Interference of coherent sources of waves
### Conditions for producing steady observable interference
- ==The sources of waves must be coherent (i.e. they have a constant phase difference)==
	- This implies that they have the same frequency and wavelength and maintain a constant phase relation with each other
	- E.g. Two loud speakers fed from the same signal generator, oscillations of two pendulums of the same wavelength
- ==The must have roughly the same amplitude==
	- If one of the waves has an amplitude that is much large than that of the other wave, even if destructive interference occurs, the amplitude of the resulting wave will not be zero ![[amplitude for observable inteference.png]]
	- No dark fringes will not be seen and the interference pattern is not visible as the contrast between light and dark fringes is so slight
- ==For transverse waves, they must be polarised in the same plane or unpolarised==
	- If the waves emerging from the two source have polarisation directions that are polarised to each other, no interference occurs
	- Instead, they will simply mix together, with no superposition taking place, hence no interference is observed
- ==The light source must be monochromatic==
	- A normal lightbulb which emits a range of frequencies of light cannot be used
	- It is best to use a light which is able to emit light of exact wavelengths like a sodium or mercury lamp
- Two waves that satisfy the above criteria and meet at a point in space can interfere to give regions of maxima and minima
### Condition for constructive interference (maxima)

- Let two wave sources from sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ meet and interfere at P, and $S_1$ and $S_2$ are two wave sources that are coherent and in phase![[constructive inteference.png]]
- If distance from $S_1$ to $P$ = distance form $S_2$ to $P$, they will meet on phase, and a maximum will be obtained
- Path difference = $S_2P - S_1P = 0$
- A maximum is also obtained when the path difference is equal to one wavelength
- A maximum is obtained when
	- Path difference = $1\lambda, 2\lambda, 3\lambda ...$
	- Phase differences = $2\pi, 4\pi, 6\pi$
![[constructive inteference results.png]]
### Condition for destructive interference (minima)
- Let two wave sources from sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ meet and interfere at P, and $S_1$ and $S_2$ are two wave sources that are coherent and in phase
- If the path difference = $\frac{1}{2}\lambda$, the waves will meet at P out of phase, and a minimum will be produced
- A minimum will be obtained when
	- Path difference = $\frac{1}{2} \lambda, \frac{3}{2} \lambda, \frac{5}{2} \lambda, ...$
	- Phase difference = $\pi, 3\pi, 5\pi...$
![[destructive inteference results.png]]
## Experiments of two source interferences
### Ripples
- Using a ripple tank with two dippers controlled by the same vibrator frequency, two sets of coherent ripples can be established
- The two ripples overlap so that there is interference
![[two source interference ripple.png]]
- There is constructive interference when a crest meets a crest, or a trough meets a trough
- There is destructive interferences when a trough meets a crest
### Double slit experiment
![[double slit.png]]
- A single fine slit S is called the source slit
- It limits the light waves reaching $S_1$ and $S_2$ to a tiny part of the light source, making the waves coherent
- Alternatively, the light source and the slit S can be replaced with a laser beam that is shone perpendicularly onto slits $S_1$ and $S_2$
- Light coming out from each slit will diffract so that they overlap and interfere
- A screen or focal plane on which alternate bright and dark interference fringes are formed and observed
#### Equation for angle of deviation of nth bright fringe
![[equation for nth bright fringe.png]]
- The path difference from $S_1$ to $S_2$ to P is $S_2P - S_1P = d \sin \theta$
- For constructive interference, $d \sin \theta = n\lambda, n = 0,1,2,3..$
- $\angle AS_1S_2 = \angle = \angle PBO$ (rotate the double fringe to see)
- From $\triangle OBP$, $\tan \theta = \frac{OP}{OB} = \frac{y_n}{D}$
- Since $\theta$ is very small as $d << D$, $\tan \theta \approx \sin \theta$
- Therefore, $d(\tan\theta) = n \lambda$
- Subbing in t$an \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$, $d(\frac{y_n}{D}) = n\lambda$
- Thus, $$y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
- $y_n$= Distance between central bright fringe and nth bright fringe ($m$), $n$=  order of bright fringe, $\lambda$= wavelength ($m$), $D$= Distance from slit to screen ($m$), $d$= slit separation ($m$)
#### Equation for fringe separation of two bright fringes

![[fringe seperation.png]]
- For fringe separation, $\Delta y$, between  two bright fringes, 
$$\Delta y = \frac{(n+1)\lambda D}{d} - \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
$$\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$
- $\Delta y$ = fringe separation ($m$), $\lambda$= wavelength ($m$), $D$= Distance from slit to screen ($m$), $d$= slit separation ($m$)
#### Intensity distribution of the interference fringes
- The even or regular intensity distribution of the fringes is obtained only of the slit width of the double slits is equal to one wavelength
![[realtive intensity when d is one wavelenght.png]]
- However, this is usually not the case and the relative intensity of the fringes is as shown
![[relative intensity in reality.png]]
- The unequal intensities of light on the bright fringes is due to the diffraction effect that occurs when light gets diffracted by each of the double slits
- Let the waves from $S_1$ and $S_2$ be each of amplitude $A$
- Intensity of each wave $\propto A^2$
- Total intensity of two waves $\propto 2A^2$
- At position of maxima, the intensity $\propto (2A)^2$ (i.e. $\propto 4A^2$)
- At points of minima, the intensity = 0
- Law of conservation of energy is not violated, the effect of interference simply redistributes the energy to the bright fringes (maxima) with higher intensity and reducing that at dark fringes (minima)
## Diffraction grating
![[diffraction grating.png]]
- Another alternative set up is as shown bellow
![[diffraction grating alternative.png]]
### Equation for distance between two slits
- If the grating has a specification of $N$ lines per mm, then$$d = \frac{1}{N}mm = \frac{1}{N} \times 10^{-3} m$$
- $d$: Distance between two slits, $N$: number of slits,
### Equation for path difference
![[angle of deviation diffraction grating.png]]
- When the wavelets moving in a particular direction interfere constructively, the path difference between adjacent wavelets (e.g. A and B) is $n\lambda$
- From $\triangle ABX$, $BX = d\sin \theta$
- Therefore,$$dsin\theta= n\lambda$$
- $d$ =  Distance between two slits ($m$), $\theta$ = Angle of deviation of the nth order maximum to the straight through ($rad$), $\lambda$= wavelength ($m$), $n$= order of the bright fringe being considered
### Equations for angular separation
- - When n = 1 and 2,$$n = 1, dsin\theta_1 = \lambda$$ $$n = 2, dsin\theta_2 = 2\lambda$$
- Angular separation between the first and second orders of the spectrum: $$\Delta \theta =  sin^{-1}\frac{2\lambda}{d} - sin^{-1}\frac{\lambda}{d}$$
- If $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are small (which they are usually not), then $sin\theta \approx \theta$$$\Delta \theta =  \frac{2\lambda}{d} - \frac{\lambda}{d} = \frac{\lambda}{d}$$
### Maximum order of diffraction observable
- For maximum order of diffraction possible, $\theta \leq 90ยบ$
- Since $d \sin \theta = n\lambda$, $\sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{d} \leq 1$
$$n_{max} = \frac{d}{\lambda}$$
- $d$ =  Distance between two slits ($m$), $\lambda$= wavelength ($m$), $n$= order of the bright fringe being considered
>[!NOTE]
>We cant use $y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$ or $\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$, as we cannot assume that $\theta$ is small
>To find $y_n$, first use $sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{D}$, then use $tan \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$
### Angular dispersion of white light
- If light consisting of a range of wavelengths is used, they would be separated after passing through the grating (i.e. dispersion)
- This will give rise to the colour spectrum of the light source
- The shortest wavelength (e.g. violet) will be diffracted least.
![[angular dispersion of white light.png]]
- We can use $dsin\theta= n\lambda$
