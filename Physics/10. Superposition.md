## Principle of superposition
- Interference refers the phenomenon of two or more waves of the same kind meeting at a point in space to produce a resultant wave disturbance given by the superposition of individual waves at that point
- ==The principle of superposition states that the resultant wave displacement is given by the vectorial sum of the individual wave displacement at the point where the waves meet==
- Waves have to be added vectorially
- Constructive interference occurs when waves are meeting in phase
- The amplitude of the resultant waves is the sum of the amplitude of each individual waves
- Destructive interference occurs when waves meet out of phase ($180 \degree$)
- The amplitude of the resultant wave is 0
## Stationary waves
- Stationary waves are from of the interference of two waves
	- of the same type
	- same frequency (hence same propagation speed and wavelength)
	- same amplitude
	- travelling in exactly opposite directions to each other

### Properties
- The resultant wave profile shows no sign of progression in either direction
- Individual particles are executing simple harmonic oscillations with the same frequency except at the nodes
- Amplitude of vibration varies from zero at the nodes, where the particle is permanently at zero displacement, to maximum at the antinodes
- The wave is divided into a number of segments of loops by the pattern of nodes and antinodes
- All particles in the same segment/ loop are vibrating in phase, but particles in adjacent segments or loops are $180\degree$ out of phase with one another
- The distance from a node to a node or a antinode to an antinode is half a wavelength ($\frac{1}{2}\lambda$)
- The distance from a consecutive node to an antinode is one quarter of a wavelength ($\frac{1}{4}\lambda$)
- There is no transmission of energy along the progression of waves, all the energy is contained within the stationary waves
- When the wave is at its maximum position, all of its energy is in potential energy
- When the wave appears to have no wave motion (looks like a flat line), all of its energy is in kinetic energy
### Comparing progressive waves and stationary waves
|Property|Progressive waves|Stationary waves|
|-|-|-|
|Amplitude|Amplitude is the same for all the particles in the path of the wave|Amplitude varies according to positions, from zero to the nodes to a maximum at the antinodes|
|Frequency|All particles oscillate at the same frequency|All particles oscillate at the same frequency except at the nodes|
|Wavelength|Wavelength is the distance between any 2 consecutive points on the waves that are in phase|Wavelength is 2 times the distance between a pair of adjacent nodes or antinodes|
|Phase|All particles within one wavelength have different phases|All particles within the same segment are in phase, particles in alternate segments are out of phase by $180 \degree$|
|Waveform|Propagates with the speed of the wave|No propagation of the wave profile|
|Energy|Energy is transmitted in the direction of travel of the wave|No transmission of energy, all energy is trapped in the vibratory motion of the stationary wave|
