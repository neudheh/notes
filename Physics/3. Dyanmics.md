## Newton's first law
- ==Newton's 1st law states than an object at rest tends to stay at rest, and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force==
### Inertia
- ==Inertia is the tendency of an object to continue in its original motion==
- Newton's first law of motion is also known as the law of inertia
- Inertia is dependent on the mass of the object
- The greater the mass of a body, the less it accelerates under the action of a given applied force
- Mass is a measure of inertia
## Linear momentum
- ==Linear momentum of an object is the product of the mass and the velocity of the object ==$$p =mv$$
- Where $p$: Linear momentum ($Kg\ m\ s^{-1}$ ), $m$: Mass ($Kg$), $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
- It is a vector
- SI Unit of $Kg\ m\ s^{-1}$ or $N s$
- When we have a large object moving with high velocity, it has a large momentum
- A small object moving slowly has a small momentum
- But, a small object moving with high velocity may have a large momentum
## Newton's second law
- ==Newton's 2nd law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the net force acting on the object, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force== $$F \propto \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
- If we are using SI units, $$F = \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$$$F = m \frac{dv}{dt} + v \frac{dm}{dt}$$
- For an object for fixed mass $m$, $$F = ma$$
- Where $F$: Force ($N$), $m$: Mass($Kg$), $a$: Acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
### Impulse
- Usually, the force exerted on an object is a variable force, acting over a period of time
- The integral of the force over the time interval, $\int F dt$, is known as the impulse of the force
- The impulse-momentum theorem states that the impulse of the force acting on the object is equal to the change in momentum of the object
$$Change\ in\ momentum\ \Delta p = Impulse\ I = Area\ under\ f-t\ graph$$
## Newton's third law
- ==Newton's 3rd law states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an equal and opposite force on body A==
- This reaction force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted on it
- The forces act on two different objects, hence they don't cancel each other
### Weightlessness
- While the actual weight of a person is determined by their mass and the acceleration of gravity, one's perceived weight comes from the fact that he is supported by floor, chair, etc
- One's feeling of weight comes from the fact that there is a normal force from their weight acting on them
- Weightlessness refers to a state of being in free fall in which there is no perceived support (i.e. no reaction force on the person by any support)
- Felt when a lift cable breaks, going over the top of a roller coaster, being in orbit, or putting an aircraft "over the hump" in ballistic trajectory
## Principle of conservation
- ==The principle of conservation of momentum states that total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the system after the collision, provided no net external force acts on the system==
- Consider mass A travelling with velocity $u_A$ colliding with mass B with velocity $u_B$
- During the collision, the two masses are in contact and exert a force $F$ on each other, with a time of impact $t$
- By newton's second law, for A $$F_A = m_a \frac{(v_a - u_a)}{t}$$
- For B $$F_B = m_b\frac{(v_b - u_b)}{t}$$
- By newton's third law, $$F_B = -F_A$$
- Rearranging $$m_au_a + m_bu_b = m_av_a + m_bv_b$$
$$Total\ momentum\ before\ collision = Total\ momentum\ after\ collision$$
- Where $m$: Mass ($kg$), $u$: Initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$),  $v$: final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
### Elastic collisions
- For an elastic collision, total momentum is conserved, and total energy is conserved
- For an inelastic collision, total momentum is conserved, but total energy is not conserved
- For an elastic collision, we can deduce that the $$Relative\ speed\ of\ approach = Relative\ speed\ of\ seperation$$
- Consider two spheres A and B colliding elastically with each other, with initial velocity $u_A and $u_B$ respectively, and final velocity $v_A$ and $v_B$ respectively
- Conservation of momentum $$m_Au_A + m_Bu_B = m_Av_A + m_Bv_B$$
- Conservation of kinetic energy $$\frac{1}{2}m_Au_A^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_Bu_B^2 = \frac{1}{2}m_Av_A^2 + \frac{1}{2}m_Bv_B^2$$
- Rewriting, $$m_A(u_A - v_A) = m_B(v_B - u_B)$$ $$m_A(u_A^2 - v_A^2) = m_B(v_B^2 - u_B^2)$$ $$m_A(u_A + v_A)(u_A - v_A) = m_B(v_B + u_B)(v_B - u_B)$$
- Taking equation 2/ 1 gives $$u_A + v_A = v_B + u_B$$$$u_A - u_B = v_B - v_A$$
- Where $m$: Mass ($kg$), $u$: Initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$),  $v$: final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)s
