## Allocative inefficiency
- When a market fails to allocate resources efficiently, it means that form society's point of view, the market equilibrium quantities is not allocative efficient (i.e. there is either an over/ under production/ consumption of some goods or services)
- In some instances, some goods and services may not even be produced
## Externalities
- ==An externality refers to a positive or negative impact on a third party not involved in the consumption or production of a good or service==
- A positive externality or external benefit refers to a beneficial impact on a third party not involved in the economic transaction
- A negative externality or external cost refers to an adverse impact on a third party not involved in the economic transaction
### Positive
- Vaccination has a positive externality in **consumption**
- Those who get the vaccine received private benefits to themselves in terms of higher resistance to such diseases while third parties like their family members and those around them enjoy some positive externality in the form of lesser risk contracting such diseases
- Research and development has a positive externality from **production**
- When one firm creates new ideas, products or processes, third parties can also benefit from this knowledge or technology by copying or adapting and building on the innovation, and earn higher profits
>[!NOTE] Answering technique
>P - Positive/ negative externality in consumption/ production
>D - Divergence of MSB and MPB curves
>S - Social equilibrium and private equilibrium
>A - Allocatiive inefficiency
>D - Deadweight loss

- The consumption of vaccines not only benefits individuals receiving the vaccination as it decreases their likelihood of being infected, but also the people around them as they will now be less likely to fall ill as well, even though they did not consume immunisation
- They enjoy the positive externality from the the consumption of immunisation, which is an external benefit to third parties not involved in the consumption of this good
![[positive externality.png]]
- The positive externality causes the marginal social benefit (MSB) to be greater than the marginal private benefit (MPB)
- This is because MSB includes the MPB and the marginal external benefits (MEB) of third parties
- Graphically, the existence of the MEB causes the MSB curve to be higher than the MPB curve, where the MEB is the vertical distance between the MSB and MPB curves
- Assuming there are no negative externalities, MPC = MSC
- Under the free market, consumers will base their consumption decisions on their MPB and disregard the external benefits
- Left to market forces the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$ where demand equal tot supply and the market equilibrium price will be at $P$
- However, the socially optima output and price is at $Q*$ and  $P*$, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximised
- The positive externalities generated from consumption of the good has resulted in underconsumption of immunisation  by $Q* - Q$ units, resulting to welfare loss (deadweight loss)
- For $Q* - Q$ units, the MSB is greater than the MSC, meaning that there is additional gain to society's welfare that can be reaped if more healthcare is consumed
- The total social benefit is equal to ares A + B while the total social cost is equal to area N, resulting in a deadweight loss of area B
- Therefore the free market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
### Negative
- Cigarettes have a negative externality in **consumption**
- When a person smokes a cigarette, their private costs include the price of cigarettes and the medical fees for any smoking-related diseases they contract
- The second-hand smoke produced is inhaled by tother people in the vicinity, causing health problems and hence potentially higher healthcare costs for these third parties
- Waste from industrial production has a negative externality in **production**
- The production of certain goods by industries has a private cost of the cost of the factor inputs
- However, third parties such as residents nearby incur healthcare costs by inhaling the polluted air and drinking the polluted water and falling ill
- The production of electricity by burning coal imposes a private cost to producers as they have to pay for factors of production like raw materials and wages
- The production of electricity causes air pollution, which causes health problems for third parties as they inhale the polluted air and have to incur medical expenses
- They suffer a negative externality form the firm's electricity generation, which is an external cost to third parties not involved in the production of the good
![[Negative externality.png]]
- The negative externality causes the marginal  social cost (MSC) to be greater than the marginal private cost (MPC)
- This is because the MSC includes the MPC and the marginal external cost (MEC) to third parties in society
- Graphically, the existence of the MEC causes the MSC curve to be higher than the MPC curve, where MEC is reflected in the vertical distance between the MSC and the MPC curves
- Assuming no positive externalities, MPB =MSB
- Under the free market, producers will base their production decisions on their MPC and disregard the external costs
- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$ where demand equals supply and the market equilibrium price will be at $P$
- However, the socially optimal output and price is at Q* and P*, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximised
- The positive externalities generated from consumption of the good has resulted in overproduction of electricity  by $Q - Q*$ units, resulting to welfare loss (deadweight loss)
- For $Q - Q*$ until, MSC is greater than MSB, meaning there is a loss to society's welfare from these additional units produced
- The total social costs is equal to area D + E while the total social benefit is equal to area D, resulting in a deadweight loss of area E
- Therefore the free market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
## Imperfect information
- Imperfect information occurs when potential buyers/ seller have incomplete/ inaccurate/ uncertain/limited info, causing them to possibly make 'wrong' choices, leading to market failure
- This can come in the form of consumer ignorance or asymmetric information
### Consumer ignorance (benefits)
- The consumption of healthcare has long-term benefits to one's health and wellbeing
- Preventive healthcare (e.g. health screenings) or early treatment of illnesses can help reduce the likelihood of further health complications in the future
- However, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these long-term gains and under estimate the true benefits that consuming healthcare provides
![[Imperfect info benefits.png]]
- The under-estimation of benefits by the consumer causes the perceived marginal private benefit (MPB) to be lower than the true MPB of consuming healthcare
- Consumers would base their consumption on their perceived MPB and hence the perceived MPB curve is also the market demadn curve
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the True MPB, while the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply, and the socially optimal price will be at $P$
- The socially optimal output is at $Q*$ and socially optimal price is at $P*$, where MSC = MSB and society's welfare is maximised
- Since the market equilibrium is at $Q$, there is underconsumption of healthcare of $Q*-Q$ units
- For $Q*-Q$  the MSB is greater than MSC, meaning that there is additional gain to society's welfare that can be reaped if more healthcare is consumed
- The total social benefits is equal to area M + N, while the total social costs is equal to area N, resulting in a deadweight loss of area M
- Therefore, the free market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
### Consumer ignorance (costs)
- Smoking causes long-term harm to one's own health and well-being, as it increases the likelihood of further health complications in the future such as lung cancer
- However, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these harms from smoking and over-estimate the true value that smoking provides
![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
- The overestimation of the value of smoking by the consumer causes the perceived marginal private benefit (MPB) to be higher than the true MPB of smoking
- Consumers would base their consumption decision on their perceived MPB, hence the perceived MPB curve is also the market demand curve
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the True MPB curve, while the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Left to market forces, market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply and the market equilibrium price will be at $P$
- The socially optimal output is at $Q*$ while the socially optimal price is at $P*$, where MSC = MSB, and societies welfare is maximised
- Since the market equilibrium at $Q$, there is an overconsumption of cigarettes of $Q - Q*$ units
- For $Q*$ to $Q$, the MSB is lower than the MSC, which means there is a loss to society's welfare from these additional units of cigarettes consumed
- The total social costs is equal to area A + B while the total social benefit is equal to area B, thus there is a deadweight loss of area A
- Therefore, the free market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
### Asymmetric information
- Asymmetric information occurs when one side of the market (either buyers or sellers) have better information than the other
- The information available to the buyer and seller differs, resulting in a distortion of incentives and inefficient market outcomes
#### Adverse selection (Buyers)
- ==Adverse selection is a situation in which asymmetric information between consumers and producers results in an unfavourable selection of products/ buyers participating in a market==
- This lead to a missing market for other buyers/ sellers who do not get to buy/ sell the good even though it is beneficial for them to do so
- It occurs before the transition has completed
- A 'lemon' is a poor quality product, such as a second hand car that needs frequent repairs
- There is asymmetric information in the second hand car market, as the seller knows more about the quality of the car they are selling than the buyers
- The price offered by the buyers in the second hand car market is based on whether they think they are being sold a high or low quality car
- A typical buyer is willing to pay a higher price if the knows that the used car is of high quality (a cherry)
- On the other hand, if he knows that the used car is of low-quality (a lemon), he will be willing to pay only a low price
- The price that sellers are willing to accept is based on the quality of the car with is known to them
- The seller of a high quality used car is prepared to part with it only if he is offered a high price
- For a low quality used car, he is prepared to accept a low price
- Consumers know that there are low-quality cars being offered for sale which particular car is of low or high quality
- They will assume that half the cars are of high quality and half are low quality, and they will be prepared to offer only an average price for a car
- Sellers of high quality cars are not prepared to accept this average price, and will not offer their cars for sale and leave the market
- On the other hand, sellers of low quality cars are willing to sell their cars at the average price and will join the market
- As the quality of cars on offer slowly deteriorates, the average price that consumers are willing to offer will fall
- More and more sellers of high quality cars will leave the market, and the market will be increasingly dominated by lemons
- This phenomenons is known as an adverse selection problem
- In the extreme case, all cars sold and purchased in the used-car market are lemons
- The market for cherries disappears, resulting in a missing market
- Consumers who desire to buy the 'cherry' and producers who desire to sell the 'cherry' will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of good quality cars, where willing buyers and sellers are matched in the market
- However, since the better quality producers are driven out of the market by low quality products due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit to society from having some good quality products traded is lost 
- Society's welfare is not maximised, resulting in allocative inefficiency
#### Adverse selection (Firms)
- There is asymmetric information in the insurance market, as a person who buys a health insurance policy know much more about his/her risks and needs for insurance than the insurance firm
- There are high costs customers with high-medical expenses (fall ill frequently) and low-cost customers with low medical expenses (fall ill rarely)
- The insurance company is unable to distinguish between high sot and low cost customers but it must charge a price for insurance
- If the insurance company assumes that half its customers are high cost and half low cost, it will offer coverage at a price that is equal to the average cost of providing insurance coverage 
- However, this price would be higher than what low-cost costumers are willing to pay, and they will drop out of the insurance market
- On the other hand, this price is lower than what high-cost costumers are prepared to pay, and more high-cost customers join the market
- With increasingly more high-cost customers buying insurance, the average cost of insurance companies rises and the average price that insurance companies charge consequently rises
- More low-cost customers drop out of the market, and the market will increasingly be dominated by high cost customers
- In the extreme case, only high-cost customers are left in the insurance market
- The market for insurance for low-cost customers disappears, resulting in a missing market
- Low-cost customers who desire to buy the good and producers who desire to sell the good to low-cost customers will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of insurance to low-cost customers, where willing buyers and sellers are matched int he market
- However, since low costs customers are driven out of the market due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit to society from having some low-cost customers insured is lost
- Society welfare is not maximised, resulting in allocative inefficiency
#### Moral hazard
- ==Moral hazard is the situation in which economic agents take greater risks/ act less carefully than they normally would because the resulting costs will not be borne by them==
- Moral hazards happened after the transaction has been completed, when the party that is insured can affect the probability/ magnitude of the event that triggers payment
- Moral hazard can arise when a party to a contract changes their behaviour as a consequence of the contract
- The most common examples of moral hazard can be found in the insurance markets
- Insurance may cause people tot take greater risks because they know the costs of undesirable outcomes of taking risks will be borne by insurance companies
- If a person buys home insurance buys home insurance for theft, they may become very casual about locking the doors of his/her house, changing the risk the insurance company thought they were taking on based on this person's history of no burglary
- When the insured party takes action not observed by the insurer, i.e. no information) that increases the probability of the event that triggers payment from the insurer, it will drive up the insurer's cost to the point that the business is no longer profitable
- The service will no longer be provided as there is insufficient incentive (profits) to offer it on sale, and there will be a missing market for the service
- Moral hazard can also arise in a principal-agent problem, where one person (agent) is performing some tasks on behalf of another person (principal)
- If the actions of the agent cannot be perfectly monitored, the agent would then undertake more risk or put in less effort than what is desired by the principal
- Moral hazard might cause mutually advantageous trade to not take place, and there is no market for it due to a lack of trust between buyers and sellers
- There is market failure as the potential net benefit to society from having these goods and service traded is lost, and society's welfare is not maximised
#### Supplier-induced demand
- ==If a producer has more information than the consumer, a situation of supplier-induced demand may arise where consumer end up buying more goods/ services than what is optimal for them==
- A doctor (seller) may know more about the health of a patient and the relevance of treatment or health checks than the patient (buyer) does
- Lacking expertise, the patients are likely to listen to the doctors for advice when deciding how much healthcare services to consume
- Profit-motivated doctors may lead certain patients to believe that certain non-essential healthcare services or tests are required
- This causes the consumers' perceived MPB to be higher than the true MPB
- Consumers would base their consumption decision on their perceived MPB, hence the perceived MPB curve is also the market demand curve
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the True MPB curve, while the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Left to market forces, market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply and the market equilibrium price will be at $P$
- The socially optimal output is at $Q*$ while the socially optimal price is at $P*$, where MSC = MSB, and societies welfare is maximised
- Since the market equilibrium at $Q$, there is an overconsumption of cigarettes of $Q - Q*$ units
- For $Q*$ to $Q$, the MSB is lower than the MSC, which means there is a loss to society's welfare from these additional units of cigarettes consumed
- The total social costs is equal to area A + B while the total social benefit is equal to area B, thus there is a deadweight loss of area A
- Therefore, the free market has failed to achieve allocative efficiency as society's welfare is not maximised

## Factor immobility
- ==Factor immobility refers to the inability or/and unwillingness of factors of production to move between uses or locations==
- There are two types: Occupational and geographical
### Occupational immobility
- Occupational immobility refers to the inability or/and unwillingness of factors of production to move between occupations or industries
- Caused by
1. Lack of skills and knowledge acquired from training and education - e.g. becoming a doctor requires lengthy training to pick up required specialised knowledge and skills
2. Lack of natural talent - e.g. not every can become a chef because the job requires a sharp palette, among other natural qualities
3. Barriers imposed by professional associations and trade unions - unions or professional associations can make it difficult for outsiders to enter a particular industry by recognising qualifications from certain universities only or needing the person to be a member first to obtain employment
### Geographical immobility
- Geographical immobility refers to the inability or/and unwillingness of factors of production to move between geographical areas
- Cause by
1. Family and other social ties - a person may not be willing to relocate and take on a job in another city because he does not want to be separated from relatives and friends 
2. Costs of moving can be high - costs of selling and buying a house, removal expenses and other associated expenditure
3. Differences in cost of living regions - e.g. cost of living is higher in cities than rural areas, making workers unwilling and/ or unable top move and work in cities
### How it causes market failure
- Factor immobility results in unemployment and hence wastage of resources
- The economy will be producing on a point inside the PPC, hence it is productively inefficient, which is a prerequisite for allocative efficiency
>[!NOTE] Example
> - With a growing number of elderly residents and low birth rates resulting in fewer children, there will be a falling demand for primary education and increasing demand for healthcare
> - This raises the price and hence profitability of producing healthcare services
> - Healthcare providers will wish to increase the quantity supplied
> - They will as a result increase their demadn for the services of nurses/ social workers
> - The falling demand for primary education will decrease the derived demand for primary school teachers and these teachers may be retrenched
> - These unemployed people with job-specific skills probably do not have the relevant skills to take up jobs available in the healthcare industry and will remain unemployed
> - The healthcare industry is also not able to get the desired amount of labour needed to increase quantity supplied to meet the rise in demand
> - Thus, they cannot produce at the socially optimal level of healthcare, resulting in welfare loss
## Public goods
- ==A public good is a good that is non-excludable, non-rivalrous and non-rejectable==
- Non-excludability means that it is impossible or very costly to prevent someone who has not paid from consuming the good
- Non-rivalry means that consumption of the good by one person does not diminish the availability of the good for another person
- This implies that consumption of the good by more people does no incur any additional cost (i.e. MCOP for providing for an additional user is zero)
- Non-rejectability means that there is an inability of consumers to refuse the consumption of a good once it has been produced
- For example, national defence is a public good
- It is non-excludable as everyone in a country will enjoy the defence regardless of whether they paid for it - it is impossible to selectively defend only certain people in a country
- National defence is also non-rivalrous because when one person consumers national defence, it does not reduce the level of defence available for others in the country
- National defence is non-rejectable, because when deterrence to external threats is created by the provision of national defence, a person in the country will not be able to refuse the safety created even if he wants to
### How it causes market failure
- Since public goods by nature are non-excludable, it is impossible or impractical for producers to exclude those who have not paid from consuming the good
- This means that consumers can be free riders that benefit from a good or service without paying for it, therefore no consumer would be willing to pay for public goods
- As there is no effective demand since consumers are not willing to pay, producers will be unable to sell their good at any positive price level and will not earn revenue to cover the cost of production
- At zero price, no profit motivated private producer would be willing and able to supply the good
- When left to the free market, there will be no production of public goods and total market failure occurs
- The potential net benefit to society form having some level of public goods produced and consumed is lost, resulting in allocative inefficiency
