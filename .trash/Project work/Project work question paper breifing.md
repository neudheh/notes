# Task 1: Oppoturnity
- Oppoturnity means a time or set of circumstances that makes it possible to do something
- Synonmys: occasion, chance, opening
- Oppturnities for improving what is already existing, the possiblity of starting something based on exisitng trends
- Oppoturnites available: https://simplicaple.com/new/oppoturnity
## Task requirments
- Identify an area
	- Choose a highly specific area of busniness. school/ enviroment/ entertainment/ envrtioment. healthcare/ agricultiure/ the arts/ remote acess of control/ RFID/ online platforms ETC
	- Onward singapore (SWOT analysis (Strengths, weakness oppotunrity and threats))
	- Pestel analysis
- Where lies the oppoturnity 
	- Identify/ name the oppoturnity and provide evidence of the signigicance of oppoturnity oin the specific area highligted
	- e.g. capitalising on the oppoturnity to devolp an area of the arts or education further
	- Increasing prevalence of certian trends
- Impact -Examine postive and negative consqeuences of oppoturnity taken
- Positive and negative impact of oppoturnity on target greoup
	- e.g. Under a New Woof example -Sees an oppoturnity in encouraging the adoption of dogs in shelters by designing an app to match potential dog owners to suitable pets via the bark buddy app
	- Enchance postive; minimize negative
		- Enchance positive aspects
		- Minimize the negative aspects
		- Increase the scopes breath, depth and intensity
	- Solutions designed need to form a clear link to how they 'enhance positive outcomes' or minimize negaitve impacts'
	- Frameowrk of solutions should outline how all 3 solutions enhance positve impacts and minimize negative impacts
## Checkpoints
- Analysise importance of oppotunrity and what has been done
- analyse outcomes +ve and -ve
- How to amplify outcomes +ve and -ve
# Task 2: Digitalization
- Digitalization - Adaptaion of a system, process, etc, to be operated with the use of computers and the internet
- **DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIGITIZATION AND DIGITALIZAITION**
	- Digitization describes the pure analog-to-digital conversoon of existing data and documents
	- Too narrow to focus on digitization; focus on the affordances of digitisation towards other goals
- Target group has to have already adopted digitization in some form
- What has beedn done 
	- Provide evidence of digitalization and analyse the resons for the significane of digitalisation in the specific area highlighted
	- R&A has to be important, with other to prove that this problem is significant, ideas are nothing without them
- Impact
	- +ve and -ve consqerunces of actions. measure taken to adopt digital solutions
- Positive and negative impact of digitalization on target greoup
	- e.g. Under a New Woof example -Sees an oppoturnity in encouraging the adoption of dogs in shelters by designing an app to match potential dog owners to suitable pets via the bark buddy app
	- Enchance postive; minimize negative
		- Enchance positive aspects
		- Minimize the negative aspects
		- Increase the scopes breath, depth and intensity
	- Solutions designed need to form a clear link to how they 'enhance positive outcomes' or minimize negaitve impacts'
	- Frameowrk of solutions should outline how all 3 solutions enhance positve impacts and minimize negative impacts
## Checkpoints
- Analysise importance of oppotunrity and what has been done
- analyse outcomes +ve and -ve
- How to amplify outcomes +ve and -ve
# 3PS
- Product
- Process -e.g. keeping tracjk of the processes housholds or restraunts go through to track for food wastage
- Publicity - Creatively publicising impactful messages to your target group and the soultuons came up with (anything can be publicity, see, feel, touch, wear, guerilla marketing) BE CREATIVE!!!!
	- Ground you walk on ,tables, chairs, what you wear, mediyms that empoy
- Not necessary to have process, 1 product, 1 publicity, can have 2 products as processes are not applicable to all
# Additional notes
- Find an area with a signigicant problem faced by a target group
- For both tasks, make sure to analse the singiicane of the measures/ actions taken
- Both tasks need +e and -ve outcomes
- Ensure research findings upport the outcomes mentions (reliablity of source can be questioned during OP)
- Choice of topics this year need to ensure there is room for adressing the +ve and -ve outcomes
- Exisiting areas of oppoturnity and digitalisation that you find are not just case studies, the target goeup you identify will be need to followed through all the way in terms of bettering the +ve outcomes and reducing -ve ones based on exisitng measures for the same target group
- BE specific with your scoping, not jsut ealderly or youth, byt s ascoped and precise group with literature revies or evidence to support justificaiton
- NO generic applications like just using e-payments, as it used in many area and is generic
- Dont incoperate 4 national languages, is very gfeneric and can be applied to almost any project topic and it is stoo sweeping in nature, will not score for analysis creativity and insightfulness
- FInd topics that offer concrete desigining of solutions
# Timeline
- T2W1 Schooools should have ther annex B formulating a STARS problenm statementa dn generic solution
- ST feedback to reine and submit a draft by T2W2
