## Quadratic function that can be factorized
### Method 1: Graphical method
1. Factorize the polynomial
   $$ 2x^2 + x -15 > 0$$
   $$(x+3)(2x-5)>0$$
2. Draw the graph
	- If the coefficient of $x^2$ is positive, the graph is a smiley face; else if it is negative it is a frowny face
	- Find the value of x when $(x+3)=0$ and when $(2x+5) = 0$
	- The graph will cut the x-axis at these values of x.![[factorizable_quadratic_graphical_method.png]]
3. Solve
	- In this case, they are looking for values where X is > 0, or when x is positive
	- So, $x<-3$ or $x>2.5$
