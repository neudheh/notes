## Equity
- ==Equity refers to the fairness in distribution of output among individuals==
- In a free market economy, an individual's ability to consume goods and services and the allocation of resources depends on their dollar vote, which depends on their income and other resources such as savings
- An excessively unequal distribution of income may result in an unfair allocation of resources, as the free market tends to allocate resources to produce goods and services for those who are willing and have the ability to pay
- People with high income levels can determine what should be produced this way as they are able to cast higher dollar votes for the goods and services they want
- Profit-maximising produces will channel or divert more scarce resources into the production of luxury goods for the rich, while diverting these resources away from the production of other goods that could easily satisfy the needs of the poor, who are less likely to have the ability to pay
- This distribution of resources can be considered unfair because it results in an excessive amount of scarce resources to the production of goods and services demanded by the rich, and an inadequate amount of resources to the production of goods and services that the poor may require
>[!NOTE]
>- There is a difference between equality and equity
>- Equality is achieved when everyone an equal portion of income/ output
>- Equity is about whether the output/ income is split fairly
>- E.g. Should the poor receive more
>- Different societies will have different views on what is fair
>- Fairness is thus a normative idea
- Economists are less concerned about equality, they are concerned with how inequality in the distribution of income may give rise to inequitable distribution of goods and services
- Inequity, or unfairness in the distribution of goods and services can eb attributed too
	- ==The price of essential good and services being too high, and thus unaffordable for the poor==
	- ==The distribution of income being too unequal, with the poor not being able to afford essential goods and services==
## Income inequality
- ==Income inequality refers to the extent in which income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population==
### Gini coefficient
- ==The Gini coefficient measures the degree of inequality in income distribution across a population==
- It takes on a value between 0 - 1, where 0 represents perfect income equality
- The greater the Gini coefficient and the closer it is to 1, the greater the income inequality within the nation
>[!NOTE] Calculating the Gini coefficient
>- The gini coefficient is calculated with the help of a Lorenz curve, a graph showing the cumulative proportion of households
>- It is ranked according to household income on the horizontal axis, and the vertical axis showing the cumulative proportion of household income
>$$Gini\ coefficient = \frac{Area A}{Area (A+B)}$$
>![[gini coffecient.jpg]]
>- The further the Lorenz curve is from the $45 \degree$ total equality line, the larger the Gini coefficient, and the more uneven the income distribution

- We can look at how one country's Gini coefficient compares with other countries
	- If the Gini coefficient for one country is relatively higher than most countries, it implies relatively high income inequality and vice-versa
- We can also look at how the Gini coefficient changes over time
	- If the Gini coefficient for a country is increasing over time, it implies widening income inequality in a country and vice-versa
### Causes of income inequality
#### Unequal factor endowments
- In a free market economy, where private property is allowed, households that own land, capital and shares in companies in addition to labour, will earn more income than households that only own labour
- Labour comes from individuals in the households
- Besides wages, these richer households will be earning rent, interest and profit

- The rich also tend to provide their future with better education, so that they can get higher wages in the future
- Furthermore, they leave their children with large inheritance, jump-starting the process of wealth accumulation
- Greater **wealth** inequality means a larger difference between individuals starting points (e.g. in terms of possessing more or less factors of production), leading to greater **income** inequality
#### Difference in prices for the same factor of production
- Income inequality can also arise between the same types of factor of production (e.g. labour)
- There are different types of labour - skilled and unskilled labour
- A highly skilled individual working as a professional is likely to earn more than unskilled individual working in a more menial occupation
- One of they key contributing factors of income inequalities is that of wage differentials between different occupations
## Wage differentials
- In the labour market, the equilibrium wage rate is determined by the demand and supply of labour
- Below is a wage differential diagram
![[wage differnetial diagram.png]]
- The demand for labour now comes form firms as the need workers to produce good and services to generate revenue
- Household on the other hand are the suppliers of labour
## Market demand for labour
- A market labour demand curve shows the number of workers firms are willing and able to hire at different wage rates, ceteris paribus
### Movement along the labour demand curves
- An increase in wage rate will lead to a fall in quantity of labour demanded
- Profit-maximising forms will employ units of labour up to the point where marginal benefit is equal to the marginal cost of doing so
- The MB is the additional revenue each unit of labour produces for the firm
- The MC is the wage rate
- When the wage rate rises, the MC now exceeds the MB of hiring an additional unit of labour
- A profit maximising firm will lower its employment of labour, and produce less output, or substitute capital (machinery) for labour, (i.e. turn to a more capital-intensive method of production which has now become relatively cheaper)
### Shifting of the labour demand curve
#### Change in price of output due to a change in demand for the good
- Labour is a derived demand, thus the demand for a particular good or services would affect the demand for labour
- A rise in demand for healthcare due to an ageing population would result in an increase in its price
- This increase in price of healthcare means that the additional revenue each healthcare worker contributes to the firm is now much higher, raising the demand for healthcare worker
#### Change in labour productivity
- An increase in the productivity of labour means a rise in output per worker, increasing the worker's revenue contribution to a firm
- Cleans would be more productive if they had better training, more equipment or improved technology
- The same number of cleaners can now clean a larger area, generating more revenue for the company
- Thus, at the same wage rate, firms would find it attractive to hire more cleaners, increasing the market demand for cleaners
#### Change in productivity of capital
- Advancements in technology have improved the productivity of capital
- This has led to firms replacing workers with machines (capital-labour substitution), in a bid to reduce their cost of production
- This would reduce firms need for labour, lowing labour demand
## Market supply of labour
- A market labour supply curve shows the number of person hours that workers are willing and able to offer at different wage rates, ceteris paribus
### Movement along the labour supply curve
 - An increase in wage rate will lead to a rise in quantity of labour supplied
 - Workers are usually faced with a choice between having more income or leisure time when deciding how many labour hours to offer
 - Hence, leisure time incurs an opportunity cost (i.e. income foregone)
 - An increase in the wage rate increases the opportunity cost of leisure, causing them to reduce leisure hours and increase the quantity of labour supplied
### Shifts along the labour supply curve
#### Change in how many people can get qualified
-  A change in the number of appropriately skilled workers for a specific industry will change the labour supply in the market
- Can be determined by government policies (e.g. licensing requirements for lawyers, doctors, pharmacists, and accountants)
- The supply of nurses would increase over time with higher government spending on education and training for nurses
- Additionally, labour supply may be lower and more price inelastic for professions that involve some degree of difficulty in securing the requisite qualifications
- E.g. A specialist doctor may require ten or more years of post-graduate education and training
- Relatively few people have the ability and desire to undergo such lengthy and intensive training
- As such, the supply of labour for medical specialists is relatively low and price inelastic
#### Changes in population demographics
- Population demographics affects the size of the working population
- An ageing population means that labour supply is likely to fall over time, as the number of people in the population that enter retirement exceeds the number of new entrants in the workforce
#### Change in foreign labour policy
- The influx of foreign workers (usually low-skilled) results in a high supply of workers in low skilled industries, thus wage rates of such occupations tend to be low
- The gradual tightening of inflow of foreign labour leads to a fall in labour supply 
#### Change in attractiveness of job role
- The attractiveness of a job is depended on characteristics such as working conditions, and the relative attractiveness in relation to other jobs, in monetary and non-monetary terms
- Some people are attracted to join the healthcare sector as nurses or nursing assistants because of the opportunity to care for others
- But the long working hours discourage many from joining
## Wage differentials between occupations
- Wage differentials occur between occupations because there are differences in the levels of demand and supply for these occupations
### Demand
- Certain occupations generate more revenue than others for any given level of employment
- A senior lawyer can help a law firm earn a huge amount of revenue through their legal services
- A waiter creates considerably lesser revenue for a restaurants
- This results in the market demand for waiters being lower than the market demand for lawyers
### Supply
- Wage differentials also exits in supply factors
- An occupation with a lower labour supply will give rise to a higher wage rate
### Why do wage differentials between jobs or industries persist over time
- One reason is because of factor immobility, which could be due to occupational or geographical immobility
- Occupational immobility is a situation where resources are not able to move freely form one occupation or sector to another
- People often find it difficult to switch rapidly from one job to another
- Different jobs tend to require specific and different skills, so workers would need to undergo retraining to be able to switch to another job
- Geographical immobility is a situation where resources are not able to move freely form one location to another
- In the case of labour, people are often relocate for work, resulting in a limited supply of certain professions in a particular country or region, causing wages of that job to remain high
