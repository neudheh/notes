## Allocative efficiency
- ==Allocative efficiency is a situation in which the combination of the goods and services provided maximizes the total economic welfare of society==
- Occurs when goods and services that are wanted by society are produced in the right quantities, from society's point of view
$$Marginal\ social\ benefits\ (MSB) = Marginal\ social\ cost\ (MSC)$$
- The additional benefit to society of the last unit of output is equal to the marginal social cost to society of the last unit of output
## Price mechanism
- A free market is a market free from government intervention
- The market is left on its own and households and firms are free to pursue self-interest
- Households seek to maximize satisfaction, and they own all resources
- Firms seek to maximize profits, and they undertake production
- In the free market, households make consumption decisions independent from firms, and firms make production decisions independent from households
- There is no one person or authority that is planning and directing the economy
- Yet, the economy moves towards producing certain goods and services in certain quantities due to the price mechanism
- The price mechanism refers to the interaction between market demand (reflecting consumers' decisions) and market supply (reflecting firms' decisions)
- This determines the price to be charged and the output to be produced for different goods and services
- This helps to to determine the allocation of scarce resources between competing uses
- It helps to determine what the produce, who to produce for, and how to produce
### Signaling role of prices
- The signaling role of prices help the economy to decide what and how much to produce of one good or service
- If all markets were perfectly competitive, there will be consumer sovereignty in a free market economy
- This means that consumers will ultimately determine which goods and services are produced by firms
- Consumers 'vote' for what they want firms to produce though their purchases, and 'vote' against a product by not buying it
- Thus, consumers determine what and how much to produce through dollar votes
- The rise in price also signals to consumers that the net marginal benefit of a good is now lower and disincentivizes them to buy the same quantity
- This is reflected as a movement along a DD curve
### Incentive role of prices
- Firms then produce these goods at prices they are willing to accept
- As resources are scarce and command a price, firms will devote scarce resources to produce a particular good or service only if its production is profitable
- How much of a good is produced in the market is determine the price at which quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied
- Changes in price signal to producers if more or less resources should be dedicated to the production of a good

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- When consumers increase their demand for a particular good (cars) due to changes in a non-price factor (rise in income)
>- The rise in demand is indicated by their willingness and ability to pay a higher price for it
>- The rise in demand is represented by a shift in the demand curve to $DD'$, leading to a shortage of $Q_2 - Q_e$ units at the initial price, putting upward pressure on prices
>- The rise in price incentivises firms to increase quantity supplied (movement along SS curve) because it means a higher profit margin
>- It also allows them to cover the increasing marginal cost of production
>- The higher price means that firms are getting more than waht they need to cover their marignal cost of production

- The rise in profitability due to the rise in price incentivizes profit-motivated firms to increase production in response to the changes in preference of consumers
- The firms will enter the market for factors of production and demand for more 
### Rationing role of prices
- Prices help the determine who to produce for
- Profit-motivated firms will only produce for those who are willing and able to pay the price that at least covers the marginal cost of production incurred
- Thus, the market equilibrium price determines who receives the good as it is only given those who are willing and able to pay the market equilibrium price
## How the price mechanism achieves allocative efficiency
### Consumers
- The demand curve represents the maximum price consumers are willing and able to pay for various quantities of the good
- A rationale consumer would want to maximize their net total private benefit
- They will only buy an additional unit of a good as long as the marginal private benefit (MPB) is greater than the marginal private cost (MPC)
- The MPB is the additional utility from consuming an additional unit of the good
- The MPC is the additional cost from consuming an additional unit of the good, which is the price of the good
- The maximum price they are willing to pay is therefore equal to the marginal benefit they gain from consuming one more unit of the good
- Thus, the market demand curve is equal to the MPB curve
### Producers
- The supply curve represents the minimum price producers are willing and able to accept for various quantities of a good sold
- A rational producers would want to maximize profits
- He would be willing to sell an additional unit of a good as long as its marginal private benefit (MPB) of producing it exceeds its marginal private cost (MPC)
- The MPB is the additional revenue gained from selling one more unit of the good, which is equal to the price of the good
- The MPC is the cost of production of the good
- The minimum price they are willing to sell the good at is therefore equal to the marginal cost of producing one more unit of the good
- Thus, the market supply curve is equal to the MPC curve
---
- ==Assuming no externalities==, the MPC incurred by firms is the same as the marginal social cost (MSC) incurred by all of society
- The MPB enjoyed by consumers is equal to the marginal social benefit (MSB) enjoyed by all of society
- As such in a ==perfectly competitive market== for a ==private good==, the demand curve reflects the MPB and MSB, and the supply curve reflects the MPC and MSC
![[allocative efficiency in the free market.png]]
- As such, the market equilibrium point $e$ is also the socially optimal equilibrium, where MSB = MSC
- At $Q_e$, society's welfare is maximized, and allocative efficiency is achieved
### Consider what if market output is less than/ more than
- If market output is less than $Q_e$, for units $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, the MSB is greater than the MSC
	- For every additional unit of output from $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, the additional satisfaction to society is greater than the additional cost incurred
	- Total social benefit is given by area $beQ_eQ_1$, and total social cost is given by area $ceQ_eQ_1$
	- There could be a net increase in society's welfare of area $bec$ if society was to produce $Q_1$ to $Q_e$ units
	- Thus, society's welfare is not maximized and allocative efficiency is not achieved
- If the market output is more than $Q_e$, for units $Q_e$ to $Q_2$, the MSC is greater than the MSB
	- For every additional unit of output from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$, the additional cost incurred by society is greater than the additional satisfaction
	- Total social benefit is given by area $eyQ_2Q_e$, and total social cost is given by area $exQ_2Q_e$
	- There is a net loss in society's welfare of area  $exy$ that is incurred becuase society produced and consumed $Q_e$ to $Q_2$ units
	- Thus, society's welfare is not maximized and allocative efficiency is not achieved
### Allocative efficiency using CS/PS
- At the market equilibrium output $Q_e$ where the demand and supply curves intersect, the sum of consumer and producer surplus is maximized, hence society's welfare is maximized and allocative efficiency is achieved
