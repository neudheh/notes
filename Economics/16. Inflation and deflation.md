## Inflation and deflation
- ==Inflation is a situation where there is a sustained increase (3-4 years) in the general price level of an economy==
- The general price level is the average price of all goods and services in the economy during a period of time
- Inflation is economy wide, and is not the increase in pries of certain items only due to a temporary increase in demand
- Inflation is a continued increase in the GPL, not a one-time increase
- The inflation rate is the rate of change of the general price level
- The consumer price index measures the changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by the average household over time
### Other terms
- **Stagflation**: High unemployment and rapid inflation, with negligible or even negative economic growth
- **Deflation**: Sustained decrease in the 
- **Disinflation**: Inflation rate is still positive, but declining over time
## Real value of money
- The real value of money is the purchasing power, or the quantity of goods and services it can buy
- When there is inflation, the GPL rises and the real value of money falls
- This is because the same amount of money can now buy fewer units of goods and services
- Internal value of money is the domestic purchasing power, how many units of goods/ services one unit of local currency can buy
- External value of money is the foreign exchange rate, how many units of foreign currency one unit of local currency can buy in the forex market
## Causes of inflation
### Demand-pull inflation
- Result of increasing AD
- Happens when the economy is near or at full employment
- Associated with a booming economy, when the economy is producing near full employment levels of output, and there is a lack of spare capacity

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand pull inflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL of $P_{1}$ and national output of $Y_{1}$
> - When AD rises form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$, profit motivated firms respond by increasing production
> - When firms increase output and operate closer to the full employment level of output, production becomes less efficient
> - They will use to resources that are less and less suitable for production
> - Thus, more labour and other inputs are needed per additional unit of output produced, causing the unit cost of production to rise
> - Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices
> - Hence, a rise in AD causes a rise in national output, but also leads to a rise in the GPL
> - If AD rises further, with the increased scarcity of resources, the GPL rises further with lesser increase in national output
> - Once $Y_f$ is reached, further rises in AD would only lead to a rise in GPL

- AD can rise due to Non-Monetary factors ([[Economics/13. AD-AS Model]])
	- (Increased consumer spending (**C**), increased investment spending (**I**), Increased government spending (**G**), increased export revenue (**X-M**))
- AD can also rise due to monetary factors
	- When the money supply rises and exceeds money demand, the public will convert the excess money into physical assets by spending it on goods and services
	- This causes consumption to rise, boosting AD
	- But, if the economy is near of at full employment, the GPL would rise, as there is too much money chasing after fewer goods and services in an economy
### Cost-push inflation
- Results of increasing unit cost of production (SRAS)

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[cost push inflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL of $P_{1}$ and national output of $Y_{1}$
>- When there is a rise in the unit cost of production, firms will only be willing to continue producing the same level of output only if they receive higher prices
>- Thus, AS falls from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
>- Equilibrium GPL rises to $P_2$ as firms pass the higher unit costs of production onto consumer as higher prices. while equilibrium national output drops to $Y_2$
>- If the cost push pressure continues, then AS continues to fall, causing the horizontal AS section continues to shift up, and GPL continues to rise

- A fall in AS causes stagflation, where prices rise and real national output falls
### Causes of cost-push inflation
#### Wage-push
- Countries with shrinking labour forces may suffer wage-push inflation
	- The labour force may decline due to ageing population or govt policies on immigration and foreign labour
	- This would cause labour shortages, driving up wage rates
- Trade unions can also push up wage rates independently of the demand for labour
	- Trade unions force firms to pay higher wages or else they would strike
	- When wage rate rise faster than the rise in labour productivity, inflation may set in due to the rising unit costs of production
	- When trade unions can push wage rate by a larger extent more than improvements in labour productivity, there would be repeated supply shocks and rises in the GPL
#### Imported inflation
- An increase in the price of imported inputs which are key inputs for many products would cause a rise in the unit cost of production
- This would cause the GPL to rise as firms pass on the higher unit cost of production onto consumers, as they would not be willing to produce if their marginal revenue is lesser than the unit cost of production
#### Depreciation of foreign exchange rate
- Deprecation of the local currency would result in the price of imported inputs in terms of local currency, causing unit costs of production to rise
- This would cause the GPL to rise as firms pass on the higher unit cost of production onto consumers, as they would not be willing to produce if their marginal revenue is lesser than the unit cost of production
#### Tax-push
- A rise in indirect taxes like GST would increase the unit cost of production
- Firms will pass on these taxes to consumers by raising prices, increasing GPL
- The rising cost of living would cause workers to ask for higher wages to maintain their current purchasing power
- Thus there is further increase in the UCOP, resulting GPL to rise more than once (wage-price spiral)

### Interaction of demand-pull and cost-push inflation

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Rise in AD/ Fall in AS
>![[both demand pull and cost push inflation.png]]
>- A rise in AD (due to a rise in export revenue) would cause trade unions bargaining for higher wages as they do not want workers' purchasing power to fall
>- This causes the UCOP to rise, resulting in cost-push inflation
>- There will also be shortages in the labour market as a result of rising AD, strengthening trade union's bargaining power and they may demand further increases in wage rates
>**How it causes inflation**
>- Economy is initially in equilibrium with GPL of $P_1$ and output $Y_1$
>- An increase in export revenue would cause AD to rise form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ and GPL to rise form $P_2$ to $P_3$
>- Expectation of higher inflation in the future would cause a fall in consumer confidence, causing AD to rise from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, pushing prices up from $P_3$ to $P_4$
>- This causes trade unions to demand even higher wages as the real wage of workers has fallen, causing the unit cost of production to rise even further, resulting in a wage price spiral
>- This is where inflation occurs due to the interlocking process due to increase in cost and increases in aggregate demand
## Consequences of inflation
### Consumers
- Inflation causes the cost of living to increase
- ==The cost of living is the cost of the basket of goods and services that yields a certain material standard of living==
- It rises with the GPL
- When there is inflation, households have to spend more money to maintain the same material standard of living
- **This depends on the inflation rate relative to the rate of increase of household's nominal (at current price levels)**
- If a households nominal income rises more slowly than the GPL, or remains unchanged during inflation, there would be a fall in real income
- Thus, there would be a fall in the amount of goods and services that the household can consume, resulting in a lower material standard of living
- On the other hand, if a households nominal income rises faster than the GPL during inflation, there would be a rise in real income
- Hence, there would be a rise in the material standard of living
---
- Households who earn variable income and own assets would be less negatively affected than those with fixed or no income
- Fixed income earners have their incomes fixed in monetary terms, and their real income would fall when there is inflation
### Producers
- The effect of inflation depends on the cause of inflation
- If inflation is demand-pull, profits tend to increase
- This is because the prices of goods and services tend to rise faster than unit costs of production
- In the short run, factor input prices tend to be unchanged because they are fixed by long term contracts
---
- If inflation is cost-push, profits tend to fall
- When the rise in cost of production is not due to rises in AD, firms will seek to pass the rise in unit cost of production onto consumers by raising prices
- However, they will not be able to fully pass the cost on to consumers, and end up absorbing some of the increase in unit cost of production, reducing profits
### Government - Economic growth and unemployment
#### Consumption and saving
- Inflation causes the real value of money to fall
- If inflation is low and stable, money is sitll a good store of value, and saving is not discouraged
- If inflation is high and rising, money becomes a poor store of value, and saving is discouraged
- Consumption is encouraged since the real value of savings is falling rapidly
- This is because people would want to spend their money as quickly as possible before its value falls further
- People would rather hold their wealth in the form of physical assets (gold, property) rather than money
- The fall in savings would also lead to lesser funds available for investment
#### Investment
- When inflation is low and stable, investment is encouraged, assuming nominal interest rate remains unchanged 
- Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
- This is because inflation reduces the real interest rate, causing the cost of borrowing, and the cost of investment
--- 
- A low inflation rate also provides more firms when making decisions, as they can take cues from the price mechanism to see if there is growing demand for their products
- With more certainty regarding the expected rate of returns on investment projects, firms will be more willing to invest
- This would lead to a rise in AD, as there is higher demand for capital goods, leading to a rise in real national output and a fall in unemployment
- It also leads to a rise in capital accumulation
- If the rate of capital accumulation exceeds capital deprecation, there would be a rise in capital stock and productive capacity, increasing AS, resulting in potential growth
- Hence, there is sustained economic growth

- But when inflation is high and rising, investment will be discouraged
- This would increase the uncertainty of making investment decisions, as it is harder for firms to predict their costs and revenues since inflation distorts price signals
- The expected rate of returns are more volatile, and firms are less willing to invest
- Thus investment is discouraged
- This would lead to a fall in AD, and a slower rise in AS
---
- Demand-pull inflation would cause the prices of goods and services to rise faster than unit costs of production
- This would increase the expected rate of return to rise, and firms would be more willing to invest, leading to sustained economic growth

- If inflation is cost-push, firms may hold back investment as firms would try to pass on the rise in unit costs of production onto consumers, but cannot fully do so
- This would lead to a fall in profits as firms have to absorb some of the costs
- This would cause investment to fall, leading to a fall in AD and a slower rise in AS, affecting actual and potential growth
---
- If cost-push inflation keeps persisting, and the causes of cost-push inflation are local in origin, domestic firms and foreign firms that have direct investment in the country may relocate to other countries
- This would result in a fall in potential growth
### Government - Equity
#### Fixed VS Variable Income earners
- Fixed income earners have their income fixed in nominal terms, and their real income will fall when there is inflation
- Variable income earner may gain, if their rate of increase of nominal income exceeds inflation rate, causing them to enjoy rising real wages over time
#### Borrowers VS Lenders
- Borrowers gain and savers lose as inflation causes the real interest rate and real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned to fall
- Inflation reduces the real value of money
- When loans are made, interest is charged at the nominal interest rate when the loan contract is determined
- If inflation occurs during the loan period, the real value of the debt and interest paid by the borrower to the lender will be lower than expected
- If the inflation is unanticipated, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the rise in prices, and the real interest rate will be lower than the nominal interest rate
- If the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate will have a negative value
- The real value of the amount received by the lender when the loan matures would be lower than the real value of the debt at the start period
- Lenders are mostly households that typically save a portion of their income in banks, while borrowers include consumers, firms and government
- As borrowers gain while lenders lose, there is an arbitrary distribution of income amongst households, households and firms, and households and the government
#### Government VS Taxpayers
- Assuming a progressive tax structure, inflation causes the government to gain and taxpayers to lose
- When there is inflation, wage-price spiral may set in where workers demand higher wages to enable them to cope with the rising cost of living
- When workers receive higher wages, this pushes them into higher marginal tax brackets, known as bracket creep
- They will have to pay a larger portion of their nominal income in taxes, even though real income may not have increased
- Thus, the government gains more tax revenue and taxpayers face falling real disposable income
### Government - Efficiency
#### Distortion of price mechanism
- In a market economy, price provide important signals to producers and consumers in their production or consumption decisions
- Inflation distorts the information that flows from price signals
- Due to scarcity, it is important that resources be allocated in a way which maximises society’s welfare to achieve allocative efficiency.
- When there is inflation, producers cannot distinguish there is a change in prices due to a rise in demand or due to inflation
- Should the producer mistake it for a rise in demand, he may allocate more resources towards production of that good, leading to a misallocation of resources, reducing efficiency
#### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices, including deciding on new prices, changing price labels and printing menus or catalogs
- With low inflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and menu costs become minor costs
- With high inflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly as they will have to change prices often to keep up with other prices in the economy
- This is considered wastage as they could have been used for other purposes that contribute to higher economic wellbeing
## Deflation
- Deflations is the sustained decrease in the general price level
- Occurs when the inflation rate is negative
## Demand-side deflation
- Deflation is caused by falling AD, and is associated with a prolonged and severe economic recession
- AD can be falling due to 
	- decreases in foreigners' income which causes them to lower spending on the country's exports
	- credit crunches following a financial crisis, leasing to decreases in consumer and investment spending
	- fiscal austerity, where a government cuts its spending
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand side deflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially in equilibrium at GPL $P_1$ and national output level $Y_1$
>- AD falls (explain the fall in AD)
>- This causes firms to respond by lowering output by hiring lesser factors of prodcution
>- The resulting rise in unemployment means that firms are better able to get the resources they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations
>- This lower unit cost of production, and firms are willing to sell the lower output at lower prices, causing GPL to fall to $P_2$ and national output to fall to $Y_2$
>- Once there is a fall in the GPL, there are likely to be further decreases in AD and hence persistent falls in the GPL
>- This is because once there is a fall in the GPL, consumers expect prices to fall further and would postpone their spending
>- This results in AD falling again and subsequent decreases in the GPL and national output
## Supply-side deflation
- Increases in AS lead to a decrease in the GPL and hence an increase in national output
- Increases in AS could be due to
	- Decreases in imported inputs like oil, driving down the unit cost of production, causing short-run AS to rise
	- Appreciation of the foreign exchange rate, which decreases prices of imported inputs and hence decreases unit cost of production, causing short-run AS to rise
	- Improvement in technology and hence productivity, which increases the country's productive capacity and lowers unit cost of production, causing AS to rise
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[supply side deflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially in equilibrium at GPL $P_1$ and national output level $Y_1$
>- AS rises (explain the rise in AS)
>- Firms will respond by increasing quantity supplied at each price level due to to the fall in unit cost of production
>- With excess AS, firms will have to cut prices to stimulate spending and reduce the excess supply
>- The GPL falls to $P_1$, while national output rises to $Y_2$
>- If unit cost of production falls persistently, then GPL will fall persistently
- Supply-side deflation is good deflation as national output rises while prices fall
## Consequences of deflation
### Consumers
- Impact depends on the type of deflation, income, and time period
- Assuming no change in household's nominal income, deflation results in a rise in household's real income
- This results in an improvement in standard of living as consumers are able to purchase more goods and services for consumption due to the fall in prices
---
- In times of demand side deflation, nominal income remains unchanged only in the short-run when wage contracts are still in force, or if the household is a fixed income earner
- In the long run, the household's nominal income should eventually fall when wage contracts expire and firms lower nominal wage rates
- The impact of deflation on a households real income now depends at the rate of decrease of nominal income against the rate decrease of the GPL
- In addition, deflation is likely to lead to further leftwards shifts in AD as households hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases in prices
- This would lead to falls in households real income, lowering material standards of living
---
- In times of supply-side inflation, with nominal income remaining unchanged in the short run, deflation would lead to a rise in households real income
- In the long run, nominal income like wages will be rising because firms will raise wage rate in their attempts to hire more workers to increase output
- This will slow down the fall in unit cost of production that was causing the deflation, but as long as GPL is falling and households nominal income is rising or constant, their real income will rise
- This will lead to a rise in material standard of living as households have more purchasing power and can buy more goods and services 
### Producers
- Impact depends on the type of deflation
-  If deflation is due to falling AD, profit margins tend to fall as the prices of goods and services are falling faster than the firm's unit cost of production
- If deflation is due to rising AS, profit margins are likely to rise as the decline in price of goods and services is lesser than the decline in the unit cost f production
- This is because the demand and supply of goods are not perfectly price elastic
- Firms will not fully pass on the fall in the unit cost of production
### Government  - Economic growth and unemployment
- Impact depends on the type of deflation, and state of the economy
#### Demand-side deflation
**Consumption and saving**
- When there is demand-side deflation, households tent to hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases in prices, causing consumption to fall
- Moreover, the fall in asset prices in times of deflation would reduce the real value of households wealth, causing them to have lesser purchasing power
- They will demand lesser goods and services, causing a fall in consumption
- The fall in GPL also causes a rise in the real interest rate as real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
- The real interest rate is the opportunity cost of consumption and the cost of borrowing
- Hence, this will encourage more saving and lesser consumption, causing a fall in consumption
**Investment**
- With the rise in real interest rate, firms will be discouraged from investing since the cost of borrowing rises
- If deflation encourage consumers to defer consumption, which lowers AD, the expected rate of return of investment falls, discouraging investment
**Overall**
- The fall in consumption and investment and hence AD causes further falls in the GPL and national output
- This implies negative actual economic growth
- Unemployment will also rise
- It will also lower potential growth as there is a slowdown in the expansion of the country's capital stock
- This is reflected by the AS curve shifting to the right more slowly
- If the rate of capital accumulation is now lesser than the rate of capital depreciation, the capital stock shrinks, and there is negative potential growth
#### Supply-side deflation
- If the fall in the GPL is supply-led, the effect on the economy should not be adverse as AD rises through the wealth, international substitution, and interest rate effects, leading to a rise in GDP
- But, the increases in the real interest rate discourages consumption and investment, as the cost of borrowing has risen
- The fall in prices may also cause households to defer consumption
- But, since national income is rising, consumer and business sentiments may be positive and AD may not fall
- If supply side deflation is caused by a fall in the unit cost of production, but the economy is weak, then the effect of anticipation of further fall in prices is more likely to prevail given weak consumer sentiments
- This will trigger a fall in AD, which will reduce national output
### Government - Equity

#### Fixed VS variable income earners
- Fixed income earners gain during deflation
- Their incomes are fixed in nominal terms and hence their real income will rise when there is deflation since deflation increases the real value of money
- Unionised workers with strong bargaining power may gain during deflation
- If they can resist wage cuts, a fall in the GPL would lead to rising real wages
#### Creditors VS debtors
- Debtors lose and creditors gain
- This is because the real interest rate and the real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned rises
- When loans are made, interest is charged at the nominal interest rate when the loan contract is determined
- If deflation is unexpected, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the fall in prices, and the real interest rate will be higher than the nominal; interest rate
- If deflation occurs during the loan period, the real value of the debt and interest will be higher than expected than if there was no change in the GPL
- There is an arbitrary distribution of income between households, between households and firms, and between households and the government
### Government - Allocative efficiency
#### Distortion of price mechanism
- Deflation makes it hard for producers to tell whether the fall in price of their product is a result of a decrease in demand for the product, or a result of general deflation
- The producer can mistake a fall in the price of the product due to deflation as a fall in its demand, and would allocate lesser resources to produce it
- This leads to misallocation of resources and allocative inefficiency
#### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices, including deciding on new prices, changing price labels and printing menus or catalogs
- With low deflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and menu costs become minor costs
- With high deflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly as they will have to change prices often to keep up with other prices in the economy
- This is considered wastage as they could have been used for other purposes that contribute to higher economic wellbeing
