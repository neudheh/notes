## Inflation and deflation
- ==Inflation is a situation where there is a sustained increase (3-4 years) in the general price level of an economy==
- The general price level is the average price of all goods and services in the economy during a period of time
- Inflation is economy wide, and is not the increase in pries of certain items only due to a temporary increase in demand
- Inflation is a continued increase in the GPL, not a one-time increase
- The inflation rate is the rate of change of the general price level
- The consumer price index measures the changes in the price of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by the average household over time
### Other terms
- **Stagflation**: High unemployment and rapid inflation, with negligible or even negative economic growth
- **Deflation**: Sustained decrease in the 
- **Disinflation**: Inflation rate is still positive, but declining over time
## Real value of money
- The real value of money is the purchasing power, or the quantity of goods and services it can buy
- When there is inflation, the GPL rises and the real value of money falls
- This is because the same amount of money can now buy fewer units of goods and services
- Internal value of money is the domestic purchasing power, how many units of goods/ services one unit of local currency can buy
- External value of money is the foreign exchange rate, how many units of foreign currency one unit of local currency can buy in the forex market
## Causes of inflation
### Demand-pull inflation
- Result of increasing AD
- Happens when the economy is near or at full employment
- Associated with a booming economy, when the economy is producing near full employment levels of output, and there is a lack of spare capacity

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL of $P_{1}$ and national output of $Y_{1}$
> - When AD rises form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$, profit motivated firms respond by increasing production
> - When firms increase output and operate closer to the full employment level of output, production becomes less efficient
> - They will used to resources that are less and less suitable for production
> - Thus, more labour and other inputs are needed per additional unit of output produced, causing the unit cost of production to rise
> - Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices
> - Hence, a rise in AD causes a rise in national output, but also leads to a rise in the GPL
> - If AD rises further, with the increased scarcity of resources, the GPL rises further with lesser increase in national output
> - Once $Y_f$ is reached, further rises in AD would only lead to a rise in GPL

- AD can rise due to Non-Monetary factors ([[13. AD-AS Model]])
	- (Increased consumer spending (**C**), increased investment spending (**I**), Increased government spending (**G**), increased export revenue (**X-M**))
- AD can also rise due to monetary factors
	- When the money supply rises and exceeds money demand, the public will convert the excess money into physical assets by spending it on goods and services
	- This causes consumption to rise, boosting AD
	- But, if the economy is near of at full employment, the GPL would rise, as there is too much money chasing after fewer goods and services in an economy
### Cost-push inflation
- Results of increasing unit cost of production (SRAS)

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL of $P_{1}$ and national output of $Y_{1}$
>- When there is a rise in the unit cost of production, firms will only be willing to continue producing the same level of output only if they receive higher prices
>- Thus, AS falls from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
>- Equilibrium GPL rises to $P_2$ as firms pass the higher unit costs of production onto consumer as higher prices. while equilibrium national output drops to $Y_2$
>- If the cost push pressure continues, then AS continues to fall, causing the horizontal AS section continues to shift up, and GPL continues to rise

- A fall in AS causes stagflation, where prices rise and real national output falls
### Causes of cost-push inflation
#### Wage-push
- Countries with shrinking labour forces may suffer wage-push inflation
	- The labour force may decline due to ageing population or govt policies on immigration and foreign labour
	- This would cause labour shortages, driving up wage rates
- Trade unions can also push up wage rates independently of the demand for labour
	- Trade unions force firms to pay higher wages or else they would strike
	- When wage rate rise faster than the rise in labour productivity, inflation may set in due to the rising unit costs of production
	- When trade unions can push wage rate by a larger extent more than improvements in labour productivity, there would be repeated supply shocks and rises in the GPL
#### Imported inflation
- An increase in the price of imported inputs which are key inputs for many products would cause a rise in the unit cost of production
- This would cause the GPL to rise as firms pass on the higher unit cost of production onto consumers, as they would not be willing to produce if their marginal revenue is lesser than the unit cost of production
#### Depreciation of foreign exchange rate
- Deprecation of the local currency would result in the price of imported inputs in terms of local currency, causing unit costs of production to rise
- This would cause the GPL to rise as firms pass on the higher unit cost of production onto consumers, as they would not be willing to produce if their marginal revenue is lesser than the unit cost of production
#### Tax-push
- A rise in indirect taxes like GST would increase the unit cost of production
- Firms will pass on these taxes to consumers by raising prices, increasing GPL
- The rising cost of living would cause workers to ask for higher wages to maintain their current purchasing power
- Thus there is further increase in the UCOP, resulting GPL to rise more than once (wage-price spiral)

### Interaction of demand-pull and cost-push inflation

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Rise in AD/ Fall in AS
>- A rise in AD (due to a rise in export revenue) would cause trade unions bargaining for higher wages as they do not want workers' purchasing power to fall
>- This causes the UCOP to rise, resulting in cost-push inflation
>- There will also be shortages in the labour market as a result of rising AD, strengthening trade union's bargaining power and they may demand further increases in wage rates
>How it causes inflation
>- Economy is initially in equilibrium with GPL of $P_1$ and output $Y_1$
>- An increase in export revenue would cause AD to rise form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ and GPL to rise form $P_2$ to $P_3$
>- Expectation of higher inflation in the future would cause a fall in consumer confidence, causing AD to rise from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, pushing prices up from $P_3$ to $P_4$
>- This causes trade unions to demand even higher wages as the real wage of workers has fallen, causing the unit cost of production to rise even further, resulting in a wage price spiral
>- This is where inflation occurs due to the interlocking process due to increase in cost and increases in aggregate demand
## Consequences of inflation
### Consumers
- Inflation causes the cost of living to increase
- ==The cost of living is the cost of the basket of goods and services that yields a certain material standard of living==
- It rises with the GPL
- When there is inflation, households have to spend more money to maintain the same material standard of living
- **This depends on the inflation rate relative to the rate of increase of household's nominal (at current price levels)**
- If a households nominal income rises more slowly than the GPL, or remains unchanged during inflation, there would be a fall in real income
- Thus, there would be a fall in the amount of goods and services that the household can consume, resulting in a lower material standard of living
- On the other hand, if a households nominal income rises faster than the GPL during inflation, there would be a rise in real income
- Hence, there would be a rise in the material standard of living
---
- Households who earn variable income and own assets would be less negatively affected than those with fixed or no income
- Fixed income earners have their incomes fixed in monetary terms, and their real income would fall when there is inflation
### Producers
- The effect of inflation depends on the cause of inflation
- If inflation is demand-pull, profits tend to increase
- This is because the prices of goods and services tend to rise faster than unit costs of production
- In the short run, factor input prices tend to be unchanged because they are fixed by long term contracts
---
- If inflation is cost-push, profits tend to fall
- When the rise in cost of production is not due to rises in AD, firms will seek to pass the rise in unit cost of production onto consumers by raising prices
- However, they will not be able to fully pass the cost on to consumers, and end up absorbing some of the increase in unit cost of production, reducing profits
### Government - Economic growth and unemployment
#### Consumption and saving
- Inflation causes the real value of money to fall
- If inflation is low and stable, money is sitll a good store of value, and saving is not discouraged
- If inflation is high and rising, money becomes a poor store of value, and saving is discouraged
- Consumption is encouraged since the real value of savings is falling rapidly
- This is because people would want to spend their money as quickly as possible before its value falls further
- People would rather hold their wealth in the form of physical assets (gold, property) rather than money
- The fall in savings would also lead to lesser funds available for investment
#### Investment
- When inflation is low and stable, investment is encouraged, assuming nominal interest rate remains unchanged 
- Real interest rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
- This is because inflation reduces the real interest rate, causing the cost of borrowing, and the cost of investment
--- 
- A low inflation rate also provides more firms when making decisions, as they can take cues from the price mechanism to see if there is growing demand for their products
- With more certainty regarding the expected rate of returns on investment projects, firms will be more willing to invest
- This would lead to a rise in AD, as there is higher demand for capital goods, leading to a rise in real national output and a fall in unemployment
- It also leads to a rise in capital accumulation
- If the rate of capital accumulation exceeds capital deprecation, there would be a rise in capital stock and productive capacity, increasing AS, resulting in potential growth
- Hence, there is sustained economic growth

- But when inflation is high and rising, investment will be discouraged
- This would increase the uncertainty of making investment decisions, as it is harder for firms to predict their costs and revenues since inflation distorts price signals
- The expected rate of returns are more volatile, and firms are less willing to invest
- Thus investment is discouraged
- This would lead to a fall in AD, and a slower rise in AS
---
- Demand-pull inflation would cause the prices of goods and services to rise faster than unit costs of production
- This would increase the expected rate of return to rise, and firms would be more willing to invest, leading to sustained economic growth

- If inflation is cost-push, firms may hold back investment as firms would try to pass on the rise in unit costs of production onto consumers, but cannot fully do so
- This would lead to a fall in profits as firms have to absorb some of the costs
- This would cause investment to fall, leading to a fall in AD and a slower rise in AS, affecting actual and potential growth
---
- If cost-push inflation keeps persisting, and the causes of cost-push inflation are local in origin, domestic firms and foreign firms that have direct investment in the country may relocate to other countries
- This would result in a fall in potential growth
### Government - Equity
#### Fixed VS Variable Income earners
- Fixed income earners have their income fixed in nominal terms, and their real income will fall when there is inflation
- Variable income earner may gain, if their rate of increase of nominal income exceeds inflation rate, causing them to enjoy rising real wages over time
#### Borrowers VS Lenders
- Borrowers gain and savers lose as inflation causes the real interest rate and real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned to fall
- Inflation reduces the real value of money
- When loans are made, interest is charged at the nominal interest rate when the loan contract is determined
- If inflation occurs during the loan period, the real value of the debt and interest paid by the borrower to the lender will be lower than expected
- If the inflation is unanticipated, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the rise in prices, and the real interest rate will be lower than the nominal interest rate
- If the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate will have a negative value
- The real value of the amount received by the lender when the loan matures would be lower than the real value of the debt at the start period
- Lenders are mostly households that typically save a portion of their income in banks, while borrowers include consumers, firms and government
- As borrowers gain while lenders lose, there is an arbitrary distribution of income amongst households, households and firms, and households and the government
#### Government VS Taxpayers
- Assuming a progressive tax structure, inflation causes the government to gain and taxpayers to lose
- When there is inflation, wage-price spiral may set in where workers demand higher wages to enable them to cope with the rising cost of living
- When workers receive higher wages, this pushes them into higher marginal tax brackets, known as bracket creep
- They will have to pay a larger portion of their nominal income in taxes, even though real income may not have increased
- Thus, the government gains more tax revenue and taxpayers face falling real disposable income
### Government - Efficiency
#### Distortion of price mechanism
- In a market economy, price provide important signals to producers and consumers in their production or consumption decisions
- Inflation distorts the information that flows from price signals
- Due to scarcity, it is important that resources be allocated in a way which maximises society’s welfare to achieve allocative efficiency.
- When there is inflation, producers cannot distinguish there is a change in prices due to a rise in demand or due to inflation
- Should the producer mistake it for a rise in demand, he may allocate more resources towards production of that good, leading to a misallocation of resources, reducing efficiency
#### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices, including deciding on new prices, changing price labels and printing menus or catalogs
- With low inflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and menu costs become minor costs
- With high inflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly as they will have to change prices often to keep up with other prices in the economy
- This is considered wastage as they could have been used for other purposes that contribute to higher economic wellbeing
## Deflation
- Deflations is the sustained decrease in the general price level
- Occurs when the inflation rate is negative
## Demand-side deflation
- Deflation is caused by falling AD, and is associated with a prolonged and severe economic recession
## Supply-side deflation
## Consequences of deflation
