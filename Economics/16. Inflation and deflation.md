## Inflation
- ==Inflation is a situation where there is sustained (continued, not one-off) increase in the general price level of an economy==
- ==The general price level is the average price of all goods and services in an economy during a period of time==
- The general price level is the average price of all goods and services in the economy during a period of time
- Inflation is economy wide, and is not the increase in pries of certain items only due to a temporary increase in demand
- Inflation rate is the rate of change in the general price level 
- The consumer price index measures the change in price of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by the average household over time
### Other terms
- **Stagflation** - A situation of high unemployment and rapid inflation with negligible growth or even contraction of the national output
- **Deflation** - A sustained decrease in the general price level of an economy
- **Disinflation** - A period where the inflation rate is positive, but declining over time
### Real value of money
- The real value of a unit of money its its purchasing power, or the quantity of goods and services it can buy
- The GPL and the real value of money are inversely related
- Inflation leads to a decrease in the real value of money
- When the prices of goods and services rise in general, the same amount of money can now buy fewer units of goods and services
- Internal value of money is its domestic purchasing power - how many units of a good/ service one unit of local currency is able to buy within one country
- External value of money is its foreign exchange rate - how many units of foreign currency one unit of local currency can buy in the foreign exchange market
## Causes of inflation
### Demand-pull inflation
- Demand pull inflation is the caused by rising AD when the economy is near or at full employment
- Typically associated with a booming economy
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand pull inflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL of $P_1$ and national output of $Y_1$
>- When AD rises from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$, profit motivated firms will see a fall in inventories
>- They will increase production by hiring more factors of production
>- When firms increase output and operate closer to the productive capacity or full employment level of output, production becomes less efficient
>- Firms will be forced to use resources that are less and less suitable for their production
>- Thus, increasingly larger amounts of labor and other inputs are required per additional unit of output produced
>- This causes the unit cost of production to rise
>- Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices
>- Hence, while the rise in AD lead to a rise in national output, it also led to an increase in the GPL
>- When AD rises further form $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, with the increased scarcity of resources, the GPL is further pulled up with limited increases in national output
>- Once $Y_f$ is reached, continued increases in AD will lead to an increase in GPL only
### Causes of demand pull inflation
- AD can rise due to non-monetary factors ([[Economics/13. AD-AS Model]])
	- Increased consumer spending (C), Increased investment spending (I), Increased export revenue (X-M), or increased government spending
- AD can also rise due to monetary factors
	- When the monetary supply increases and exceeds money demand, the public will convert the excess money into physical assets by spending it on goods
	- This leads to a rise in consumer spending, increasing AD
	- But, if the economy is near or at full employment, prices will be pulled up
	- Inflation occurs as there is too much money chasing after too few goods and services in the economy
### Cost-push inflation
- This is a situation in which prices are pushed upward by continual increases in unit costs of production which are not caused by increases in AD
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[cost push inflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium with a GPL of $P_1$ and national output of $Y_1$
>- When there is a rise in unit cost of production, profit motivated firms will be willing to continue producing the same output level only if they receive higher prices
>- Thus AS falls, which is seen as the horizontal segment of AS shifting up to $AS_2$
>- This causes equilibrium GPL to rise to $P_2$ as firms pass the higher unit costs on to consumers as higher prices, while equilibrium national output shifts to $Y_2$
>- If the cost-push pressure continues, then AS continues to fall, and the horizontal section of AS continues to shift up, and the GPL continues to rise
- A fall in AS causes stagflation, where prices rise and real national output falls
### Causes of cost-push inflation
#### Wage push
- Countries with a shrinking labor force might suffer wage-push inflation
- Labor forces might decline due to an aging population or government policies on immigration and foreign labor
- This an lead to labor shortages, driving up wage rates
-  Trade unions also push up wage rates independently of the demand for labor, forcing firms to pay higher wages under the threat of labor strikes
- When the wage rate rises faster than the rise in labor productivity, inflation may set in due to the rising labor cost
- When trade unions are able to push up wage rates by a larger extent than improvements in labor productivity year after year, there will be repeated supply shocks and a persistent rise in the GPL
#### Imported inflation
- Cost push inflation can arise from an increase in the prices of imported inputs which are the key inputs to a variety of products
- An increase in the price of crude oil drives up the price of energy, a necessary input ion any production process
- The resulting rise in the unit cost of production pushes up the prices of almost all products
- There is an increase in the GPL as the AS would be shifting up as it falls
#### Depreciation of the foreign exchange rate
- A depreciation of a country's currency results in the increase in prices of imported inputs in terms of local curreency
- This causes a rise in the unit cost of production, and a fall in AS, causing higher prices
#### Tax-push inflation
- A rise in broad based indirect taxes like GST will lead to a rise in the GPL as it raises the unit cost of production
- Producers, to protect their profit margins, will pass on the taxes to consumers by raising prices, causing an increase in the GPL
- Workers may then ask for higher wages to maintain their purchasing power, and there will be further increases in the unit cost of production
- This would lead to further increases in the GPL
## Interaction between demand-pull and cost-push inflation
>[!EXAMPLE]
>Rise in AD/ Fall in AS
>![[both demand pull and cost push inflation.png]]
>- A rise in AD (due to a rise in export revenue) would cause trade unions to bargain for higher wages as they do not want workers' purchasing power to fall
>- This causes the UCOP to rise, resulting in cost-push inflation
>- There will also be shortages in the labour market as a result of rising AD, strengthening trade union's bargaining power and they may demand further increases in wage rates
>**How it causes inflation**
>- Economy is initially in equilibrium with GPL of $P_1$ and output $Y_1$
>- An increase in export revenue would cause AD to rise form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ and GPL to rise form $P_2$ to $P_3$
>- Expectation of higher inflation in the future would cause a fall in consumer confidence, causing AD to rise from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, pushing prices up from $P_3$ to $P_4$
>- This causes trade unions to demand even higher wages as the real wage of workers has fallen, causing the unit cost of production to rise even further, resulting in a wage price spiral
>- This is where inflation occurs due to the interlocking process due to increase in cost and increases in aggregate demand
## Effects of inflation
### Consumers
- Inflation causes the cost of living to increase
- The cost of living is the cost of the basket of goods and services that yield a certain standard of living
- It rises with the general price level; when there is inflation, households have to spend more money to maintain the same level of material living standards
- The effect inflation has on household's material standard of living depends on the inflation rate relative to the rate of increase of household's nominal income
- If a household's nominal income rises more slowly than the GPL, or if the nominal income remains unchanged in times of inflation, there will be a fall in real income
- Thus, they can consume lesser goods and services, resulting in a lower standard of living
- If a household's nominal income rises more than the GPL, they will experience a rise in their real income, and see a rise in their standard of living
- But, this increase in material SOL may not be large as it is offset by a higher cost of living
- Households that own variable income and own assets will be less negatively affected than those with fixed or no income 
- For fixed income earner such as retired pensioners, their incomes are fixed in monetary terms and hence their real income will fall when there is inflation
### Producers
- Inflation affect's firms profit margins
- The effect on firm's profits depends on the cause of inflation
- If inflation is demand pull, profit margins will increase because the prices of goods and services tend to rise faster than the unit cost of production
- In the short-run, factor input prices tend to be unchanged because they are fixed by long-term contracts
- If inflation is cost-push, firms profit margins will decrease because they will seek to pass on the rise in unit cost of production
- But, they cannot pass on the increase in unit cost of production fully on to consumers
- Since they absorb part of the increase in unit cost, they will see a fall in profit margins
### Government perspective - economic growth and unemployment
#### Consumption and saving
- Inflation causes the real value of money to fall
- If inflation is low and stable, money is still a goods store of value and saving is not discouraged
- If inflation is high and rising, money becomes a poor store of value
- Consumption is encouraged and saving is discouraged as the real value of savings is falling rapidly
- This is because with prices rising rapidly, people would want to spend it as quick as possible before its value falls further
- This spending further fuels inflation
- The fall in saving would also lead to lesser funds available for investment
#### Investment
- When inflation is low and stable, investment is encouraged, assuming nominal interest rate remains unchanged
- This is becuase inflation reduces the real interest rate and hence the real cost of borrowing by firms for investment $$Real\ interest\ rate = nominal\ interest\ rate - inflation\ rate$$
- A low and stable rate of inflation provides more certainty for firms when making investment decisions
- Firms can take cues from the price mechanism in determining whether there is growing demand from their products
- With more certainty regarding the expected rate of returns on investment projects, firms will be more willing to invest
- This would cause a rise in AD, since there is higher demand for capital goods, leading to an increase in real national output and a reduction in unemployment
- Also, the increase in investment leads to an accumulation of capital goods, assuming the rate of capital accumulation exceeds the rate of capital deprecation
- This will increase AS, causing it to shift to the right, resulting in potential growth
- Thus, there is sustained economic growth
---
- But, when inflation is high and rising, investment will be discouraged
- High levels of inflation increase the uncertainty of investment decisions, making it difficult for firms to predict their costs and revenue since inflation distorts price signals
- The expected rate of returns is volatile, and investment will be discouraged
- This would lead to a fall in AD and AS
---
- If inflation is demand-pull, the prices of goods and services will rise faster than unit costs of production
- This will increase the expected rate of return on investment, leading to more investment by firms
- If inflation is cost-push, firms may hold back on investment as profitability is likely to be lowered
- This would cause decreases in AD and slower increases in AS over time, adversely affecting the country's actual and potential growth performance
- If cost-push inflation keeps persisting, and the causes of cost-push inflation are local in origin, domestic firms and foreign firms that have invested in the country may relocate
- This would to a reduction in potential national output (negative potential growth)
### Government - Equity
#### Fixed vs. variable income earners
- Fixed income earners lose during inflation, as their income is fixed in nominal terms and their real income will fall when there is inflation
- Variable income earners may gain during inflation
- Variable income earners are people whose nominal income varies from period to period
- If their annual nominal wage increases more quickly than the general price level, they could enjoy rising real wages over time
- These are likely to be workers with strong bargaining power
#### Savers vs. borrowers
- Lenders are mainly households who typically save a portion of their income in banks or use it to buy bonds
- Borrowers are consumers, firms or the government
- Borrowers gain and savers lose when there is inflation because inflation causes the real interest rate and the real value of the amount borrowed to fall
- Inflation reduces the real value of money
- If inflation occurs during the loan period, the real value of the debt and the interest paid will be lower than expected than if there was no change in the GPL
- This nominal interest rate is set when the loan contract is determined
- If inflation in unanticipated, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the rise in prices and the real interest rate will be lower
- If the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate will have a negative value
- This means that the value of the amount received by the lender when the loan matures will be lower than the real value of the debt at the start of the loan period
#### Government vs. taxpayers
- Assuming a progressive tax structure, inflation causes the government to gain and taxpayers to lose
- When there is inflation, wage-price spiral may eventually set in, where workers demand higher nominal wages to cope with the rising cost of living
- The rising wages of taxpayers pushes them into the higher tax brackets, known as bracket creep
- As a result, they have to pay a larger portion of their nominal income in terms of taxes, even though their real income may not have increased
- Thus the government gains more tax revenue and income taxpayers face falling real disposable income in times of inflation
### Government - Efficiency
#### Distortion of the price mechanism
- Prices provide important signals to producers and consumers in their production or consumption decisions
- Inflation distorts the information that flows from price signals
- When there is inflations, it may be difficult for a producer to distinguish whether a change in prices is due to an increase in actual demand or due to inflation
- Should the producer mistake the rise in prices as an increase in demand for their productions, they may allocate more resources to production of the good
- This leads to a misallocation of resources, leading to allocative inefficiency
#### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices
- With low inflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and is considered a minor cost
- When there is high inflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly, as they have to change prices to keep up with all other prices in the economy
## Deflation
- Deflation is a sustained decrease in the general price level
- It occurs when the inflation rate is negative
## Causes of deflation
### Demand-side deflation
- Deflation is caused by falling AD and is associated with a prolonged and severe economic recession
- AD could be falling due to decreases in consumer spending ($C$), decreases in investment spending ($I$), decreases in government spending ($G$), and decreases in net export revenue ($X-M$)
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand side deflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially in equilibrium at GPL $P_1$ and national output level $Y_1$
>- AD falls, causing firms to see a rise in inventories
>- They will respond by employing lesser factors of production
>- The resulting rise in unemployment means that firms are better able to get the resources that the need, resulting in more efficient combinations
>- The unit cost of production is falling, and firms are now more willing to sell the lower output at lower prices
>- Once there is a fall in the GPL, there are likely to be further decreases in AD and a persistent fall in the GPL
>- Consumers expect prices to drop further and postpone their current spending, causing AD to fall further
### Supply-side deflation
- Increases in AS lead to a decrease in GPL and increase in national output
- Increases in AS could be due to
	- Decreases in prices of imported inputs like crude oil, lowering the unit cost of production and causing horizontal AS to lower and shift down
	- Appreciation of the exchange rate, causing the prices on imported inputs to fall and decrease the unit cost of production, causing horizontal AS to lower and shift down
	- Improvement in technology and hence increases in factor productivity, increasing productive capacity and lowers unit cost of production, causing AS to shift down
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[supply side deflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL $P_1$ and national output $Y_1$
>- AS rises, and firms respond by increasing quantity supplied at each level
>- With excess AS, firms will have to cut prices to stimulate spending so that they can reduce the extra supply
>- Thus the GPL falls to $P_2$ and national output rises to $Y_2$
## Effects of deflation
### Consumers
- Deflation causes a decrease in the cost of living for households
- Assuming no change in nominal income, deflation results in a rise in household's real income
- This would result in an improvement in the material standard of living as consumers are able to purchase more goods and services for consumption due to fall in prices
- In times of demand-side deflation, nominal income remains unchanged only in the short run (when wage contracts are still in force) or if the household is a fixed income earner
- In the long-run, the households nominal income will eventually fall when wage contracts expire and firms lower nominal wage rate
- The impact on deflation on a households real income thus depend on the rate of decrease of nominal income against the rate of decrease of the GPL
- Deflation is also likely to lead to decreases in AD becuase households hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases in prices
- This would lead to decreases in national output and hence household's real income, causing material standards of living to fall
---
- On the other hand, in terms of supply-side deflation, with nominal income remaining unchanged in in the short-run, deflation will lead to a rise in households real income
- In the long run, nominal income like wages will still be rising becuase firms will bid up wage rate in their attempts to hire more workers to increase output
- This slows down the fall in unit cost of production that was causing the deflation
- But, as long as GPL is falling and households nominal income is either constant or rising, their real income will be rising, leading to higher material standards of living
### Producers
- Deflation affects firm's profit margins
- If deflation is due to falling AD, profit margins tend to fall becuase the prices of goods and services are likely to be falling faster than the firm's cost of production
- If inflation is due to rising AS, profit margins are rising in the short run 
- This is becuase the decline in prices of goods and services is lesser than the decline in unit cost of production
- Firms will not fully pass on the lower cost of production
### Governments - Economic growth and unemployment
#### Consumption/ rise in saving
- When there is demand side deflation, households hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases in prices, causing consumption to fall
- The fall in asset prices during deflation also creates a negative wealth effect (e.g. decreases in property prices would dampen wealth and consumer confidence)
- This would lead to a fall in consumption
- The fall in the general price level would also lead to an increase in the real interest rate
- This raises the opportunity cost of consumption and borrowing
- A higher interest rate would encourage saving and discourage borrowing, thus discouraging consumption
#### Fall in investment
- With a rise in the real interest rate, firms will be discouraged from investing as the cost of borrowing rises
- If inflation causes consumers to defer consumption, lowering AD, the expected rate of return on investments falls, discouraging investment
#### Overall
- The fall in consumption and investment spending and hence AD lead to further decreases in the GPL and national output
- This implies negative actual economic growth if the economy was initially in equilibrium at just below full employment
- Unemployment will rise as well
- The decrease in investment will lower potential growth as it causes a slowdown in the expansion of the country's capital stock, and AS rises more slowly
- If investment falls the the point where the increase in capital stock from investments is now unable to compensate for capital depreciation, potential growth becomes negative
#### Supply-side
- If the fall in GPL is supply led, the effect on the macroeconomy is not adverse as AD rises through the real balances, international substitution and interest rate effects
- This leads to a rise in GDP and hence actual growth
- Supply side deflation however would lead to an increase in the real interest rate, discouraging consumption and investment
- The fall in prices may also cause households to defer consumption
- But, since national output/ income is rising, consumer and business sentiments are positive, and AD might not actually fall
- The impact of supply side deflation depends on the economy
- If it was caused by a fall in the price of inputs, but there are fundamental weaknesses in the health of the economy, then the effect of further falls in prices on consumption will be stronger given weak consumer sentiments
- This will trigger a fall in AD, and there will be a fall in national income, and there is negative actual growth
### Governments - Equity
#### Fixed vs. variable income earner
- Fixed income earners gain during inflation as their incomes are fixed in nominal terms and hence their real income will rise, as inflation increases the real value of money
- Unionized workers with strong bargaining power may gain as with their ability to resist wage cuts, falling GPL would lead to rising real wages
#### Creditors vs. debtors
- Lenders are mainly households who typically save a portion of their income in banks or use it to buy bonds
- Borrowers are consumers, firms or the government
- Debtors lose and creditors (lenders) gain as deflation causes the real interest rate and the real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned to rise
- When loans are made interest is charged
- If there is deflation during the loan period, the real value of the debt and interest paid by the debtor will be higher than expected
- The nominal interest rate is set when the loan contract is determined
- If the deflation is unexpected, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the fall in prices and the real interest rate will be higher than the nominal interest rate
### Governments - Efficiency
#### Distortion of price mechanism
- Deflation makes it hard for producers to discern whether a fall in price of products is a result of a fall in demand, or a result of deflation
- If the producer mistakes a fall in price of the product due to a fall in demand, and inaccurately devote lesser resources to produce it, there is a misallocation of resources
- There is allocative inefficiency
#### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices
- With low deflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and is considered a minor cost
- When there is high deflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly, as they have to change prices to keep up with all other prices in the economy
