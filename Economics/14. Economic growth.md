## Actual growth and potential growth
- ==Actual economic growth is the increase in actual national output==
- In the AD-AS model, actual national output is the equilibrium real national output
- A country's actual growth rate indicates whether the country's national output is rising or shrinking over time, and how rapidly national output is rising
- A country is in recession if it experiences two consecutive quarters of negative actual growth
- Potential growth is the increase in the capacity (potential) of the economy to produce 
- I.e. it refers to an expansion in a country's potential national output (full-employment national output)
## Tools of analysis for economic growth
### PPC and economic growth
- When a country moves from a point inside the PPC to a point closer or on the PPC, it is producing more of both goods, and there has been actual economic growth
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the economy's productive capacity (there has been potential economic growth
- When there are changes in quantity, quality or level of technology, there would be a shift of the PPC
### AD-AS model
- Since actual and potential growth are represented by changes in real and potential GDP, we will be using the AD-AS model
## Factors affecting actual growth
### Increase in AD
- AD is made up of consumption expenditure(C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports (X-M)
- If AD increase due to an increase in any of its components, equilibrium real national output will increase, resulting in actual growth, assuming there is spare capacity in the economy
- The rise in AD causes an unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to increease production by employing more factors of prodcution
- Through the multiplier process, there will be a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
![[actual growth increase in AD.png]]
### Fall in unit cost 
- When there is a fall in unit cost of production, AS rises
- The horizontal portion of AS shifts down, from $AS_0$ to $AS_1$
- There will be a fall in the GPL, and through the wealth/ interest rate/ international substitution effect, there will be a rise in GDP through a movement along AD
- Assuming AD remains constant, the rise in AS results in an increase in equilibrium real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- Thus, there is actual growth
![[actual growth fall in unit cost.png]]
## Factors affecting potential growth
- The rate of potential growth depends on supply-side factors (factors that affect the productive capacity)
- A country's productive capacity can be increased through an increase in the quantity of FOP, or the quality of FOPs
- When a country has more factor inputs, the maximum possible output that it can produce increase
- The productivity of a factor input is the output per unit of the factor input
- When a country's quantity of FOP is the same, but each unit of FOP can produce more, the maximum possible output that the country can produce increases
- When either quality or quantity of FOP increases, potential national output increases from $Yf_1$ to $Yf_2$
- AS will increase, reflected as a vertical portion shifting to the right
![[potential growth.png]]
### Increase in the quantity of FOPs
#### Capital
- A country's capital stock is tis collection of durable assets (equipment, factories) used to produce other goods and services
- When a country's capital stock increases, it can produce more goods and services, increasing the productive capacity of the economy
- A country's capital stock can increase through investment and shrink through capital depreciation
- As long as net investment (net investment = gross investment - capital depreciation) is positive, the capital stock will increase over time
- The level of investment consists of domestic and foreign investment
- Domestic investment is investment by domestic firms
	- It is affected by the level of saving, the interest rate, entrepreneur's confidence in the future business and economic outlook, and the corporate tax rate 
- Foreign investment is investment by foreign firms
	- It is affected by entrepreneur's confidence in the future business and economic outlook, corporate tax rate, exchange rate stability, and ease of doing business
#### Labour
- The quantity of labour by increasing the average working hours per worker, causing firms to be able to produce more goods and services with the same amount of workers
- The quantity of labour can also change through the size of the labour force
- The labour force refers to the manpower currently available in the economy
- It consists of people who are willing and able to work
- The size of the labour force depend on changes in population size/ structure, and foreign labour inflows
**Changes in population size/ structure**
- Changes in population size are due to changes in birth rates, death rate or migration
- With a larger population size, the size of the labour force would likely also be larger
- With an ageing population, there would be fewer younger workers joining the labour force, and more older worker that are retiring
- This would cause the labour force to shrink
**Foreign labour inflows**
- The inflow of foreign workers also increases the size of the labour force
- It depends on the attractiveness of works in the host country, and government policy towards migrant labour
#### Land
- A country's quantity of natural resources increases when there is discovery of new mineral deposits (e.g. oil fields, mines)
- A country's natural resources can become depleted, when renewable resources are used at a faster rate than they can be replenished
- This can be overcome to some extent by optimising land used, by building upwards or deeper
#### Entrepreneur
- Entrepreneurs bring different factors of production together to produce goods and services and bear the risk of making losses in undertaking production
- They also invest in R&D, which is needed for technological process, improving the potential growth rate
- We can encourage entrepreneurs by having legal framework, funding and culture
### Increase in the quality of FOPs
- The quality of an FOP is how productive it is
#### Measuring factor productivity
- We can measure labour productivity, which is the output obtained per unit of labour used in production
- We can also use total factor productivity, which is the amount of output given quantity of all the outputs used in production
#### Capital
- Investment in physical capital increases a country's capital stock, and also increases productivity of land and labour, helping to increase productive capacity
- E.g. Workers in a food-processing factory can produce more output per man hour if the firm invested in more food processors
- Each unit of labour now has more capital to work with and this can increase the productivity of labour
#### Human capital
- Human capital is the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training and experience
- Investment in human capital means spending on education and skills training/ upgrading
- Higher quality of human capital raises a nation's ability to produce goods and services through greater knowledge, higher skills, and hence higher productive capacity
#### Technology
- Advancements in technology in the form of process innovation will enable the same quantity of FOP to produce more in the same period
- Technological advancements from R&D, or transfer of knowledge from MNCs
- The ability of a nation to effect an sustain technological change depends on
	- Quality and size of the nation's education and training program
	- Level of investment in R&D
	- Existence of institutions that provide individuals with the ability and incentive to innovate and bring about technological progress
	- E.g. funds for investment, patents on new inventions
## Role of government in stimulating potential growth
- The government can do so through supply-side policies
- They can subsidise education and job skills training to improve human capital
- They can affect firms investment plans and influence their long run expectations on the rate of return of investment by affecting the economic stability of the country
## Sustained economic growth
- ==Sustained economic growth refers to a situation where an economy's real national output increases over an extended period, without accelerating inflation rates==
- Without an expansion of potential national output, increases in equilibrium real national output must come to an end
- This is because when the economy reaches full employment, the growth of equilibrium real national output will be restricted by the growth of potential national output
- To sustain actual growth in the long run, potential output must continue to rise through rises in vertical AS together with the rise in actual output through a rise in AD
![[sustained economic growth.png]]
- Assume that AD is at $AD_2$ and the economy is at equilibrium, where real national output is at $Y_2$ and there is spare capacity
- An increase in AD from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$ will raise the equilibrium real national output from $Y_2$ to $Y_f0$
	- There is a change in equilibrium from point **a** to point **b**
	- This increase in equilibrium real national output is actual growth
- For actual growth to be sustained, increases in AD alone are not enough, and there has to be an increase in potential national output
	- Otherwise, further increases in AD (e.g. $AD_4$) leads only to further increases in the GPL
- For equilibrium real national output to go beyond $Yf_0$, the increase in AD bust be accompanied by an increase in AS, where there is expansion in the country's potential capacity
	- I.e. AS curve shifts to $AS_1$
	- The outward shift of the vertical AS portion indicates potential potential growth, where there is an increase from full employment national output from $Yf_0$ to $Yf_1$
- When that happens, the economy can now achieve an equilibrium real national output beyond $Yf_0$
	- When AD increases to $AD_4$ along with the rise in potential national output, a new equilibrium is reached at point **c**, and actual growth happens again
- Governments aim for sustained growth where real GDP rises over time,  and the real GDP follows a rising long-term trend path
- One problem faced is the lack of growth in the long term, where the economy might stagnate due to sluggish AD and lack of increases in potential GDP
- They may also face unstable actual growth rate in the short-term
	- At times, the economy is in a boom, where the growth rate rises significantly above is trend rate, as AD is rising and there is sufficient capacity
	- At other times, the economy is in a bust, as AD falls or AS is falling, leading to negative growth rates
## Benefits of economic growth
### Households
- If actual economic growth exceeds population growth, it will lead to higher income per capita
- As consumers have more purchasing power, they will consume more goods and services, leading to higher material standard of living
- Economic growth can also mean an increase in government tax revenue collected through corporate tax, personal income tax and sales tax
- As the economy grows and income rises, the same tax rates will yield higher revenue for the government
- This increase in government revenue enables governments to increase spending on public goods (flood control), goods with positive externalities (education) and public amenities
- This increases material standard of living
- Governments can also increase spending on cleaning up the environment, increasing non-material standard of living
### Government
#### Macroeconomic problems
- Actual growth helps to reduce demand deficient unemployment
- If the economic growth is driven by a rise in AD, there will be a rise in real output, assuming the economy is below full employment
- When output increases, employment will fall as firms hire more workers to produce the increase in output
- Potential growth is important for living standards to rise over time without compromising the macroeconomic goal of general price stability
- This is because when AD continues to rise, the economy will eventually reach the full employment output
- Without a growth in productive capacity, further rises in AD will only cause demand-pull inflation, without an increase in real output, reducing the purchasing power of citizens
#### Redistributive benefits
- When real national output/ income is unchanged, a redistribution of income to improve equality would make one group better off while another worse off
- If real national income rises, even by maintaining a constant tax rates, the government can distribute more income from the rich to the poor without the rich losing in absolute terms
- As people's income rises, they are likely to pay more taxes
- Those extra tax revenues can be spent of program to alleviate poverty through subsidies
#### Greater ability to address environmental degradation
- Increases in government revenue that arises from economic growth provides government with the funds they need to fund measures for addressing pollution
- As more people become more affluent due to higher levels of income, they would become less focused on their own private consumption, and be more concerned about living in a clean environment
- Therefore, the regulation of pollution is tougher in developed countries than in developing countries
## Costs of economic growth
### Consumers
#### Lowering non-material standard of living
- Economic growth can come with longer working hours and higher stress levels within the population 
- Higher economic growth might be accompanied with a higher rate of environmental degradation
- This is because profit maximising firms tend to disregard the negative externalities of their production activities
#### Lowering current standard of living
- To achieve sustained economic growth, which requires potential growth, there will be a need for adequate investment such that there will be an expansion in the capital stock
- As investments are funded by savings, the opportunity cost of growth in a closed economy is lesser consumption in the current period
### Government
#### Rise in structural unemployment
- Structural unemployment happens when there is a mismatch in skills possessed by job-seekers and those demanded by firms
- It stems from structural changes and factor immobility
- Economic growth can involve changes in production, both in terms of the types of goods/ services produced and in terms of the techniques used and skills required
- The more rapid the rate of economic growth is, the more rapid structural change may occur
- If the skills and knowledge of the labour force does not improve as quickly as technological advancement, people may find that their skills are no longer relavant
- This is because their jobs are being replaced by machines or made redundant, resulting in structural unemployment
#### Worsening of the balance of trade
- A country's balance of trade is the export revenue earned minus the import expenditure
- When an economy grows, the rise in national income raises the purchasing power of consumers, and consumers will demand more goods, including imports
- Thus, import expenditure rises and the balance of trade worsens
#### Greater inequality in income distribution
- If the means to higher growth are in the form of greater incentives given to specific sectors of the economy, the people working in these sectors might get wealthier
- They will see a faster rise in disposable income or profits
- Without a corresponding transfer of income, there will be little to no benefits 'trickling down' to people who are not in these sectors, leading to income inequality
## Sustainable growth
- ==Sustainable economic growth refers to a rate of growth that is sustained without creating other significant socio-economic issues like environmental problems, especially for future generations==
### Why achieve sustainable growth?
- Not all natural resources are renewable, and exploitation of it could mean insufficient natural resources for future generations
- Destruction of the natural environment tends to occur alongside economic growth
- This is because profit maximising firms typically disregard external costs that arise from pollution created during production
- Rapid economic growth may read to depletion of clean water and air for residents in the country
- Thus governments should aim for slower economic growth that is sustainable rather than faster growth
- It can be measured using economic growth factors supplemented with indicators on natural usage and pollution
### Achieving sustainable growth
#### Improve factor productivity
- When growth is achieved mainly by discover and using more natural resources or through poulation growth, then certain natuarl resources will be depleted more rapidly
- This will cause the problem of exhausting natural resources to escalate
- Whereas if economic growth is driven by increased efficency in use of resources, then economic growth becomes more sustainable
#### Remove distortional subsidies for fossil fuels and encourage greater resources being allocated to cleaner alternatives/ green industries
- The rising prices of factors that are becoming increasingly scarce due to depletion will force firms to develop alternative methods of production that they can conserve on their use and develop alternative resources
- But, some government subsidise production of fossil fuels to spur economic growth and industrialisation, making economic growth less sustainable
- The subsidies lowered production cost and boosted industrialisation, but they also worsen air quality
- Firms also lack incentive to do R&D for alternative energies/ production methods
- Instead, government can ensure more resources get allocated into clean energy and green industries through subsidies or funding R&D
- This would lower costs but also reduce environmental impact of these industries
#### Government intervention to tackle degradation of the environment
- Free market forces are useful because factor price signals will guide firms to economise on the use of increasingly scarce resources
- But, the pursuit of profits in free markets in which firms disregard the external cost of of exhaustion of natural resources and degradation of the environment results in unsustainable growth
- Government policies like implementing measures to lower pollution would be more useful
## Inclusive growth
- ==Inclusive growth indicates a rate of growth that is sustained over a period, is broad based across economic sectors and creates productive employment opportunities for a majority of the population==
- It takes income distribution into consideration
### Why achieve inclusive growth?
#### Improved living standards for all
- A country could be growing over time, with the rich minority getting richer and the rest of the population experiencing a very limited rise in their real income or not at all
- The material standard of living of the majorities rises only marginally as compared to to rich due to the unequal distribution of the increase in national income
#### Reducing actual and potential growth over time
- Some income inequaity can lead to more growth
- This is because rising income inequality stems form profits rising at a much faster rate than wages
- This rise in profits is an incentive for entrepreneurs to innovate, driving economic growth
- Those with higher income also tent to save more, resulting in a higher level of investment for the economy
- But, in countries where consumption is the main driver of growth (e.g. US), greater concentration of income and wealth in the hands of the wealthy would slow down growth
- This is because they have a lower MPC (marginal propensity to consume), causing the size of the multiplier to be smaller
- This leads to a smaller multiplied rise in real GDP and hence a slowdown in actual growth when AD rises
- Moreover, when the lower income bracket workers are unable to or are slower to transit to the middle class
- Their spending power is capped or growing slowly, an they have more conservative expectations of income growth
- This would cause them to slow down consumption, and AD will shift slower to the right, resulting in slower economic growth
---
- Excessive income inequality can lead to political and social instability
- This would lead a lowered expected rate of returns on investment, leading to a fall in investment
- This slows down AD and lowers the rate of increase in AS
- Hence, actual and potential growth slows
---
- Rising and excessive income inequality can lead to lowered support for mainstream political parties in favour for populist politics
- This makes it harder form them to peruse necessary economic policies when needed if it involves short term pain
- This makes it harder for the government to attain its macroeconomic goals
### Achieving inclusive growth
#### Policies to redistribute income
- E.g. increase in corporate rate taxes, progressive income taxes, transfer payments
#### Policies to enhance equality of opportunity
- Inequality of opportunities undermines intergenerational social mobility and weakens incentive for the poor to invest in knowledge and engage in enterprise, which could enable them to benefit from economic growth
- Measures to increase equality of opportunity include equal access to high-quality education, skills upgrading and access to finance for entrepreneurship
