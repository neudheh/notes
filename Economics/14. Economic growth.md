- ==Actual economic growth is the increase in actual national output==
- National output is the equilibrium real national output
- A country's actual growth rate indicates whether the country's national output is rising or shrinking over time, and how rapidly national output is rising
- A country is in a technical recession if it experiences two consecutive quarters of negative actual growth
- ==Potential growth is the increase in the capacity of the economy to produce==
- It refers to an expansion in a country's potential national output (full employment national output)
## PPC
- When a country moves from a point inside the PPC to the point closer to or on the PPC, it is producing more of both goods and there has been actual economic growth
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the economy's productive capacity, and there has been potential economic growth
- When there are changes in quantity, quality of resources, or level of technology, there would be a shift of the PPC
## AD-AS model
- Since actual and potential growth are represented by changes in real and potential GDP, we will be using the AD-AS model
## Factors affecting actual growth
### Increase in aggregate demand
- The components of AD are planned consumption expenditure ($C$), investment expenditure ($I$), government expenditure ($G$), and net exports ($X-M$)
- If AD increases due to an increase in any of its components, equilibrium national output will increase, resulting in actual growth, assuming there is spare capacity
![[actual growth increase in AD.png]]
- The rise in AD creates shortages, causing an unplanned fall in inventories
- Firms would increase production and raise employment of factors of production
- Through the multiplier process, there will be a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
### Decrease in unit cost of production
- When there is a fall in the unit cost of production, AS rises and the horizontal AS will shift down, from $AS_0$ to $AS_1$
- Assuming AD remains constant, the rise in AS would lead to a rise in equilibrium real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, and there is actual growth
- This fall in horizontal AS could be due to falls in unit cost of production, or improvement in productivity of factors of production
![[actual growth fall in unit cost.png]]
- The rise in AS, as seen by the horizontal portion of AS shifting downwards, would lead to a fall in the general price level
- Through the wealth, international substitution, and interest rate effect, consumption ($C$), investment ($I$), and export expenditure ($X$) will rise, as seen by a movement along AD
- This movement in AD is from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, until equilibrium is restored at a higher equilibrium national output
## Factors affecting potential growth
- The rate of potential growth depends on supply side factors (factors that affect the capacity of the economy to produce)
- A country's potential or capacity can be increased in two ways, through increases in quantity of its factors of production (FOP), or increases of quality or productivity of FOP
- When a country has more factor inputs, its maximum possible output that it can produce increases
- The productivity of labor is the output per unit of the factor input
- When a country has the same quantity of factors of production, but each unit can produce more, the maximum possible output that the country can produced rises
- These would cause AS to increase, and vertical AS shifts right from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$, and potential national output to increase from $Yf_1$ to $Yf_2$, achieving potential growth
![[potential growth.png]]
## Factors affecting quantity of FOPs
### Capital
- A country's capital stock is its collection of durable assets (i.e. production plants, equipments) that is used for producing other goods and services
- With an increase in capital stock, it will be able to produce more goods and services, increasing the country's potential to produce
- A country's capital stock and increase through investment, and shrink through capital depreciation
- As long as net investment is positive (Net investment = Gross investment - Capital depreciation), capital stock will increase over time
- The level of investment consists of domestic and foreign investment
#### Domestic investment
- Domestic investment is investment by domestic firms
- It is affected by the level of saving the domestic interest rate, corporate tax rate, and the level of confidence about the future business and economic outlook
- Foreign investment is investment by foreign firms
- It is affected by the level of confidence about the future business and economic outlook, corporate tax rates, exchange rate stability, and ease of doing business
### Labor
- The average working hours per worker can increase, causing the economy to be able to produce more goods and services using the same number of workers
- The size of the labor force, which is the manpower currently available in the economy comprising of people who are working or seeking work, can change
#### Population size/ structure
- A change in population size can change the size of the labor force
- Changes in population size can occur due to changes in birth rates, death rates, or migration
- With a larger population size, the size of the labor force would also likely be larger
- A change in the population structure can also change the size of a country's labor force
- A country that is facing an ageing population would have fewer young workers joining the work force compared the the number of older workers that are retiring
- As a result, the size of the labor force decreases overall
#### Foreign labor inflows
- The inflow of foreign workers also increases the size of the labor force
- This inflow depends on the attractiveness of work in the host country (wage rates, crime rates) and government policy towards migrant labor (foreign worker levy and quota)
### Land
- A country's quantity of natural resources increases when there is discovery of new mineral deposits
- A country's natural resource can become depleted, when renewable resources are used at a faster rate than replacement (e.g. sea pollution, deforestation)
- It is hard to increase natural resources other than land reclamation
- But, the constraint that a fixed amount of land creates for potential growth can be overcome by optimising land use by building upwards, or building deeper
### Entrepreneurs
- Entrepreneurs bring different factors of production together to produce goods and services and bear the risk of making losses when undertaking production
- They also undertake investment in R&D which is needed for technological progress, impacting potential growth rate
- The lack of entrepreneurs is thus a constraint to potential growth
- The number of entrepreneurs can be affected by legal framework, funding, and a culture of risk taking and innovative/ creative thinking in the economy
## Factors affecting quality of FOPs
- Changes in the quality of the FOP affect the rate of potential growth
- The quality of a country's FOPs is the productivity of the FOPs
- There are two measures of factor productivity, labor productivity and total factor productivity
- Labor productivity is the measure of the amount of output obtained per unit of labor used in production
- Total factor productivity is the measure of the amount of output obtained from a given quantity of all the inputs used in production
### Physical capital
- Investment in physical capital increases the country's capital stock and the overall quantity of FOPs 
- E.g. Workers in a food-processing factory can produce more output per man hour if the firm invested in more food processors
- It also increases the productivity of land and labor, as with more capital, each unit of labor has more capital to work with, increasing productivity of labor
### Human capital
- Human capital is the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience
- Investment in human capital involves investing in education and skills training
- Higher quality of human capital raises a nation's ability to produce goods and services through greater knowledge and skills, increasing labor productivity
### Technology
 - Advancements in a country's level of technology in the form of process innovation will enable the same quantity of FOP to produce more in the same period
 - Technological progress can stem from R& conducted by private firms or the government, or transfer of knowledge from MNCs
 - The ability to a nation to effect and sustain technological change depends on 
	 - The quality and size of the nation's educational and training system
	 - The level of investment into R&D
	 - The existence of institutions that provide individuals with the ability and incentive to innovate and bring technological 
	 - E.g. financial system that enables individuals/ firms to raise funds for investment in R&D, and legal institutions that confer property right on to new inventions
## Government's role in stimulating potential growth
- Governments can use supply-side policies to stimulate potential growth
- They can subsidise education and job skills retraining to improve human capital
- A government's macroeconomic policies affect firms' investment plans and influence their long run expectations regarding the rate of return on their investments
- They do so by affecting the economic stability of their country
## Sustained growth
- ==Sustained economic growth is a situation where an economy's real national output increases over an extended period, without accelerating inflation rates==
- Without an expansion of potential national output, increase in equilibrium real national output must eventually come to an end
- This is become when there is full employment of labor and other FOPs, growth of equilibrium real national output will be restricted by growth of potential national output
- To sustain actual growth in the long run, potential output must continue to rise through a rise in vertical AS, together with a rise in actual output through a rise in AD
![[sustained economic growth.png]]
- Assume AD is at $AD_2$, and the economy is at equilibrium, where equilibrium real national output is at $Y_2$, and there is spare capacity in the economy
- An increase in AD from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$ will raise the equilibrium real national output from $Y_2$ to $Yf_0$
- This increase in real national output is known as actual growth
- For actual growth to be sustained in the long run, increases in AD alone are not enough, as increases in AD would only lead to further increases in general price level
- There needs to be increases in potential national output
- For real national output to increase beyond $Yf_0$, the rise in AD must be accompanied by an increase in AS, and there is expansion in the country's productive capacity
- The AS curve must shift to the right to $AS_1$, and this outward shift for the vertical portion of the AS indicates potential growth
- When this happens, the economy can now achieve an equilibrium real national output beyond $Yf_0$
- When AD increases to $AD_4$, together with a rise in potential national output, a new equilibrium is reached at point $c$ and actual growth happens again
### Long term growth rate
- Governments aim for sustained growth where real GDP rises over time, and the country's real GDP follows a rising long term trend path
- But, there may be a lack of growth in the long term due to sluggish AD and lack of increases in potential GDP
### Short term fluctuations
- Sometimes the economy may be in a boom, where the economic growth rates rises significantly, due to AD rising and there is sufficient capacity
- When AD rises faster then AS, the actual growth rate slows and inflation rate rises
- Other times, the economy may be in a bust or recession, when AD falls leading to negative growth and deflation, or AS falls leading to negative growth and inflation
## Benefits of economic growth
### Higher standards of living
- If actual economic growth exceeds population growth, it would lead to higher income per capita
- This can lead to higher levels of consumptions of goods and services, leading to a higher material standard of living
- Economic growth can also mean an increase in government tax revenue collected through corporate tax, personal income tax, and sales tax
- As the economy grows and income rises, the same direct tax rates will yield higher revenue for the government
- The rise in tax revenue enables governments to spend more on public goods, goods with positive externalities and public amenities, increasing material standard of living
- The government can also increase spending on cleaning up the environment, increasing the non-material standard of living of residents in the country
### Alleviate other macroeconomic problems
- Actual growth helps to reduce demand-deficient unemployment
- If economic growth is driven by a rise in AD, there will be a rise in real output, assuming there is spare capacity
- When output increases, demand-deficient unemployment will fall as firms hire more workers to increase output
- Potential growth is important for living standards to rise over time without compromising the macroeconomic of general price stability
- This is because as AD rises, the economy will eventually reach the full employment output
- Without a growth in productive capacity, further rises in AD will only cause demand-pull inflation
- This will reduce the purchasing power of citizens
### Redistributive benefits
- When real national output/ income is unchanged, a redistribution of income to improve equality would entail making one group better off while making another worse off
- When national incomes rise, by maintaining a constant tax rate, the government can distribute more income from the rich to the poor, without the rich losing in absolute terms
- As people's income rises, they will pay more taxes, and the extra revenue for the government can be spend on programs to alleviate poverty
- Without a continuing rise in national income, the scope for helping the poor is more limited
### Greater ability to address environmental problems
- Increases in government revenue that arises from economic growth provide governments with the funds that they need to fund measures for addressing pollution
- As people become more affluent due to higher levels of income, they can afford to be less preoccupied with their own private consumption, and be more concerned about living in a clean environment
- Hence, regulations of pollution are stricter in developed countries compared to developing countries
## Costs of economic growth
### Lowering of non-material standard of living
- Economic growth can come with longer working hours and higher stress levels
- There is increased levels of environmental degradation and increased levels of pollution because profit-maximising firms disregard the negative externalities of production
### Lowering of current material living standards
- To achieve sustained economic growth, there needs to be potential growth
- There is a need for adequate investment such that there will be an expansion in the country's capital stock
- Investments are funded by savings
- The opportunity cost of growth in a closed economy is lesser consumption in the current period
### Rise in structural employment
- Structural unemployment is when there is a mismatch in skills possessed by job-seekers and those demanded by firms
- It stems from structural changes and factor (labor) immobility
- Economic growth can involve changes in production, both in terms of the types of goods/ services produced, and the techniques and skills used
- The more rapid the rate of economic growth, the more rapid structural change may occur
- If the skills and knowledge of the labor force does not improve as quickly as technological advancements, people may find that their skills are no longer relevant
- This is because they are being replaced by machines or made redundant, causing structural unemployment
### Worsening in the balance of trade
- A country's balance of trade is the value of its exports of goods and services, minus the value of its imports of goods and services
- When an economy grows, the rise in national income causes a rise in spending in domestically produced goods and services
- But, it also increases spending on imports, which worsens the balance of trade
### Greater inequality in income distribution
- If the means to economic growth are in the form of greater incentives given to specific sectors to the economy, the people working in these sectors may get wealthier
- This is because they may see a faster rise in their disposable income or profits
- Without a corresponding transfer in income, there will be little to no benefits trickling down to people in these growth sectors, resulting in greater income inequality
## Sustainable growth
- ==Sustainable growth is a rate of growth that is sustained without creating other significant socio-economic issues==
- It can be measured by supplementing economic growth figures with indicators on pollution and natural resource usage
### Why achieve sustainable growth?
- Not all natural resources are renewable, and exploitation of it to bring about growth could mean insufficient natural resources for future generations to produce goods
- This could lead to a trade off between economic growth today and material standards of living in the future
- Destruction of the natural environment occurs alongside economic growth, as profit-maximising firms disregard external costs from pollution created during production
- The more rapid the economic growth, the more waste the environment must absorb, such as water and air pollution from production
- Rapid economic growth may thus lead to a depletion of clean water and breathable air for residents in the country, causing the future generation to see a fall in living standards
### Improve factor productivity
- When growth is achieved by discovering more natural resources or through population growth, then certain natural resources may get depleted more rapidly
- The problem of exhaustion of natural resources will escakate
- But, when economic growth is drive by increased efficiency in the use of resources, economic growth becomes more sustainable
### Remove distortionary subsidies for fossil fuels and encouraging greater resources being allocated to cleaner alternatives/ green industries
- The rising prices of factors that are becoming increasingly scarce will force firms to develop methods of production that can conserve on their use and develop alternate resources
- But, some governments subsidies production of fossil fuels to spur industrialisation and growth in the past, making economic growth less sustainable
- These lowered production costs and boosted industrialisation, but worsened air quality by encouraging firms to use 'dirty' sources of energy instead of clean energy
- Governments can instead intervene to ensure more resources get allocated into clean energy and green industries, through subsidies for solar and wind power/ electric cars
- They can also fun R&D for these sectors, lowering costs but also reducing environmental impacts of these industries
### Government intervention to tackle natural resource exhaustion or degradation of the environment
- Free market sources are useful because factor price signals will guide firms to reduce their use of increasingly scarce resources
- But, the pursuit of profits causes firms to disregard the external cost of exhaustion of natural resources for future generations and degradation of the environment
- As such, government policies such as measures that lower pollution like pollution taxes can lower the environmental impact of economic growth
## Inclusive growth
- ==Inclusive growth is a rate of growth that is sustained over a period, is broad-based across economic sectors, and creates productive employment opportunities for the majority of the country's population==
- Inclusive growth takes income distribution into consideration
- It can be measured by supplementing economic growth figures with the Gini Coefficient
### Why achieve inclusive growth?
#### Improved living standards for all
- A country can be growing over time with the rich minority getting richer and the rest of the population experiencing a very limited rise in their real income or not at all
- The material standard of living of the masses in various countries has risen only marginally as compared to the rich due to an unequal distribution of income
#### Reduced actual and potential growth
- Some inequality could lead to more growth, as income inequality stems from profits rising at a much faster rate than wages
- This rapid rise in profits is an incentive for entrepreneurs to innovate, spurring economic growth
- Those with higher income have a higher propensity to save, resulting in a higher level of investment for the economy
- But, excessive income inequality is bad for growth
- In countries where consumption is the main driver of growth like the US, a greater concentration of income in the wealthiest could slow down actual growth
	- The marginal propensity to consume is lower for higher income earners and wealthier households
	- The size of the multiplier will be smaller, leading to a smaller rise in real GDP, and a slowdown in economic growth when AD rises
	- When lower-income bracket workers are unable or slower to transit to the middle class, their spending power is capped or growing slowly
	- With a conservative expectation of their income growth, the growth in consumption slows and there is a slower shift in AD to the right, resulting in slower actual growth
- Excessive income inequality can lead to political and social instability, leading to a lowered expected rate of returns on investments, leading to a fall in investment
	- This dampens expansion in AD and lowers the rate of increase in AD, causing actual and potential growth to slow
- Rising and excessive income inequality can lead to lower support for mainstream political parties in favour for populist politics
	- This makes it difficult for the government to pursue necessary economic policies when needed if it involves short-term pain (e.g. wage cuts)
	- This makes it difficult for the government to attain is macroeconomic goals
### Policies to redistribute income
- Increase corporate taxes, higher personal income taxes for the highest income groups, more transfer payments for the poor
### Policies to enhance equality of opportunity
- Inequality of opportunities undermines intergenerational social mobility and weakens incentives for the poor to invest in knowledge and engage in enterprise
- They thus cannot benefit from economic growth
- E.g. Equal access to high-quality education, skills upgrading, access to finance for entrepreneurship
