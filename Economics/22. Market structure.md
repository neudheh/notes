## Market power
- ==Market power refers to a firm's ability to influence the price of the good it sells==
- Market power can be measured by market share and market concentration ration
- A firms market power is dependent on the availability of closeness of substitutes for consumers, which is dependent of the number of firms or competitors in the market
- The bigger the firms market share, the greater its market power $$Market\ Share = \frac{Firm's\ output\ value}{Total\ output\ value\ of\ the\ industry} \times 100\%$$
- The market concentration ratio is the percentage of the total market of the largest few firms in the industry
### Degree of product differentiation
- The higher the degree of product differentiation by a firm, the lower the substitutability of the product and so the greater the firm's market power
- In perfect competition, where all firms produce a homogenous product such that each firms product is a perfect substitute of another, each firm has no market power
- In the real world, there will be some degree of differentiation in the output of firms in the same market
- Consumers will perceive the products of competitors to be imperfect substitutes
- Hence, when a firm raises the prices, it will be able to retain some customers
- Products can have real differences, which are created through the quality of their customer service, location, or product attributes, packaging
- It can also have imaginary differences which are created through persuasive advertising
### Level of barriers to entry
- The higher the entry barriers, the lower the degree of competition, the greater the market power of firms in the market
- A barrier to entry is any obstacle or restriction faced by potential competitors which deters or restricts them from entering a market to compete with incumbent firms
- Entry barriers are the key sources of market power because their level determines the degree of competition and hence the number of substitutes available
- Thus, it also determines the extent quantity demanded falls due to a rise in price
- The fewer the number of firms in the market, the fewer the number of substitutes that consumers can turn to when a firm raises the prices of its goods
- These barriers can be natural or artificial
#### Natural barriers
**Financial barriers**
- Some businesses require huge initial capital expenditure and returns are uncertain 
- These factors deter the entry of new firms who are unable (due to the high capital expenditure) or unwilling (due to the high risk) to finance such investments
- In some cases, the government may first undertake to finance them, and then privatize them at a later stage
**Economies of scale**
- EOS refers to decreases in unit cost when the scale of production is increased
- When the production process allows substantial internal EOS to be reaped, the incumbent firms can grow to a large size
- Their low unit cost will pose as an entry barrier into the market
- This is because new firms with a small market share will not have a large enough scale of production for their unit cost to be low enough to compete and survive
- As the financial resources needed and risk involved in entering such markets are enormous, new firms are deterred from entering
**Natural monopoly**
- In some industries, the EOS are so substantial relative to market demand, the industry cannot support more than one producer
- The huge set-up costs in the investment in infrastructure allows for substantial EOS to be reaped, resulting in a very large minimum efficient scale
- One firm can supply the market demand at a lower average cost than two or more firms can
- This is known as a natural monopoly
- E.g. telecommunications need to lay cables, incurring high fixed costs, but once it is in place, the variable costs in distributing these goods are minimal
![[natural monopoly.png]]
- The AC and MC curves are falling throughout the range of the demand as it can continue to lower its costs as output increases due to substantial economies of scale
- The EOS are so large only one firm can survive
- If there were 2 firms and each firm's share of the market was halved, the demand curve would be $D_{1/2}$ 
- But, there would be no output level that each firm can produce profitability as AC is higher than the highest price that can be charged ($D_{1/2}$  is always below $AC$)
- If there was only 1 firm, there is a range of output that can be produced profitably ($Q_1 - Q_2$)
**Transportation costs**
- The geographical distance keep markets in different locations separated from each other, limiting the extent of competition in each market
- E.g. inaccessibility in remote villages result in high transportation costs, eliminating the potential for outside suppliers to be profitable, preventing them from entering the market
- As such, the local grocery store can enjoy monopoly power, and are known to be a localized monopoly
**Control/ ownership of raw materials**
- A firm may have market power through the control of key resources, and as a result there is little to no competition
- E.g. De Beers owns 90% of the world's supply of diamonds
#### Artificial barriers
**Patents**
- To promote more inventions, governments may issue patents
- A patent grants an inventor the exclusive rights to produce/ sell the product or use the production process that is patented for a limited period
- The aim is to promote original research and development of new ideas and advancement, and let the inventor at least recoup the costs of R&D
- But, competition is limited as new firms who do not have the right to use the knowledge needed for producing the good will be unable to enter the market
**Copyright**
- Copyright is property rights granted on plays, textbooks, novels, songs, software for a period
- It gives the copyright holder the right to determine who may adapt the work to other forms, perform the work or financially benefit from the work
**Licenses**
- The government may award a single firm the exclusive right to supply a particular good or service
- The aim may be to control congestion of infrastructure, synchronize output to create better service, avoid duplication of effort and limit the overconsumption of demerit goods
**Trade barriers**
- Trade barriers are attempts by the government via protectionist measures to prevent potential foreign competitors from competing in the domestic market
- This protects local firms from foreign competition, and local workers from unemployment
- But, this increases the domestic firm's market power in the home market since foreign competition is reduced
**Strategic entry deterrence**
- When natural barriers are low, incumbent firms might to try to design some strategic barriers of their own to discourage potential entrants from entering and competing
- They may do so even if it not profit-maximizing to do so currently
## Types of market structures
- Market structure is the characteristic of a market which determines the behavior of the firms as well as their performance
- Classified by
	- Levels of barriers to entry and exit
	- Number and size of sellers
	- Nature of product
	- Level of market information/ knowledge
### Perfect competition
- Market structure where there are many firms, freedom of entry and exit in the industry, and all firms produce a homogenous product, and there is perfect knowledge of the good by both consumers and producers, and all firms are price takers
- **No barriers to entry or exit** - no obstacles to prevent new firms from entering or existing firms from leaving
- **Many sellers** - Many sellers, and each seller's output is insignificant relative to the total market supply, causing each firm to have a very small market share
- **Homogenous product** - There are no differences real or imaginary between the product of one firm and that of other firms; they are identical and perfect substitutes
- **Perfect market information** 
	- Consumers have perfect information on prices and they will not buy at higher prices when lower prices are available, ensuring price uniformity
	- Consumers have perfect knowledge of the types and quality of product available, thus advertising will not work to differentiate products
	- Producers have perfect knowledge of factor/ input prices and the latest technology, and are able to choose the productively efficient method of production, minimizing cost
	- Producers are aware of the type of profit made by every producer in the industry, and new firms will enter when existing firms are making supernormal profits
### Monopolistic competition
- Market structure where they are many firms and ease of entry and exist in the industry, but each firm produces a differentiated product and has some control over prices
- **Low barriers to entry and exit** - limited obstacles to prevent new firms from entering the industry or preventing existing firms from leaving
- **Many buyers/ sellers** - Many sellers, and each seller only produces a small proportion of the total market output
	- No mutual independence between firms, with each firm deciding its price-output policy without considering the possible reactions of other firms
	- This is because each firms actions will not have significant impact on the market
	- Firms are competitors, but not rivals
- **Product differentiation** - each firms product is similar but not identical, only slightly different
### Oligopoly
- Market structure where there are a few dominant firms which control a major share of the market, and there are barriers that prevent the entry of new firms. The firms are mutually interdependent and are rivals
- **High barriers to entry and exit** - Barriers to entry are lower than a monopoly, but high enough such that entry is limited and restricted to a few sellers
- **A few dominant firms which are rivals** - Few firms are dominating and leading the industry, but thousands in the industry
	- It is considered a few if each seller takes the actions and reactions of their rival's strategies into account when making their own production and marketing decisions
	- This is known as mutual interdependence
	- They are price setters
- **Homogenous or differentiated products**
### Monopoly
- Market structure where a single firm controls most/ all of the entire market share of the good or service
- **High barriers to entry or exit** - The barriers are so high that it is impossible for a new firm to enter
- **One seller dominates the market**
- **The product does not have any close substitutes**
## Relationship between market structure and market power
- The higher the entry barriers, the lower the level of competition, and the greater the market power of firms
### Perfectly competitive markets
- Each firms is a price taker by charging the marker equilibrium price where the market demand and supply curves intersect
- Each firm will not charge a price lower than the prevailing market price, as it is not rational because it can sell as many units as it wants at the market price
- Each firm will not charge a price higher than the prevailing market price becuase it would lose all of its customers to other firms selling at market price 
- This is because they are selling an identical product, and the demand for each firms product is perfectly price elastic
- There will be price uniformity throughout the entire market
### Imperfectly competitive markets
- Firms posses market power, and can be price setters
- In a MC market, each firm can rise prices without losing all its sales as some customers are willing to pay a higher price for the differentiated product
- For oligopolies, the differentiated product and high barriers to entry allow them to be price setters, as each firm has limited competition
	- They can rise prices without facing significant loss in sales due to the availability of few substitutes
- For monopolies, the high barriers of ensure lead to absence of competition, and when prices are raised, it would not lose much sales due to the lack of substitutes
- Thus, a firm in an imperfectly competitive market faces a downward sloping demand curve
- A firm with greater market power will have a more price inelastic demand curve
- The demand for the product of a monopolist will be more price inelastic than the demand for the product of a monopolistic competitive firm
- This is becuase there are no substitutes for the monopolists product, while there are many substitutes for a monopolistic competitive firm's product
## Output decision
- Firms aim to maximize profits $$Total\ profit = TR - TC = TR - (Explicit\ costs + Implicit\ costs)$$
- The profit maximizing level is when marginal revenue = marginal cost, where MR is cutting MC from below
- When MR > MC, an additional or marginal unit of output produced adds more to the firm's TR than to its TC, causing total profits to rise
	- This implies that the firm's current output level does not yield the highest level of total profit yet
- When MR < MC, an additional unit of output adds lesser to the firms TR than to TC, and the firm incurs a loss on the marginal unit produced
	- The firm should decrease output to the level where MR = MC
- At MR = MC, the firm is in equilibrium, there is no tendency for it to want to change its output further as profits are already maximized
## Pricing decision
- Imperfectly competitive firms have the power to affect the price of the product it sells
- It will want to fully exploit its market power by charging the highest price consumers are willing and able to pay
- This is assuming there is no rival consciousness, firms are not regulated by the government, and firms have knowledge of their revenue and costs
- They will charge the price given by the demand curve at the profit maximizing output
## Types of profits in the short run
- When P > ATC or TR > TC, the firms is earning supernormal profits
![[supernormal profits.png]]
- When P = ATC or TR = TC, the firm is earning normal profits
![[normal profits.png]]
- When P < ATC or TR < TC, the firm is earning subnormal profits
![[subnormal profits.png]]
## Shut-down decision
- A shut down refers to a short run decision not to produce anything during a specific period because of current market conditions
- ==In the short run, a firm should shut down if and only if TR is not able to cover all variable costs, where TR < TVC or P < AVC==
- In the short run, there are fixed and variable costs of production
- By shutting down it only incurs the fixed costs, as it is still in the industry
- By continuing production, it incurs both fixed and variable costs
## Long-run exit decision
- Exit is a long run decision to leave the market, and exit the industry
- In the long-run, all costs are favorable and it is only rational for firms to remain in operation if they can cover all costs
- Firms should be earning at least normal profits, and if they are earning subnormal profits they should leave
- This is becuase enough time has passed for firms to adjust the size of their plants, and choose the industry it operates in
## Types of profits in the long run
### Perfect competition
- In the long run, all firms will be making only normal profits
- If existing firms are making supernormal profits, new firms will enter the industry, causing market supply to rise and result in downward pressure on price
- This erodes the supernormal profits, and long-run equilibrium is reached when supernormal profits are completely eroded and all firms are earning only normal profits
- If existing firms are earning subnormal profits, some firms will exit the industry, causing market supply to fall and price to increase
- This erodes the subnormal profits, and long-run equilibrium is reached when the subnormal profits are completely eroded, until all firms are only making normal profits
### Monopolistic competition
- Monopolistic competitive firms can only make normal profits in the long run due to the ease of entry and exit
- If firms are making supernormal profits, new firms will enter the industry, causing demand for the existing firms product to fall and become more price elastic
- This erodes the supernormal profits, and long-run equilibrium is reached when the subnormal profits are completely eroded, until all firms are only making normal profits
- If firms are making subnormal profits, firms will exit the industry, causing demand for other firm's product to rise and become less price elastic
- This erodes the subnormal profits, and long-run equilibrium is reached when the subnormal profits are completely eroded, until all firms are only making normal profits
### Oligopoly and monopoly
- In a long run, it is possible for a monopolist or oligopolist to enjoy supernormal profits becuase new firm cannot enter the industry due to high barriers of entry
>[!EXAMPLE]
>Changes in demand affecting profits of an MC firm
>![[changes in demand affecting profits of an MC firm.png]]
>- Initial position
>	- The restaurant that serves Korean meals using using a plant (restaurant) whose cost curves are represented by $MC$ and $ATC$
>	- The demand curve is $D$ and the marginal revenue curve is $MR$
>	- Profit maximizing level of output is $Q$, where MR = MC
>	- The firms charges the price $P$ based on the level of demand
>	- The price = ATC and the firm only earns normal profits
>- Introduce the change
>	- A growing interest in Korean culture has led to the rise in demand for Korean meals, causing demand to rise to $D'$ and MR rise to $MR'$
>- Response in the short run
>	- This firm will increase output to $Q'$ as for each unit in $Q' - Q$, MR > MC and total profits could be increased by increasing output
>	- The firm raises its price to $P'$ as this is the highest price that consumers are now willing to able to pay at $Q'$ units
>	- At the new output level, supernormal profits of area $P'BCX$ are made
>- Response in the long run
>	- The new supernormal profits attract new firms into the industry in the long run
>	- New firms are able to enter due to the very low entry barriers into the industry
>	- As new firms enter, the existing firm will have more competitors and hence its market share decreases
>	- The fall in demand is represented by a leftward shift of the demand curve for its product
>	- There are more substitutes available, and demand becomes more price elastic
>	- This process continues until demand curve $D$ is tangent to the ATC curve at point $A$
>	- At this point, the firm maximizes profit by producing at $Q$ where MR = MC and the price $P$ is enough to cover average costs
>	- It is back to earning normal profits
## Allocative efficiency
### Perfect competition
- Assuming the absence of externalities and the good is a private good, perfect competition ensures allocative efficiency
- When firms have no market power, and externalities are absent, the pursuit of profit maximization leads to allocative efficiency
- Firms are price takers, and each firm takes the market price, which is the MR of selling and additional unit, and is willing and able to sell units of output up to where MC=MR=P
- The market equilibrium quantity will be allocative efficient, because at equilibrium, the market demand and supply curves intersect at the price and quantity where P = MC
- The price/ marginal benefit of the final unit purchased is equal to the marginal cost of the resources used to produce that unit
- There is no way to relocate resources to increase the net total benefit to society, and there is neither over nor under production
- The market equilibrium quantity is socially optimal and society's welfare is maximized
### Imperfect competition
![[allocative inefficency firms.png]]
- When a firm has market power, its output/ price decision leads to allocative inefficiency
- Due to market power, the demand curve is downward sloping, where MR is below the demand curve
- In pursuit of profits, the firm will produce where MR = MC
- The firm will exploit market power by charging a price of $P_M$, but at this profit maximizing output, P > MC
- Hence the price charged is higher than the MC of production
- For units $Q_M$ to $Q*$, P > MC, meaning that the price consumers are willing to pay exceeds the additional cost incurred by society in producing it
- The is an underproduction of goods
- Additional benefit to society of producing $Q* - Q_M$ units - area $Q_MabQ*$
- Additional cost incurred by society of producing $Q* - Q_M$ units - area $Q_McbQ*$
- Deadweight loss of producing $Q_M$ units - Area $abc$
- Once a single profit-maximizing firm has market power, there will be market failure
- But this is less severe in MC than in monopoly or oligopoly, as demand for an MC firm is more price elastic due to there being many firms in the industry
- It will be less able to charge a high price, hence the level of underproduction and deadweight loss is small
## Productive efficiency
- ==Productive efficiency is when firms are producing output at the lowest possible unit cost==
- When firms are profit-maximizers, they will be cost-minimizers and therefore are productively efficient
- Thus, profit maximizing perfectly competitive firms and imperfectly competitive firms are productively efficient
- The unit cost or average cost incurred is the lowest possible for the firms chosen level of output
- All point on the LRAC curve are productively efficient
- But, monopolies with high market power, due to the lack of competition may be complacent and be X-inefficient, and may not produce at the lowest possible output
- An X-inefficient firm incurs unit costs that are higher than its lowest possible unit cost for any given output level
- Unit cost is higher than what the LRAC could have been, making it productively inefficient
- This problem may apply to oligopolies if there is collusion too
- Perfectly competitive firms and MC firms have high incentive to be productive efficient as they face high competition
