## Scarcity
- All societies face the central economic problem of ==scarcity, where there are unlimited wants, and limited resources relative to unlimited wants==
- A resources is scarce if demand at a price of zero exceeds the available supply
- Practically all resources are scarce
## Factors of production
- Factors of production are resources that a society uses from producing goods and services
### Land
- Land refers to all the natural resources used or are available for production of goods and services
- Land for factories, natural resources (water, wood, metals, fossil fuels ores)
- The amount of natural resources that a country can have is limited by its geographical size and ability to access it 
- Land is exchanged for rent
- Renew natural resources (e.g. water, wind) renew themselves at a fast enough pace for sustainable economic extraction, while non-renewable natural resources do not (e.g. oil, ores)
### Labour
- Labour refers to the physical and mental effort of people used or are available for production of goods and services
- The human effort must be willing and able to work
- Can be low or high skill
- Affected by the population in the working age groups and migration policies
- Labour is exchanged for wage
### Capital
- Capital refers to all the man-made physical assets used or are available for the production of other goods and services
- Fixed capital is durable and is used time and time again in the production process (factory buildings, stadiums, school buildings, machinery, equipment)
- Circulating capital (inventory) refer to items such as raw materials, semi-finished goods and stocks of goods waiting to be sold
- A raw material is land if it is still not extracted and processed
- Once raw material is extracted and processed, it is capital
- Stocks, bounds, money are used to purchase capital, but it is not capital itself as it does not produce anything
- Capital is exchanged for interest
### Entrepreneur
- Entrepreneurs undertake the risk of production, which are the uninsurable risks of earning losses as a result of undertaking production
- They organise production, by combining other factors of production to produce a good or service
- They innovate, developing new products and methods of production
- They take overall responsibility for the decision making process of the firm, such as deciding on what and how much to produce, how the product will be marketed, etc
- Entrepreneur is exchanged for profits
## Choice
- Scarcity necessitates choice
- ==Choice is deciding how to allocate limited resources among competing uses for the satisfaction of human wants==
- Consumers, firms and governments have to make choices
- Consumers have limited income and have to decide on what to buy since they can't buy everything they want
- Firms can afford to only pay for a limited amount of resources and have to decided on what to produce and what resources to hire
- Government have limited budget and have to decided how to allocate its spending
## Opportunity cost
- When a choice is made, opportunity cost is incurred
- Each time a scarce resource is used to satisfy a want, an alternative want is sacrificed
- ==Opportunity cost is the cost of suing resources for a certain activity, measured in terms of the net benefit that could be derived from the next best alternative foregone==
- It includes any money not spent on the current options as it is the net benefit (Benefit - cost)
>[!NOTE] Example
> A certain amount of resources can be used by a firm to produce
> 1. Residential accommodation that can yield $2m in profits
> 2. Pharmaceutical drugs that can yield $4m in profits
> 3. Pineapples that can yield $0.25m in profits
> - The opportunity cost of using the resources to produce the pharmaceutical drugs is the sacrifice of the net benefit from building housing since this is the next best alternative
## Decision making process
![[decision making.jpg]]
- There are 3 key economic agents: consumers, producers and governments
- They must interact each other at the national and international levels
- Due to the fundamental problem of scarcity, each agent has to make decisions (choices)
- They have to take into account various **considerations**, recognise the **constraints** they are operating within, consider the **costs** and **benefits** as well as **information** and **perspectives** to weigh the costs and benefits
- The decision can have bot intended and unintended consequences
- When changes in the environment occur, economic agents may have to go through the decision making process again
- Decision make by economic agents are in fact decisions on how to allocate resources
### Objectives of each agents
- The choices made by consumers, producers and the government are based on their goals
- Economists assume that rational economic agents aim to maximise their self-interest
- Consumers aim to maximise their net total utility (satisfaction form buying goods)$$Net\ Total\ Utility = Total\ utility\ from\ good/service- Total\ spending\ on\ good/service$$
- Firms aim to maximise their profits from producing and selling goods and services$$Profits = Total\ revenue\ from\ selling\ good/service\ -Total\ cost\ of\ producing\ the\ good/service$$
- Governments aim to maximise social welfare when making policy decisions
$$Net\ total\ social\ welfare = Total\ social\ benefits - Total\ social\ cost$$
### Constraints
- In achieving their objectives, economic agents must be aware of the constraints that they are operating within as this will determine the choices available to them
- Economic agents will then decided on the best-ranked choice that enables them to maximise their self-interest
- Consumers have limited income
- Firms have limited financial resources
- Governments have limited tax revenue collected
- Economic agents face budget constraints
- Governments also face the constraint of the social and pollical acceptability of their chosen mode of intervention
### Costs and benefits (Marginalist principle)
- In making any decision, every economic agent would have to consider the monetary and non-monetary costs and benefits of every possible choice
- The marginalist principle is a simple decision making rule that helps economic agents to make decisions
- ==It involves weighing marginal costs and benefits to decided if they should continue or stop the current or existing activity==
- Marginal benefit is the additional benefit of doing one more unit of activity
- Marginal cost is the addition cost of doing one more unit of activity
- The marginalist principle states that if the marginal benefit is greater than the marginal cost, it is rational to do more of an activity since the additional to total benefit exceeds the addition to total cost, meaning that net total benefit is rising
- If the marginal benefit is lesser than the marginal cost, it is rational to do lesser of the activity since the addition to total benefit is lesser than the addition to total cost, meaning that net total benefit is falling
- The optimal level of doing an activity is attained when marginal benefit is equal to marginal cost
### Information
- In order to make sound decisions, economic agents first have to gather accurate information, both qualitative and quantitative, on the costs of benefits of every available choice
- Consumers buying decisions are aimed at maximising net total utility, and will consider information that helps them to weigh private benefits and costs of different goods/ services
- E.g. Benefits from different goods/ services that accrue to the buyer of the good -> features of different goods/ services, prices of different goods and services
- Firms production and selling decisions are aimed at maximising total benefits, and will obtain information that aids them to weigh private benefits and costs
- E.g. Market research to find out the tastes of consumers, the costs of inputs, whether purchased or provided by the entrepreneur, to produce the goods/ services
- The government seeks to maximise society's welfare (net total social benefit), and will consider information to weigh social benefits and costs
- E.g. Benefits that accrue to consumers (income that they are likely to earn as a result of receiving education), and benefits that accrue to third parties who benefit from those who consume education (a more civil society), the cost of production (cost of land, building materials, teachers' salaries) and cost borne by third parties (noise pollution from building the school)
### Perspectives
- Economic agents do not make decisions in isolation of other, since the impact on and subsequent reaction of those affected by the decision may in turn affect the intended outcome of the decision make
- Producers need to consider the perspectives of consumers in analysing the effectiveness of marketing strategies employed
- Governments consider the perspective of stakeholders in policy decisions
### Consequences
- Economic decisions are often made to tackle of mitigate economic problems, and the impact of such decision can be analysed in terms of intended and unintended consequences
- Decisions are made with the expectation that the decision will achieve its intended outcome and resolve the economic problem
- The outcome is an intended consequence
- Unintended consequences are outcomes that are not intended in the economic decisions
- Decision made by economic agent can have multifaceted implications
- The decision made by consumers of firms may not just impact the decision maker, but other economic agents too
- The decisions made by economic agents at the national level can have an impact at the international level
- Unintended consequences may occur because economic agents may not have made their decisions under perfect information, due to an inability to have access to complete information or consider all perspectives
- Conditions in the internal and external environment are subject to constant and unpredictable change, causing the decision making process to be less then optimal
- When unintended consequences occur, the economic decision-making process becomes more complex
- Economic decision may have to be reviewed and/ or measures to manage the adverse impact of these consequences may have to be introduced
- This would entail taking into account additional and/or new information considering the benefits and costs of decision made
## Production-possibilities curve
- ==A production-possibilities curve (PPC) shows the combinations of the maximum amount of two goods and economy can produce within a certain period (usually a year), with a fixed level of technology and when all available resources are fully and efficiently employed==
### Assumptions
- A specific perido (e.g. 1 year)
- State of technology unchanged
- Total available resources remain the same
- Efficient use of all resources - all resources are fully employed and the latest technology is used
![[PPC.jpg]]
### Micro economic concepts
#### Scarcity
- Combinations beyond the PPC are desired due to unlimited wants, but are not attainable due to limited resources
- Combinations on and inside the PPC are attainable
#### Choice
- The economy must decide on which attainable combination to produce
- In doing so, it decides on what the produce and how much to produce
- The chosen output combination is dependent on society's preferences
#### Trade-offs and opportunity cost
- The downwards sloping nature of the PPC illustrates trade-offs
- When one country produces more units of one type of good, it has to sacrifice some units of the other goods
- This is because when a country is already on the PPC, it is already fully utilising all available resources and the current technology available
- Assuming there are only 2 alternative uses of the resource, (i.e. capital or consumer good), producing more consumer goods will incur a opportunity cost of the net benefit forgone from the next best alternative, which is producing more capital goods
### Productive efficiency
- ==Productive efficiency is a situation in which the economy cannot produce any more of one good without sacrificing the production of another good==
- When a country is producing a combination on the PPC, it is producing the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
- It must sacrifice one good to obtain more units of another, and is in a state of productive efficiency
- In contrast, if a country is producing inside the PPC, there is a wastage of resources
- The country is in a state of productive inefficiency due to underemployment or unemployment
- Underemployment is when there is inefficient use of resources (resources are engaged in production, but are operating below potential)
- Unemployment is when there is failure to use all resources (some resources are not used at all for production)
### Shifting
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the productive capacity of the economy (maximum possible output that can be produced by the economy)
- The PPC shifts outwards when there is an increase in the quantity of available resources
	- Land - Discovery of new mining grounds, fishing grounds
	- Labour - Population growth, inflow of foreign workers
	- Capital - Increased investment in factories, machinery, infrastructure like transport and telecommunication networks
	- Entrepreneurs - Rise in the number of entrepreneurs
- The PPC also shifts outward when there is an improvement in the quality of the available resources
- The productivity of the factor input is the output per unit factor input
- If the quantity of resources is the same, but each unit of resources has become more productive, the country's ability to produce expands, causing an outward shift of the PPC
	- Land productivity can be improved through improved techniques of production (irrigation systems, fertilisers, extraction)
	- Capital productivity can be improved by advancements in technology (improved machinery as a result of R&D)
	- Labour productivity can be improved through increasing the education and/or skills level of the workforce by investing in human capital (more educated/ skilled labour is more able to make use of the latest machinery or method of production, improving productivity)
### Capital and consumer goods
- Capital goods are man-made goods which are used to produce other goods, and are not meant for immediate consumption
- Consumer goods are for final consumption, ready for use as they are
### Consequences of the investment-consumption choice
- Investment is the production of capital goods in a certain time period
- The more investment a country undertakes, the more capital goods it produces, the greater the productive capacity of the country in the following time periods, as capital goods are used to produce other goods
- If a country chooses to produce more capital rather than consumer goods, it will be able to produce more capital and consumer goods in the future, reflected by an outward shift in the PPC in the futrue
- But, consumer goods are sacrificed, and lesser needs and wants are satisfied in the current period
- An opportunity cost is incurred in the form of net benefit from the consumer goods sacrificed
- ==Ceteris paribus, the higher the level of investment, the greater the rate of economic growth, and the greater the expansion in productive capacity of the economy (i.e. outward shift in the PPC over time)==
- ==Capital consumption refers to the reduction in value of capital goods over a one year period due to physical wear and tear, and also due to capital becoming obsolete==
- For there to be an increase in the total quantity of capital goods in the economy, the rate of production of capital goods must be greater than the rate of capital consumption
- If the rate of capital production is lesser than the rate of capital consumption, the rate of economic growth decreases, and the productive capacity of the economy might decrease, causing the PPC to shift inwards
### Efficiency
- Productive efficiency is when the economy can no longer produce any more of one good without sacrificing production of another good
- The economy is producing the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
- All firms are producing at the lowest possible average cost, and all resources are fully employed
- All points on the PPC are productive efficient points
- ==Allocative efficiency is when the economy is producing the combination of output most desired/ wanted by society, and society's welfare is maximised==
- The economy has to already be producing on the PPC, at the point on the PPC which maximises society's welfare in accordance with society's preferences
- Allocative efficiency is attained when every good or service is produced up to the point where the last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers that is equal to the marginal cost of production
- Productive efficiency needs to be already achieved to achieve allocative efficiency
- When productive efficiency is achieved, it does not necessarily mean that there is allocative efficiency, because the output may not be what people want
- Only one point on the PPC is allocative efficient
### Equity
- Another criterion for assessing the best use of resources is equity in distribution of output
- Equity is achieved when output is distributed in a way that is fair or just
- What is considered fair is based on society's value judgement
- The current output may be deemed allocative efficient, but could be inequitable or unfair as some people are extremely rich, while some are extremely poor
- How we decide what society want is through those who are willing and can pay for what they want (i.e. the rich)
- Income inequality, which leads to inequitable output distribution, cannot be neglected
- If not alleviated, it can be a source of social discontent, which can spell distruction for the economy
