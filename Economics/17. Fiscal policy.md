## Government budget
- Government budget = Tax revenue - Government spending
- Government spending is made up of government expenditure and transfer payments
- Government expenditure is direct expenditure by the government on goods and services, and it contributes towards AD and is included in GDP
- Transfer payments are funds paid to individuals by the government for which it receives no goods and services in return (e.g. unemployment benefits)
- Transfer payments indirectly increase AD when households spend these payments on final goods and services, increasing C
- Government tax revenue comes from direct and indirect taxes
### Budget deficit
- When a government runs a budget deficit, it can be financed by using past accumulated reserves
- In the future, the government will has less reserves to spend, or tax revenue will have to be diverted to pay for the resulting debt and the interest incurred
- There will be less financial resources in the future for the government so spend on social and developmental needs
- There is an intergenerational transfer of welfare from future generations to current ones
- Excessive fiscal debt may result in the government's creditors becoming fearful that the government will default on its debt, triggering capital flight
- This can create severe macroeconomic instability, thus the government may need to undertake painful austerity measures that have a contractionary effect on the economy
## Expansionary fiscal policy
- An expansionary fiscal policy involves reducing direct taxes, or increasing government spending
- These can be used to address the problems of negative actual growth, and demand-deficient unemployment, or demand-side deflation
- A government can increase the government expenditure (G) component of AD by building infrastructure such as roads or expansion of railways lines
- A government can increase consumption expenditure (C) of AD by giving more transfer payments
- This increases consumer's disposable income and purchasing power, and they will increase their demand for goods and services
- A government can increase consumption expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I) of AD by cutting direct taxes
- Lower taxes increases consumer's disposable income and purchasing power, and they will increase their demand for goods and services
- Lower corporate tax will increase the post-tax rate of returns of investment, and firms will increase investment 
- This is because the marginal benefit of investment is more than the marginal cost, causing some previously unprofitable units of investment to be profitable

- An expansionary fiscal policy will increase AD and lead to a rightward shift in AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ as G, C, and I increase
- Firms will see an unplanned fall in inventories, and will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- Household's income will increase, and they will spend a portion of it domestic goods and services, leading to a rise in induced consumption
- This causes AD to shift from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- This leads to another unplanned fall in inventories, and further increases in production and more FOPs being hired, resulting in another cycle of spending
- There would be a multiplied increased in real GDP to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier effect
- There is actual economic growth as illustrated by a rise in real GDP form $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- There is also a fall in demand deficient unemployment as derived demand for labor increases as firms increase output
## Contractionary fiscal policy
- A contractionary fiscal policy involves raising direct taxes, or decreasing government spending
- This is to tackle demand-pull inflation
- The government can decrease the government expenditure (G) of AD by building lesser infrastructure
- The government can decrease consumption expenditure (C) by giving lesser transfer payments
- This decreases consumer's disposable income and purchasing power, and they will decrease their demand for goods and services
- The government can decrease consumer expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I) by raising direct taxes
- Higher taxes decreases consumer's disposable income and purchasing power, and they will decrease their demand for goods and services
- Higher corporate tax will increase the post-tax rate of returns of investment, and firms will decrease investment 
- This is because the marginal benefit of investment is cost than the marginal cost, causing some previously profitable units of investment to be unprofitable

![[demand side deflation.png]]
- This would decrease AD, causing it it to shift to the left from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- There would be an unplanned rise in inventories, and decrease production by hiring lesser FOPs
- Households income will decrease, and they will spend lesser of it on domestic goods and services, decreasing induced consumption
- This causes AD to shift from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- This leads to another unplanned rise in inventories, and further decreases in production, and lesser FOPs being hired, resulting in another fall in spending
- There will be a multiplied fall in real GDP form $Y_1$ to $Y_3$ due to the reverse multiplier effect
- The resulting rise in unemployment as reflected by the output gap $Y_1 - Y_3$ means that firms are better able to get the resources that they need
- This results in more efficient factor combinations and falling unit costs of production, reducing inflationary pressure
## Evaluation
### Inclusive and sustainable growth
- To achieve inclusive growth, the discretionary fiscal policy tool that are adopted to increase AD will also need to bring about improved income equality and greater equity
- E.g. Targeted transfer payments for the lower income/ skilled labor, income tax cuts for lower income groups
- This can increase consumption and hence AD, and also ensure the welfare of the less well-off will be raised
- E.g. We can also increase taxes on the rich and provide greater transfer payments for the poor
- The redistribution of income will lead to greater inclusive growth, and there will be an increase in real output
- This is because the MPC is higher for the poor
- The rise in consumption by the poor from the transfer payments will exceed the fall in consumption by the rich due to the fall in disposable income because of the higher income taxes
- To attain sustainable growth, the fiscal policy adopted will encourage or utilise sustainable methods of production
- E.g increased government spending on green energy efforts such as solar power
- This can increase AD and AS, and ensure that the energy industry will emit lesser pollution and creating a cleaner environment and a more sustainable future
### Crowding out effect
- Crowding out effect occurs when the government has to borrow in order to finance government expenditure
- This happens when governments have become debt-ridden from years of fiscal budget deficits and do not have sufficient fiscal reserves to fund its fiscal plans
- The borrowing by the government will result in an increase in loanable funds, which will increase interest rates
- This will increase the cost of borrowing
- Households will have more incentive to save, and borrowers will borrow lesser to spend on goods and services, lowering C
- Firms will cut back on investment as the rate of return on investment for some projects is now lower than the interest cost, lowering I
- Thus, the increase in government spending (G) will be offset by the fall in C and I
- Hence, expansionary fiscal policy may be less effective for government that have to finance the increase in government expenditure through borrowing
### Size of multiplier
- It will be difficult for fiscal policy to raise output and employment levels for countries with a small multiplier due to a higher marginal propensity to withdraw
- For the US, where there is a consumerist culture, MPC is high, and there is a large multiplier, and fiscal policy will be effective in influencing output and employment
- Singapore, which is resource scarce, has a high MPM, and there is a small multiplier, and the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy would be limited
### Size of domestic sector
- An expansionary fiscal policy aimed at increasing C and I through lower direct taxes might not have much import for a country with a small domestic sector
- Singapore's domestic consumption expenditure only accounts for 37% of GDP, making fiscal policy not effective
- Australia's domestic sector is larger, accounting for 58% of GDP
- The impact of fiscal policy is limited if the government sector and domestic private sector are small compared to the export sector
- When Singapore is hit by a global recession, government expenditure will usually be increased, but it is likely not enough to makeup for the fall in export revenue
- This is because external demand takes up a larger percentage of GDP
### Investor and consumer confidence
- Given poor consumer sentiments and uncertainty in economic outlook, consumers may be worried about job security and expect falls in future income
- Thus, they may without consumption and increase precautionary savings
- They also believe any tax cuts now would worsen the budget position, and only bring about tax increases in the future when the government repays its debt if they borrow
- They may not spend the increase in disposable income from tax cuts
- Firms are pessimistic about their rate of return on investment, with poor consumer sentiments and expected fall in sales
- They see little incentive in expanding their capacity to produce
- Hence, during a recession, low confidence in the economy would make consumption and investment unresponsive to tax cuts, limiting a governments ability to stimulate AD
