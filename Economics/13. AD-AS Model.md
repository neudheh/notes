## AD- AS model
- The aggregate goods and services market is the market for all goods and services that makes up a country's national output or GDP
- A country's real GDP level is determined by the intersection between aggregate demand and aggregate supply of domestic output
- General price level (average price of goods of the entire economy) is plotted onto the vertical axis while quantity is the real GDP (final value of output of the entire economy)
## Aggregate demand (AD)
- ==Aggregate demand refers to the total demand for domestically produced final goods and services that buyers collectively desire to purchase at each general price level (GPL) in a given time period==
- AD is given by the sum of planned consumption expenditure, (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports expenditure (X - M) $$AD = C + I + G+ (X-M)$$
### Why is the AD curve downward sloping?
- The AD curve is downwards sloping as when GPL rises, the real GDP falls
- This is due to the wealth/ real balances effect, the interest rate effect, or the International substitution effect
### Wealth/ real balances effect
- The wealth of households includes the values of financial assets (bank deposits, shares and bonds), and physical assets (property, gold) that households have
- Assuming unchanged nominal wealth, a fall in the GPL causes the real value of household's wealth to rise
- This increases their purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services at this GPL
- Hence, consumption rises, causing a rise in real GDP
### Interest rate effect
- When the GPL falls, the price of everything is lower, and households and firms will need less money to conduct their usual activities
- This will cause them to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds
- This places downward pressure on interest rates
- The fall in interest rates will make it cheaper for households to borrow to purchase goods and services on credit
- It also makes it cheaper for firms to borrow for investments since the cost of borrowing money has fallen
- Thus, C and I rise, causing a rise in the real GDP
### International substitution effect
- When the domestic GPL falls, assuming no changes in foreign exchange rate and foreign prices, the price of domestic goods relative to foreign  goods fall
- Domestic goods become more price competitive, causing import expenditure to decrease as households switch to buying relatively cheaper domestic goods
- Export revenue rises as foreigners buy more local goods
- Hence, net export revenue rises, causing a rise in real GDP
>[!NOTE]
>These effects arise due to a change in price level and is reflected as a movement along the AD curve (only a change in AS can trigger these effects)
## Causes of shifts in AD - C
- Planned consumption expenditure consists of 2 components
	- Autonomous consumption (changes in consumption expenditure due to non-income factors)
	- Induced consumption (changes in consumption expenditure due to changes in income)
- When considering factors that cause a shift in AD, we are only looking at non-income factors
- Induced consumption only cause subsequent shifts in AD, and is not the trigger for the shift in AD
### Expectation about future income level
 - Optimism about the future state of the economy leads to higher consumer confidence
 - When households expect the economy to do well, they expect their income levels to rise
 - They will increase their consumption, as they are now more willing to buy big-ticket items such as cars
 - This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Expectation of changes in real wealth
- If households expect and increase in the real value of their wealth, households will save less and be more willing to consume more 
- They will feel wealthier and demand more goods and services, increasing consumption
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Expectation about future changes in GPL
- If households expect the inflation rate to rise, they will bring forward their consumption to avoid paying higher prices in the future
- Current consumption increases as households are more willing to consume goods and services now
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Availability of credit
- A credit crunch is a condition in which banks stop or slow lending of funds to business or individuals by tightening the conditions to take a loan
- When banks are more cautious in lending, the inability by households to obtain a loan will lead to a reduction in consumption
- This lowers aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a leftward shift in AD
### Interest rate
- When the interest rate falls, the cost of borrowing money is lower
- Households are more willing to borrow and increase spending since the interest payment on loans for cars and other consumer durables is now lower and more affordable
- A fall in interest rate also deceases the returns on savings, and households will save less and consumer more
- Hence households are more willing to consume more in the current period because the opportunity cost of borrowing is lower
- This causes a rise in consumption
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Personal income tax
- Disposable income is the income that is available for consumption or savings after deducting income taxes and other compulsory contributions and adding transfer payments from the government
- If a government imposes a higher personal income tax, households will face a fall in their disposable income
- This reduces their purchasing power, and households would consume lesser goods and services, leading to a fall in consumption
- This lowers aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a leftward shift in AD
## Causes of shifts in AD - I
- Investment is the process of creating capital goods not for current consumption, but for the expansion of productive capacity of the economy
### Interest rate
- Interest rate is the cost of investment by firms
- The lower the interest rate, the less expensive it will be for firms to finance their investment
- This is because firms finance the purchase of capital either by borrowing, which requires them to pay interest to their creditors
- They can also finance it by using undistributed profits, which causes them to forgo the interest earned if they had placed these profits in a bank
- According to the marginalist principle, profit maximising firms will invest to the point where the MB of investment (expected rate of returns) = MC of investment (interest rate)
- When the interest rate falls, there will be units on investment that were previously unprofitable (MC > MB), but are now profitable
- This is because the interest rate is now lesser than the expected rate of returns, increasing investment
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Availability of credit
- Most firms depend on bank loans for investment
- When there is a credit crunch where banks are less willing/ less able to provide credit, businesses will hold back on investments
- This lowers aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a leftward shift in AD
### Expected rate of returns
#### Expectations of future business conditions
- When firms expect an expanding economy and improved profit margins in the future, they will want to invest more
- Units of investment that were previously unprofitable are now profitable, increasing investment
- This is because the expected rate of returns, the MB of investment, is now greater than the interest rate, the MC of investment
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
#### Technological advancement
- Process or product innovation give rise to new businesses opportunities, and hence expectations of higher yield from the investment
- Units of investment that were previously unprofitable are now profitable, increasing investment
- This is because the expected rate of returns, the MB of investment, is now greater than the interest rate, the MC of investment
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
#### Corporate tax rate
- A fall in corporate tax rates will increase the expected rate of after tax profits on investment
- Units of investment that were previously unprofitable are now profitable, increasing investment
- This is because the expected rate of returns, the MB of investment, is now greater than the interest rate, the MC of investment
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
## Cause of shifts in AD - G
- Government expenditure is spending by the government used to purchase goods and services
### Government policy
 - When a government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy by increasing government policy, the resultant increase in government spending is likely to increase AD
 - This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Access to credit
- A government will need to borrow money to spend when the tax revenue earned is lesser than their expenditure (i.e. budget deficit)
- The government would finance the deficit by borrowing from individuals or banks, by issuing government bonds/ securities
- When governments persistently run big budget deficits, its creditors may be concerned about its ability to pay back the loans
- They would threaten to stop lending until the deficit is reduced, and would cause governments to reduce government spending
- This reduces aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a leftward shift in AD
## Cause of shifts in AD - (X-M)
- Import expenditure (M) is the amount spent by residents of a country on foreign imports
- Export revenue (X) is the amount spent by foreigners on domestic goods and services
- The net exports is the export revenue - import expenditure
### Foreign income levels
- When foreigners have more income, they will have higher purchasing power, and would demand more goods and services, including exports, increasing export revenue
- This increases net exports
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Prices of foreign goods relative to domestic prices
- An increase in foreign prices would cause domestic goods to become relatively cheaper, and residents of a country would demand lesser imports
- If demand for imports is price elastic, the increase in foreign prices will lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity of imports
- As the fall in import expenditure from the fall in quantity demanded of imports is greater than the rise in import expenditure from the rise in prices, import expenditure falls
- Foreigners would also demand more of our exports, as it is relatively cheaper, causing demand for export to rise, increasing export revenue
- This increases net exports
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Exchange rate
- If the Singapore dollar depreciates, the prices of Singaporean exports would become relatively cheaper in foreign countries
- Foreigners would also demand more of our exports, as it is relatively cheaper, causing demand for export to rise, increasing export revenue
- Singaporeans would find the price of imports to be more expensive, and would purchase more Singaporean goods and services as they are relatively cheaper
- This reduces the quantity demanded for imported goods
- Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the depreciation of the Singapore dollar would lead to a rise in net exports
- This increases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a rightward shift in AD
### Protectionism
- Governments may implement protectionist policy measures to restrict free trade to overcome the negative impact that free trade brings
- For example, an export quota would cause export revenue to fall
- Assuming import expenditure remains constant, net exports will fall
- This decreases aggregate demand for goods and services at every price level, as represented by a leftward shift in AD
## Multiplier effect
- Assuming the economy is initially operating within spare capacity, a rise in AD form $AD_0$ to $AD_!$ would lead to AD exceeding the current level of output
- Firms will see an unplanned fall in inventories, and will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- They will pay more factor income, and national output/ income increases
- As households receive more factor income for their factor services, a portion of the additional income will be spent on domestic good and services, causing a rise in induced consumption
- The rest is saved, used to pay taxes or imports
- AD thus increases from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- This creates another round of unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to hire more factors of production to increase production, paying out more factor income
- Households will spend part of the additional income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining goes to taxes, savings and imports
- The process repeats until total withdrawals equal total injections, and a new national income is achieved
- This also applies for a fall in AD
>[!EXAMPLE]-
>**Mathamatical illustration**
>Out of every $1 of additional income, $0.50 is spend on domestic consumer goods and services, $0.15 is saved, $0.25 is taxed and $0.10 is spent on imports
> - Therefore, $$MPC_d = 0.5, MPS - 0.15, MPT = 0.25, MPM = 0.1$$
>	- MPC: marginal propensity to consume domestically produced goods and services $(\Delta C_D/ \Delta y)$
>	- MPS: marginal propensity to save $(\Delta S/ \Delta y)$
>	- MPT: marginal propensity to tax$(\Delta T/ \Delta y)$
>	- MPM: marginal propensity to import $(\Delta T/ \Delta y)$
> - Assuming spare capacity, A firm builds a plant costing \$100m, making an investment of \$100m, leading to a rise in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$
> - AD exceeds the current level of output, and there is an unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to increase output by $100m by hiring more factors of production
> - Households see a rise in income by $100m, and real national income will increase from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ as they receive their factor payments
> - Those receiving $100m will spend a portion of their additional income on domestically produced consumer goods and services, causing a rise in induced consumption
>- The rest is withdrawn form the circular flow of income, and is saved, used to pay taxes and spent on imports
>- Since $MPC_D$ = 0.5, households will increase spending on domestically produced consumer goods and services by $50m, increasing AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
>- There will be increased in the country's income by $50m, which is lesser than the initial increase by $100m due to withdrawals
>- This process continues with each new round of spending on domestic goods, until total withdrawals = total injections
>- A new equilibrium is reached at $E_1$, where the change in income is $200m
>- In the end, AD increased from $AD_0$ to $AD_3$ and GDP increased from $Y_0$ to $Y_3$
### Size of multiplier
- The multiplier, $k$, refers to the number of times by which a rise in equilibrium national income exceeds the rise in autonomous expenditure$$k = \frac{1}{1-MPC_D} = \frac{1}{MPW}$$
	- $MPC_D$: Marginal propensity to consume domestically produced goods and services
	- $MPW$: Marginal propensity to withdraw = Sum of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
- Change in equilibrium national income, $\Delta Ye = k\times \Delta Autonomous\ Expenditure$
- The higher the $MPW$, the smaller the size of the multiplier
- $MPW$ is dependent on the size of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
#### MPS
**County's attitude towards thrift**
- Americans have a high level of consumers compared to asians, who regard savings as a virtue
- The propensity to save in American households is lower than Asian households, causing the US to have a larger multiplier
**Social security system**
- Some countries have a high savings rate because their government does not provide a strong social safety net (pension benefits, free healthcare)
- Households in these countries then want to put aside more savings in order to prepare for retirement and old age expenditure
**Government policy**
- Singapore has the highest savings rate in the world due to compulsory savings in the from of CPF contributions
**Distribution of income**
- As higher income groups have a higher $MPS$ than lower income groups, a more inequitable distribution of income increases $MPS$ and lowers multiplier size
#### MPT - Tax systems
- A country with a high tax rate will have a higher $MPT$ and thus a smaller multiplier size
#### MPM - Factor endowments
- Due to a lack of natural resources, Singapore has to import most of her consumer goods and industrial raw materials
- Thus, its $MPM$ is relatively higher, causing the size of multiplier to be smaller
### Extent of multiplier effect
#### Leakages
- The size of the multiplier effect is dependent on the size of $MPW$/ $MPC_D$ 
- With a higher $MPW$, more additional income is lost as leakages, and less is spent on domestically produced goods and services
- This reduces the rounds of spending in the multiplier process, and hence the overall increase in national income would be smaller
#### Lack of spare capacity
- The multiplier effect only happens when there is spare capacity in an economy
- Once an economy reaches full employment, any further increases in expenditure will only cause the general price level to rises, increasing nominal national income
#### Structural rigidities
- Even if there is spare capacity, the multiplier can be limited due to structural bottlenecks (e.g. lack of certain types of resources like skilled labour, fixed capital, enterprise)
- When there are insufficient resources for production, the increase in national output at each round of the multiplier process may be limited
#### Time lag
- It takes time for the multiplier effect to work, from several weeks to months for each successive round of spending to happen
## Aggregate supply (AS)
- ==The aggregate supply (AS) shows the level of domestic output that firms collectively desire to produce at different general price levels==
### Why is the AS curve like that?
- For the horizontal range of the AS curve (short-run AS), there is still spare capacity in the economy.
	- Firms do not need to result to inefficient combinations of factors of production, and this will not drive up the unit cost of production
	- They are willing and able to increase output at the same GPL
- Over the upward sloping range of the AS curve, as firms increase output towards $Y_f$, production becomes less efficient
	 - They will use to resources that are less and less suitable for production
	 - Thus, more labour and other inputs are needed per additional unit of output produced, causing the unit cost of production to rise
	 - Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices
	 - Hence, GPL rises firms produce closer to $Y_f$
 - Along the vertical range (long-run AS), the economy has reached full employment $Y_f$
	 - Output can no longer rise as resources are fully employed
	 - Firms are unable to increase output regardless of increases in the GPL
	 - If AD were to rise, only the GPL would increase, with no real change in real output
## Shifts in short-run AS
- These factors affect the unit cost of production, but does not affect the country's productive capacity
### Price of factor inputs
- Increase in prices of key domestic or imported inputs like crude oil or other raw materials will drive up the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
### Exchange rates
- Depreciation in the value of the domestic currency would cause the price of imported inputs to rise, increasing the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
### Government policies
#### Indirect tax rates
- An increase in indirect tax rates like GST will increase the unit cost of production, causing a fall in AS, shifting AS to the left
#### Government regulation
- It is expensive for firms to comply with regulations, increasing the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
## Shifts in long-run AS
- These affect the quantity, quality and technology of the country's resources, which affects the productive capacity
### Government policies affecting quantity of resources
- Government policies pertaining to domestic or foreign direct investment may affect a country's productive capacity 
- E.g. tax incentives, opening more sectors of the economy to attract investment
- This will increase the rate of capital accumulation
- If the rate of capital accumulation is greater than the rate of capital depreciation, capital stock will rise, increasing the productive capacity
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
---
- Immigration and foreign labour policies include controlling the inflow of people into the country or immigrants needing to require permission to work in the work force
- This reduce the number of foreign workers firms can hire, reducing the total labour force, especially with a ageing population
- This is because the number of people leaving the work force is greater than the number of new entrants to the work force
- The quantity of labour falls, causing long-run AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
### Change in quality of labour input
- An increase in education and training in an economy due to an increase in investment in human capital will increase the skills of its people (quality of labour increases)
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Change in technology
- Investment in new technology improves capital productivity, increasing potential output for all goods and services
- This is because new technology is more efficient than old technology
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Natural disasters
- Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis can destroy and permanently decrease the capital stock of the country
- This lowers firms ability to produce, lowering productive capacity
- This causes AS to fall, and shift to the left
