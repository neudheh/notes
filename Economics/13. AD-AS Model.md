- The aggregate goods and services market is the market for all goods and services that make up a country's national output or GDP
- A countries real GDP level is determined by the intersection between aggregate demand and aggregate supply of domestic output
- Price level is plotted on the vertical axis, while national output is plotted on the horizontal axis
- The price level is the price of the entire economy, or the general price level (GPL)
## Aggregate demand
- ==The aggregate demand refers to the total demand of domestically produced final goods and services that buyers collectively desire to purchase at each general price level (GPL) in a given time period==
- The AD for domestic output that can be found by summing planned consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports expenditure of goods and services (X-M)
$$AD = C + I +G + (X-M)$$
- (X-M) refers to the demand for domestic goods and services only
## Why is the AD curve downwards sloping?
- The AD curve is downwards sloping to reflect the inverse relationship between the general price level and real GDP
- When there is a increase in GPL, there will be a fall in real GDP due to these effects
### Wealth / real balances effect
- The wealth of households include the value of financial assets (e.g. bank deposits, shares and bonds) and physical assets (e.g. houses, land) that households have
- Assuming unchanged nominal wealth, a fall in the GPL will increase the real value of households wealth
- As their purchasing power has increased, they are more willing to consume more goods and services at this lower GPL, hence consumption increases, causing a rise in real GDP
### Interest rate effect
- When the average price of everything is lower, households will need lesser money to conduct their normal activities
- This allows them to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds
- This places downward pressure in interests rate, making it cheaper for households to borrow to purchase consumer goods and services on credit
- Firms can also borrow more as the cost of borrowing money has fallen
- Thus, C and I rise, causing a rise in real GDP
### International substitution effect
- When domestic GPL falls, assuming no change in foreign exchange rate and foreign prices, the price of domestic goods relative to foreign falls
- Domestic goods become more price competitive than foreign goods
- Thus, import expenditure (M) decreases as households switch to buying relatively cheaper domestic goods
- Export revenue (X) increases as foreigners buy more local goods
- Thus net export revenue increases, causing a rise in real GDP
>[!NOTE]
>These effects arise due to a change in price level and is reflected as a movement along the AD curve (only a change in AS can trigger these effects)
### Causes in shifts of AD
- A shift in AD occurs if, for any price level, there is a change in factors affecting one or more of its components (C, I, G, or (X-M))
- AD only shifts due to other factors other than GPL
## Shifts in AD due to autonomous consumption
- Planned consumption expenditure consists of two components
	- Autonomous consumption, which are changes in consumption due to non income factors
	- Induced consumption, which are changes in consumption doe to changes in income
- Autonomous consumption causes initial shifts in AD, while induced consumption reflects subsequent shifts in AD due to the [[#Multiplier effect]]
- When considering factors that trigger a shift in AD, we are interested in non-income factors (factors that affect autonomous consumption)
### Expectations about future income level
- Optimism about the future state of the economy leads to high consumer confidence
- When households expect the economy to do well, they expect their income levels to rise in the future
- This stimulate consumption as consumers are now more willing to purchase big-ticket items such as cars and luxury watches
- This rise in autonomous consumption causes AD to rise at every price level, which makes the AD curve shift to the right
- Pessimism and anticipation of an economic downturn would cause consumers to cut back on their expenditure, causing a fall in autonomous consumption
- This leads to a fall in AD at every price, causing the AD curve to shift to the left
### Expectation of changes in household's real wealth
- If households expect an increase in the real value of their wealth, they will save less and be more willing to consume more
- This causes a rise in autonomous consumption, leading to a rise in AD, which is reflected by a rightwards shift
- An anticipation of a fall in real value of household's wealth will then result in more saving and less spending
- This causes a fall in autonomous consumption, leading to a fall in AD, which is reflected by a leftwards shift
### Expectation about future changes of GPL
- If households expect the inflation rate to rise, they will bring forward their consumption to avoid paying highe,Tr prices in the future
- This causes an increase in the willingness of households to consume goods and services now
- This causes a rise in autonomous consumption, leading to a rise in AD, which is reflected by a rightwards shift
- Conversely, if households expect the inflation rate to become negative, they will defer their spending
- This causes a fall in autonomous consumption, leading to a fall in AD, which is reflected by a leftwards shift
### Availability of credit
- A credit crunch is when banks stop lending or slow lending of funds to businesses or individuals by tightening the conditions to obtain a loan
- When banks are more cautious in lending, the inability by households to obtain loans to buy big-ticket items will lead to a fall in consumption
- This causes a fall in autonomous consumption, leading to a fall in AD, which is reflected by a leftwards shift
- On the other hand, when there is easy credit, where loans are easily obtained from banks, consumption will be encouraged
- This causes a rise in autonomous consumption, leading to a rise in AD, which is reflected by a rightwards shift
### Interest rate
- When interest rate falls, the cost of borrowing money is lower
- This increases household's willingness to borrow and hence increases spending as the interest payment on loans for cars and other items are now lower and more affordable
- A fall in interest rate also decreases the return on savings
- Household's willingness to consume more is increased as the opportunity cost of consumption is lowest, which is the interest earned from saving
- This causes a rise in autonomous consumption, leading to a rise in AD, which is reflected by a rightwards shift
- The reverse is also true
### Personal income tax rate
- Disposable income is the income that is available for consumption or savings after deducting income taxes and other compulsory contributions, and adding transfer payments from the government
- If a government imposes a higher personal income tax rate, households will face a fall in their disposable income, reducing their willingness and ability to consume
- This causes a fall in autonomous consumption, leading to a fall in AD, which is reflected by a leftwards shift
## Shifts in AD due to investment expenditure
- Investment is the process of creating capital goods not for current consumption, but for the expansion of the productive capacity of the economy
- Investment consists of 
	- Fixed investment - Spending on plant and equipment (capital goods)
	- Inventories - raw materials, semi-finished goods and final products waiting to be sold
	- Residential housing - Investment in housing
- When investing, firms consider the MB and MC of investing (marginalist principle)
### Interest rate
- Interest rate is the cost of investment by firms
- The lower the interest rate, the less expensive it will be for firms to finance their investment
- This is because firms finance the purchase of capital by 
	- borrowing, which requires them to pay interest to their creditors, or by
	- using their undistributed profits, forgoing the interest earned if they placed these profits in the bank
- When the interest rate falls, there will be units of investment which were previously unprofitable (MB < MC), but now profitable as the expected rate of return is higher than the interest rate
- This causes investment expenditure to increase, leading to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
- The level of investment is inversely related to the interest rate
### Availability of credit
- When there is a credit crunch, where banks are less willing and/ or less able to provide credit, business investments will be curtailed
- This causes investment expenditure to fall, leading to a fall in AD, causing AD to shift to the left
- On the other hand, when credit can be easily obtained from banks, investment level of the country is likely to rise
- This causes investment expenditure to increase, leading to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
### Expected rate of return on the investment
- This refers to the rate derived from the expected stream of future earnings from an investment project over a time period
- When the expected rate of return on the investment increases, some units of investment which were previously unprofitable are now profitable as the expected rate of returns is now greater than the interest rate
- This causes investment expenditure to increase, leading to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
#### Expectation about future business conditions
- When firms expect an expanding economy and improved profit margins in the future, they will want to increase their capacity by buying more capital
- This causes investment expenditure to increase, leading to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
- Likewise, an expectation of an economic downturn in the future will cause firms to cut down on their investment
- This causes investment expenditure to fall, leading to a fall in AD, causing AD to shift to the left
- Changes in the expected rate of return of investment is a major cause in a country's overall investment and hence, AD
#### Technological advancement
- Product or process innovation gives rise to new business opportunities, and hence expectations of higher yield from the investment
#### Corporate tax rate
- A fall in corporate tax rate will increase the expected rate of after-tax profits on investment
- This causes firms to demand more capital goods, increasing investment expenditure
## Shifts in AD due to government expenditure
- Government expenditure refers to planned expenditure undertaken by the government, whether goods and services for current consumption or expansion of the productive capacity of the economy
- For G, it has to be spending by the government which is directly used to purchase goods and services
### Government policy in response to the state of the economy
- Some government actively intervene to stabilize fluctuations in AD
- When the government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy by increasing government spending, the increase in government spending is likely to increase AD 
- This causes the AD curve to shift to the right
- This could be used to stimulate the economy
### Access to credit
- A government will need to borrow money to spend when the tax revenue earned is lesser then their expenditure (i.e. the government runs a budget deficit)
- The government borrows money form individuals or banks by issuing bonds or securities
- When a government persistently runs big budget deficits and creditors are concerned about the governments ability to return the loans, they could threaten to stop lending unless they reduce their deficit
- This would lower government spending, causing AD to fall, causing AD to shift to the left
## Shifts in AD due to net export expenditure
- Export revenue (X) is planned expenditure by foreigners on domestically produced goods and services
- Import expenditure is planned expenditure by residents of a country on foreign goods and services
### Foreign income levels
- A country's export revenue depends on the income level of foreigners, and hence their purchasing power
- An increase/ decrease in foreign income, ceteris paribus, will lead to an increase/ decrease in demand by foreigners as they have more/ less purchasing power
- This will lead to an increase/ decrease in the economy's export revenue, leading to a rise in net export expenditure
- This is assuming that the country produces normal goods
### Prices of foreign produced goods relative to domestic prices
- An increase in foreign prices, ceteris paribus, will cause domestic households to increase their purchase of the now relatively cheaper domestically produced goods instead of imported goods
- If demand for the imports is price elastic, this increase in foreign prices will lead to a more than proportional fall in quantity demanded, and import expenditure falls
- An increase in foreign prices, ceteris paribus, will also cause foreigners to increase their purchase of now relatively cheaper imports instead of their domestically produced goods
- Demand for exports and hence export revenue increases
- As net export expenditure increases, AD rises, causing AD to shift to the right
### Exchange rate
- If the Singapore dollar depreciates (weakens in value), price of Singapore's exports in term of foreign currency falls
- Foreigners will purchase more Singapore goods and services which are relatively cheaper instead of domestically produced goods and services
- This causes export revenue to rise
- Singaporeans will now find that imported goods and services are now more expensive in terms of domestic currency
- They will purchase more Singapore goods and services instead because these have become relatively cheaper, and reduce their quantity demand for imported goods
- This causes import expenditure to fall
- Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the deprecation of Singapore dollar causes net export expenditure to increase, causing AD to increase and shift to the right
### Protectionism
- Governments may adopt protectionist policy measures to restrict free trade to overcome the negative impact that free trade brings
- For example, a government imposes an export quota to protect domestic firms form temporary shortages of specific materials
- This causes export revenue to fall, and assuming import expenditure remains constant, net import expenditure will fall, causing AD to fall
## Multiplier effect
- Assuming that the economy is initially operating with spare capacity, an increase in AD  form $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ would lead to AD exceeding the current level of output
- Firms will see an unplanned fall in inventories, and will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- They will pay more factor income, and national output/ income increases
- As households receive more factor income for their factor services, they will spend a portion of the additional income on domestic goods ans services, causing a rise in induced consumption, and thus AD rises from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- This creates another round of unplanned fall in inventories in other industries
- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
- Thus, there is a multiplied increase in national income from $Y_0$ to $Y_3$ due to the multiplier effect, assuming spare capacity in the economy
- It also applies for a fall in AD
### Mathematical illustration
- Out of every $1 of additional income, $0.50 is spend on domestic consumer goods and services, $0.15 is saved, $0.25 is taxed and $0.10 is spent on imports
- Therefore, $$MPC_d = 0.5, MPS - 0.15, MPT = 0.25, MPM = 0.1$$
	- MPC: marginal propensity to consume domestically produced goods and services $(\Delta C_D/ \Delta y)$
	- MPS: marginal propensity to save $(\Delta S/ \Delta y)$
	- MPT: marginal propensity to tax$(\Delta T/ \Delta y)$
	- MPM: marginal propensity to import $(\Delta T/ \Delta y)$
- Assuming spare capacity, A firm builds a plant costing $100m, making an investment of $100m, leading to a rise in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$
- AD exceeds the current level of output, and there is an unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to increase output by $100m by hiring more factors of production
- Households see a rise in income by $100m, and real national income will increase from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$ as they receive their factor payments
- Those receiving $100m will spend a portion of their additional income on domestically produced consumer goods and services, causing a rise in induced consumption
- They rest is withdrawn form the circular flow of income, and is saved, used to pay taxes and spent on imports
- Since $MPC_D$ = 0.5, households will increase spending on domestically produced consumer goods and services by $50m, increasing AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- There will be increased in the country's income by $50m, which is lesser than the initial increase by $100m due to withdrawals
- This process continues with each new round of spending on domestic goods, until total withdrawals = total injections
- A new equilibrium is reached at $E_1$, where the change in income is $200m
- In the end, AD increased from $AD_0$ to $AD_3$ and GDP increased from $Y_0$ to $Y_3$
## Factors affecting size of multiplier
- Change in equilibrium national income, $\Delta Ye = k \times \Delta autonomous\ expenditure$
- The multiplier ($k$), refers to the number of times by which a rise in equilibrium national income exceeds the rise in autonomous expenditure$$k = \frac{1}{1-MPC_D} = \frac{1}{MPW}$$
	- $MPC_D$: Marginal propensity to consume domestically produced goods and services
	- $MPW$: Marginal propensity to withdraw = Sum of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
- The higher the MPW, the smaller the size of the multiplier
- MPW is depended on the size of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
### MPS
#### Country's attitude towards thrift
- Americans have higher levels of consumerism relative to their Asian counter parts who regards savings as a virtue
- The propensity to save in American households is much lower compared to Asian households, leading to a lower MPS
#### Social security system
- Some countries have a higher savings rate because their government do not provide a strong social safety net (pension benefits, free healthcare)
- Households are compelled to put aside more savings to prepare for retirement and old age expenditure, leading to a higher MPS
#### Government policy
- Singapore has one of the highest saving rate in the world due to compulsory savings in the form of CPF contributions
#### Distribution of income
- Higher income groups have higher MPS than lower income groups
- A more inequitable distribution of income increases MPS and lowers the multiplier value
### MPT - Tax systems
- A country with a higher tax rate will have a higher MPT and a smaller multiplier size
### MPM - Factor endowments
- Singapore has to import most of her consumer goods and raw industrial materials as we have no natural resources
- MPM is higher compared to a country with larger factor endowments like the US
## Factors affecting extent of multiplier effect
### Leakages
- The size of the multiplier effect is depended on the size of the $MPW$/ $MPC_D$
- With a higher MPW, more of the increase in income is leaked out of the circular flow in each round, and less is spent on induced consumption of domestically produced goods and services
- This reduces the rounds of spending in the multiplier process, and the overall increase in national income will be smaller
### Lack of spare capacity
- The multiplier effect and generate increases in real income, employment and output only if there is spare capacity in the economy
- One an economy reaches full employment, any further increases in expenditure will only increase nominal national income (inflation sets in GPL increases instead of output)
### Structural rigidities
- Even if there is spare capacity, the multiplier can be limited due to structural bottlenecks 
- E.g. lack of certain types of resources such as skilled labour, fixed capital, enterprise
- When there are insufficient resources for production, the increase at national output at each round of the multiplier process may be limited
### Time lag
- It takes time for the multiplier to work, and in the real world, this could be weeks, or months for each successive round of spending to happen
## Aggregate Supply
- ==The aggregate supply shows the level of domestic output that firms collectively desire to produce at different price levels==
### Why is the AS curve like that?
- The horizontal rage of the AS curve (Short run AS), there is spare capacity in the economy
- Firms are able to employ resources that are suitable for their production and do not need to resort to inefficient combinations of factors of productions which will drive up unit COP
- They are thus willing and able to increase output at the same GPL
- At the upwards sloping portion, when output rises, GPL increases
- As firms increase output, the economy experiences a resource constraint, which reduces efficiency
- E.g. firms may use less suitable standby machines or employ additional less efficient workers
- This causes factor costs to rise more rapidly than total output, causing unit COP to rise
- Ceteris paribus, firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices, causing the AS curve to become steeper
- Along the vertical range (long run AS), the economy is at full employment
- Output can no longer rise as resources are fully employed, and firms cannot increase output regardless of increases in the GPL
- If AD rises, only the GPL increases, with no change in real output
## Shifts in short run aggregate supply
- These factors affect the firms unit cost of production, but does not affect the country's productive capacity in the short term
### Price of factor inputs
- Increases in price of either key domestic or imported inputs like crude oil or other raw materials will drive up the firms unit cost of production, causing AS to fall
- The horizontal portion of AS shifts left 
>[!NOTE]
>Look at the corner of the AS graph!!!!
### Exchange rate
- Depreciation in the value of the domestic currency will mean that domestic firms will face a higher price of imported inputs in terms of domestic currency
	- This drives up unit COP, decreasing AS, causing the horizontal of AS to shift left
### Government policies
#### Indirect tax rates
- An increase in indirect tax rates **on producers**, will increase the unit COP to rise, decreasing AS, causing the horizontal of AS to shift left
#### Government regulation
- It is expensive for firms to comply with regulations, increasing their unit COP, decreasing AS, causing the horizontal of AS to shift left
- E.g. Anti-pollution law, minimum wage
## Shifts in long run aggregate supply
- These factors affect the country's productive capacity
- These are factors that affect the quantity and/or the quality of the country's resources
### Government policies that affect quantity of resources
- Government policies pertaining to domestic to foreign direct investments may affect the country's productive capacity
- E.g. Some governments provide tax incentives and open more sectors of the economy to attract foreign direct investments
- This will increase the country's rate of capital accumulation, and if gross investment exceeds capital deprecation, capital stock will rise
- This will increase the country's productive capacity, increasing AS and shifting AS curve to the right

- On the other hand, immigration and foreign labour policies have an impact on an country's labour resources
- These policies may include the control of inflow of foreign labour who want to establish residence within the borders of the country, and the requiring of permission ot participate in the labour market (i.e. work permits)
- When we restrict the number of foreign labour that firms can hire, the total labour force may decline
- This is especially true for Singapore, which has an ageing population
- The rate of people retiring and leaving the work force is greater than the rate of people entering the work force, causing the overall work population to decline
- This causes AS to fall, and shift to the left
### Change in quality of labour input
- An increase in the educational levels and training in an economy due to and increase in investment in human capital will increase the skills of its people (i.e. quality of labour increases)
- This will increase the economy's ability to produce more goods and services
- This will increase the country's productive capacity, increasing AS and shifting AS curve to the right
### Change in technology
- Investment in new technology improves capital productivity (quality of capital increases) and increases potential output for all goods and services
- This is because newer technology is more productive and more efficient compared to older technology
- This will increase the country's productive capacity, increasing AS and shifting AS curve to the right
### Natural disasters
- Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis can destroy and permanently decrease the capital stock of the country
- This lowers firms ability to produce, lowering productive capacity
- This causes AS to fall, and shift to the left
