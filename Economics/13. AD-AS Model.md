- The aggregate goods and services market is the market for all goods and services that make up a country's national output, or GDP
- A country's GDP is determined by the intersection between AD and AS
- An AD-AS diagram has the general price level, GPL (price level of the entire economy) on the vertical axis, and the real GPD (value of the final output of the entire economy) on the horizontal axis
## Aggregate demand
- ==Aggregate demand refers to the total demand of domestically produced final goods and services that buyers collectively desire to purchase at each GPL in a given time period==
- AD is given by the some of planned consumption expenditure ($C$), investment expenditure ($I$), government expenditure ($G$), and net export expenditure on goods and services ($X-M$)
$$AD=C+I+G+(X-M)$$
### Why is AD downward sloping?
- The downward sloping nature of AD reflects the inverse relationship between GPL and real GDP
- When there is a change in GPL, there will be a corresponding change in the opposite direction in real GDP due to the following effects
#### Wealth effect
- The wealth of households include the value of financial assets (bank deposits, shares and bonds) and physical assets (houses, land)
- Assuming unchanged nominal wealth, a fall in the GPL would increase the real value of household's wealth
- As their purchasing power has increased, they are more willing to consume more goods and services at the lower GPL
- Hence, consumption rises, causing a rise in real GDP
#### Interest rate effect
- When the average price of everything is lower due to GPL falling, households and firms will need lesser money to conduct normal activities
- This allows them to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds
- This puts downward pressure on interest rates, making it cheaper for them to borrow to purchase consumer goods and services on credit
- Firms can also borrow for investment since the cost of borrowing has fallen
- Thus, $C$ and $I$ rise, causing a rise in real GDP
#### International substitution effect
- When the domestic GPL falls, assuming no change in the foreign exchange rate and foreign prices, the price of domestic goods and services relative to foreign goods fall
- Domestic goods become more price competitive compared to foreign goods
- Thus, import expenditure ($M$) decreases as households switch to buying the relatively cheaper domestic goods
- Export revenue ($X$) rises as foreigners buy more local goods
- Hence, net export revenue ($X-M$) rises, causing a rise in real GDP

>[!NOTE]
>These effects arise due to a change in price level and is reflected as a movement along the AD curve (only a change in AS can trigger these effects)
## Causes of shifts in AD (C)
- Planned consumption expenditure consists of two components
	- Autonomous consumption refers to changes in consumption expenditure due to changes in non income factors
	- Induced consumption refers to changes in consumption expenditure due to income
- When considering factors that trigger a shift in AD, we are interested in non-income factors
- Autonomous consumption is the the trigger for initial shifts in AD, and induced consumption is reflected in subsequent shifts in AD
### Expectation about future income levels
- Optimism about the future state of the economy leads to higher consumer confidence
- When households expect the economy to do well, they expect their income levels to rise
- This can stimulate consumption as consumers are now more willing to purchase big ticket items such as cars and luxury watches, causing AD to rise and shift to the right
### Expectation of changes in household's real wealth
- If households expect an increase in the real value of their wealth, they may save less and be more willing to consume more
- They feel 'wealthier' and demand more goods and services, causing AD to rise and shift to the right
### Expectation of future changes in the GPL
- If households expect the inflation rate to rise, they will bring forward their consumption to avoid paying higher prices in the future
- This causes an increase in the willingness of households to consume goods and services now
- This causes a rise in AD, and AD shift to the right
### Availability of credit
- A credit crunch is a condition where banks stop or slow lending of funds to individuals or businesses by tightening the conditions to earn a loan
- When banks are more cautious in lending, the inability by households to earn loans will lead to a reduction in consumption
- This would lead to a fall in AD, causing AD to shift to the left
- When there is easy credit, when loans are easily obtained from banks, consumption will be encouraged
- This would lead to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
### Interest rate
- When the interest falls, the cost of borrowing is lower
- Households will be more willing to borrow, and increase spending since the interest payment on loans for cars and consumer durables is now lower and more affordable
- A fall in interest rate also decreases the return on savings
- Thus, households are willing to consume more now as the opportunity cost of consumption is lower
- This would lead to a rise in AD, causing AD to shift to the right
### Personal income tax
- Disposable income is income that is available for consumption or savings after deducting income taxes and other compulsory contributions, and adding transfer payments from the government
- If the government raises the personal income tax, households will see a fall in disposable income, and this may reduce their willingness and ability to consume
- This would lead to a fall in AD, causing AD to shift to the left
## Causes of shifts in AD (I)
- Investment is the process of creating capital goods not for current consumption but for expansion of the productive capacity of the economy
### Interest rate
- Interest rate is the cost of investment by firms
- The lower the interest rate, the less expensive it will be for firms to finance their investment
- Firms finance their investment by either borrowing, which requires them to pay interest to their creditors, or by using undistributed profits, which causes them to forgo the interest earned if they had placed the profits in a bank
- The marginal benefit of investment, which is the expected rate of return, is now greater than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- There will be some units of investment that were previously unprofitable but are now profitable as the expected rate of return is now greater than the interest rate
- Thus, AD rises and shifts to the right
### Availability of credit
- When there is a credit crunch, where banks are less willing/ able to provide credit, business investments will be curtailed
- Thus, AD falls and shifts to the left
### Expected rate of return of investment
#### Expectations about future business conditions
- When firms expect an expanding economy, they will expect their profit margins to rise
- They will want to increase their capacity by buying more capital
- Investments thus rise, leading to a rise in AD and AD shifts to the right
- Changes in the expected rate of investment is a major cause of changes in a country's overall level of investment and hence AD
#### Technological advancement
- Product or process innovation give rise to new business opportunities, and hence expectations of higher yield from investment
- The marginal benefit of investment, which is the expected rate of return, is now greater than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- There will be some units of investment that were previously unprofitable but are now profitable as the expected rate of return is now greater than the interest rate
- Thus, AD rises and shifts to the right
#### Corporate tax rate
- A fall in the corporate tax rates will increase the expected rate of faster tax profits on investment
- The marginal benefit of investment, which is the expected rate of return, is now greater than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- There will be some units of investment that were previously unprofitable but are now profitable as the expected rate of return is now greater than the interest rate
- Thus, AD rises and shifts to the right
## Causes of shifts in AD (G)
- Government expenditure is planned expenditure undertaken by the government whether on goods and services for current consumption, or for the expansion of productive capacity of the economy
### Government policy
- Some governments actively intervene to stabilize fluctuations in AD
- When the government adopts and expansionary fiscal policy by increasing government spending, the government spending will increase AD and shift AD to the right
### Access to credit
- A government will need to borrow money to spend when the tax revenue earned is less than their expenditure
- The government borrows money from individuals and banks by issuing government bonds or securities
- A government may persistently run into big budget deficits and creditors will be concerned about the governments ability to repay the loans
- They could threaten to stop lending until the government reduces its deficit, causing the government to lower its spending
## Causes of shifts in AD (X-M)
- Import expenditure (M) is the amount spent by residents of a country on foreign imports
- Export revenue (X) is the amount spent by foreigners on domestic goods and services
- The net exports is the export revenue - import expenditure
### Foreign income levels
- A country's export revenue depends on the income level of foreigners, and hence their purchasing power
- A rise in foreign income levels would lead a rise in demand by foreigners as they have higher purchasing power and can afford to consume more goods and services
- This would lead to a rise in the economy's export revenue
- Thus AD rises, and shifts to the right
### Prices of foreign goods relative to domestic prices
- An increase in foreign prices will cause domestic households to switch to domestically produced goods as it is relatively cheaper
- If demand for the imports is price elastic, the increase in foreign prices will lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity of imports demanded, and import expenditure rises
- The rise in foreign price will also cause foreigners to increase their demand for the relatively cheaper imports instead of domestically produced goods
- Demand for exports and export revenue thus increase
- As $(X-M)$ increases, this will lead to an increase in AD, and AD will shift to the right
### Exchange rate
- If the Singapore dollar depreciates, the prices of Singapore goods in terms of foreign currency falls
- Foreigners will purchase more Singapore's goods and services as they are relatively cheaper, causing demand for Singapore's exports to rise
- Singaporeans will now find imported goods and services to be more expensive in terms of domestic currency
- They will purchase more domestic goods and services which are relatively cheaper, and reduce the quantity demanded for foreign goods
- Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the depreciation of the exchange rate will cause net export expenditure to rise
- As $(X-M)$ increases, this will lead to an increase in AD, and AD will shift to the right
### Protectionism
- Governments may adopt protectionist policy measures to restrict free trade to overcome the negative impact free trade brings
- If a government exposes an export quota to prevent domestic firms from temporary shortages of specific materials, export revenue will fall
- Assuming import expenditure remains constant, $(X-M)$ will fall, causing AD to fall
## Multiplier effect
- The multiplier effect occurs becuase injections of new demand into the circular flow of income stimulates further rounds of spending as expenditure by one party is income to another
- Assuming there is spare capacity in the economy, a rise in AD will lead to a multiplies rise in real GDP due to the multiplier effect
![[multiplier effect.png]]
- The economy was initially at equilibrium at $E_0$, with real GDP at $Y_0$
- A rise in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ will cause firms to see an unplanned fall in inventories, and they will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- Firms will pay out more factor income to households and national income rises from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$
- With a rise in income, households will spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services ($C$), increasing induced consumption
- The rest is withdrawn as savings ($S$), taxes ($T$), and import expenditure ($M$)
- The rise in induced CD will lead to another round of unplanned fall in firms inventories
- Firms then react by increasing production and hiring more factors of production
- They will pay more factor income to households and real GDP rises gain from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- Households will then spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services, causing a rise in induced Cd again, as well as another round of increase in withdrawals
- This will trigger multiple rounds of increases in income and the process continues until total withdrawals equal to total injections
- The economy reaches a new equilibrium at $E_1$ where $AD_3$ intersects the AS curve
- There is a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_0$ to $Y_3$
### Size of multiplier, K
- The multiplier ($k$) refers to the number of times by which a rise in equilibrium national income exceeds the rise in autonomous expenditure$$k = \frac{1}{1-MPC_d}=\frac{1}{MPW}$$
	- $MPC_D$: Marginal propensity to consume domestically produced goods and services
	- $MPW$: Marginal propensity to withdraw = Sum of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
- Change in equilibrium national income, $\Delta Ye = k\times \Delta Autonomous\ Expenditure$
- The higher the $MPW$, the smaller the size of the multiplier
- $MPW$ is dependent on the size of $MPS$, $MPT$, and $MPM$
#### MPS
- **Country's attitude to thrift**
	- Americans have a higher level of consumerism, while Asians regard savings as a virtue
	- Thus the propensity to save in American households is lower than Asian households
- **Social security system**
	- Some countries have a higher savings rate because their governments do not provide a strong social safety net (e.g. free healthcare) for its citizens
	- Citizens are then compelled to put aside more savings to prepare for retirement and old age expenditure
- **Government policy**
	- Singapore has the highest savings rate int he world due to compulsory savings in the form of CPF contributions
- **Distribution of income**
	- Higher income groups have higher MPS than lower income groups, thus a more inequitable distribution of income increases MPS 
#### MPT
- A country with a  higher tax rate will have a higher MPT and a smaller multiplier size
#### MPM
- This is largely affected by a country's factor endowment
- Due to a lack of natural resources, Singapore has to import most of her consumer goods and industrial raw materials
- Its MPM is higher and it will have a smaller multiplier value
### Extent of multiplier
#### Leakages
- The size of the multiplier is dependent on the size of $MPW$
- With a higher MPW, more of the increase in income is leaked out and less is spent on induced consumption of domestically produced goods and services
- This reduces the rounds of spending and hence the overall increase in national income will be smaller
#### Lack of spare capacity
- The multiplier effect can only generate increases in real income, employment, and output only if there is spare capacity
- Once an economy reaches full employment, any further increases in expenditure will only increase nominal national income
- I.e. inflation will set in and the GPL rises instead of real output
#### Structural rigidities
- Even if there is spare capacity, the multiplier effect can be limited due to the presence of structural bottlenecks
- E.g. Lack of certain types of resources like skilled labor, fixed capital, enterprise
- When there are insufficient resources for production, the increase in real national output at each round of the multiplier process may be limited
#### Time lag
- It make time for the multiplier to work and in the real world, this can me several weeks or months between each round of spending to happen
## Aggregate supply
- The aggregate supply curve shows the level of domestic output that firms collectively desire to produce at different price levels
### Why is the AS curve like that? 
- On the horizontal range of the AS curve, there is spare capacity
	- Firms do not need to resort to inefficient combinations of factors of production which will drive up the unit cost of production
	- They are thus willing to increase output at the same GPL
- Over the upward sloping range, as firms increase output, there is resource constraint which will reduce efficiency
	- Firms may use less suitable combinations of factors of production (use less suitable standby machines, or employ less efficient workers)
	- This would cause factor costs to rise more rapidly than total output, causing unit cost of production to rise
	- Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices, causing the AS curve to become steeper
- On the vertical range, the economy is at full emplpyment
	- Output can no longer rise as all resources are fully employed
	- Firms are unable to increase output regardless of increases in the GPL
	- If AD were to rise, only the GPL would increase with no change in real output
## Causes of shifts in short-run AS
- These factors affect the unit cost of production, but do not affect the country's productive capacity
### Prices of factor inputs
- Increase in the prices of key domestic or imported inputs like crude oil or other raw materials will drive up the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
### Exchange rates
- Depreciation of the exchange rate would cause the price of imported inputs to rise, increasing the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left
### Government policies
#### Indirect tax rates
- An increase in indirect tax rates like GST will increase the unit cost of production, causing a fall in AS, shifting AS to the left
#### Government regulation
- It is expensive for firms to comply with regulations, increasing the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall, shifting AS to the left

## Causes of shifts in long-run AS
- These affect the quantity, quality, and technology of the country's resources, which affects the productive capacity
### Government policies affecting quality of resources
- Government policies pertaining to domestic or foreign direct investment may affect a country's productive capacity
- E.g. Tax incentives, opening more sectors of the economy to attract investment
- This will increase the rate of capital accumulation
- If the rate of capital accumulation is greater than the rate of capital depreciation, capital stock will rise, increasing productive capacity
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
---
- Immigration and foreign labor policies include controlling the inflow of people into the country or immigrants needing to require permission to to work in the work force
- This reduces the number of foreign workers firms can hire, reducing the total labor force, especially with an aging population
- This is becuase the number of people leaving the work force is greater than the number of new entrants to the work force
- The quantity of labor falls, causing long-run AS to fall, shifting it to the left
### Change in the quality of labor input
- An increase in education and training in an economy due to an increase in investment in human capital will increase the skills of its people (Quality of labor increases)
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Change in technology
- Investment in new technology improves capital productivity, increasing potential output for all goods and services
- This is because new technology is more efficient than old technology
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Natural disasters
- Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis can destroy and permanently decrease the capital stock of the country
- This lowers firms ability to produce, lowering productive capacity
- This causes AS to fall, and shift to the left
