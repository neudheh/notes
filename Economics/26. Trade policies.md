## Protectionism
- ==Protectionism is the partial or complete protection of domestic industries form foreign competition in domestic markets using trade barriers==
### Tariffs
- ==Tariffs are taxes levied on products when they cross national boundaries, and can be applied to imports or exports==
- Tariffs are to restrict imports to protect domestic industries from foreign competition, or raise revenue to finance the activities of the government
---
- Assuming a small country that is too small of a buyer of a product in the world to affect the world price if it varies its demand for imports, the country is a price taker
- The foreign industry is willing to supply as large as the small country want to buy at the world price
- The world supply curve is thus horizontal as supply is perfectly price elastic
- As the country is a price taker, the initial price is $P_f$, and domestic production produces $0A$, and the level of imports is $AD$

- After the imposition of the tariff, the market prices rises by the amount of the tariff to $P_t$, as the small country cannot influence the world price, and face horizontal supply line
- At price $P_t$, domestic production increases to $0B$, while imports are reduced to $BC$
- Consumer surplus falls to $P_tXY$, and domestic producers supply increases to area $1 + 5$
- Consumer surplus has fallen by area $1+2+3+4$, while producer surplus rises by area $1$
- The tax revenue collected by the government is equal to area $3$ (Tax x Number of units imported)
- Area 2 gives the welfare loss due to the increase in domestic production, as domestic producers are more inefficient than foreign producers, leading to wastage of resources
- Area 4 gives the surplus that is lost by consumers due to reduction in overall consumption
- Units $C-D$ could have been acquired at a lower cost and generate high value of consumer surplus ($P_t-P_f$), but they are not bought
- The tariff has denied consumers the opportunity to consume these quantities
- Thus, area 2 and 4 is the total welfare loss, due to domestic overproduction and domestic under consumption of the good
- The tariff has raised the prices of imports, reducing imports and increasing domestic production, protecting the domestic industry from foreign competition
- If the tariff is imposed on a good that is used as an import in other factors, this will drive up the unit cost of production, causing national output and employment to fall
### Quotas
- ==A quota is a limit to the quantity of a good that can be traded, and can be imposed on imports or exports==
- An import quota refers to a direct restriction on the quantity of a goods that may be imported during a given time period
- They are usually imposed when the government wishes to reduce imports and tariffs are ineffective due to a price inelastic demand
- The government distributed exactly the same number of permits of the number of units of the goods that may be imported under the quota
- Importers would need to obtain a licence or permit for each good they bring into the country

- Assuming a small country that is too small of a buyer of a product in the world to affect the world price if it varies its demand for imports, the country is a price taker
- The foreign industry is willing to supply as large as the small country want to buy at the world price
- The world supply curve is thus horizontal as supply is perfectly price elastic
- Initially, consumers pay the world price for this good and $AD$ units are imported
- Assuming the quota only allows the same level of imports that enter under the tariffs $BC$ units, supply  of the good is represented by $Sd\ with\ import\ quota$
- Equilibrium occurs at point $y$
- With the quota, domestic price rises above the world price $P_t$, where $DD$ cuts $Sd\ with\ import\ quota$
- Domestic production rises from $A$ to $B$, benefitting domestic firms as they can earn more revenue
- Imports fall from $C$ to $B$
- Consumers pay a higher price and total quantity falls form $D$ to $C$
- Governments do not collect any tax revenue
---
- Governments can also impose an export quota, which is a restriction of the quantity of a goods that may be exported during a time period
- This is to protect domestic firms from temporary shortages of certain materials (export quota keeps the price of the good low for domestic users)
- It can also be a way to moderate world prices of specific commodities
### Subsidies
- Subsidies can be paid to producers to reduce their marginal costs and therefore prices
- It will enable less efficient producers to be more cost competitive against more efficient foreign producers
- Domestic/ Import subsidies are given to domestic producers of import-competing goods to help them compete with cheaper foreign imports
- Export subsides are made to domestic producers who sell aboard so that exports will be more price competitive in foreign markets
### Voluntary export restraints
- VERs are agreements between countries when the importing country persuades exporters to voluntarily restrain exports
- They are signed in face of threatened action by the importer and may be regarded as forced upon the exporter in most cases
- It is basically a quota, where the exporting country is obliged to limit export from the country to an agreed quota
### Exchange control
- To import goods, payments must be made using the supplier's currency
- By limiting the availability of such foreign currency to importers, citizens travelling aboard, and investors, a country can impose a limit on the value and quantity of imports
### Health and safety regulation
- Health and safety regulations are imposed on agriculture and foodstuff to protect public safety and health
- But, these are also often used as an excuse for refusing permit for the import of certain goods, or to make the importing process cumbersome and expensive
## Reasons for protectionism
### Stimulate economic growth during a recession
- Trade restrictions may be used in times of recession to create economic growth and jobs in the domestic economy
- Import tariffs will cause households to switch from imports to domestic goods, causing AD to rise, generating economic growth and lowering unemployment
- But, such a policy is seen as a beggar thy neighbour policy, as it causes trading partners to suffer a loss in export revenue, hence reducing their national output and income
- This can result in a fall in demand for the exports of the domestic economy, causing AD to fall, leading to a fall in national output and income
- It offsets the initial gains in employment
- It can also invite retaliation form trading partners with similar restrictions, resulting in a loss of export demand for both countries
- Both countries will suffer a contraction in their economy as trade levels shrink
### Reduce structural unemployment
- When a country is open to trade, some of its industries will go into decline
- Import competing industries that have a comparative disadvantage will face falling demand, as resident turn to relatively cheaper imports
- They will lay off workers, resulting in structural unemployment, as the retrenched do not have skills needed to join the expanding exporting sectors
- Hence, restrictions on imports can help slow down the decline of the industry, providing time for labour to be retrained and re-channeled to other growing industries
- This can help to reduce structural unemployment
- But, this can unnecessarily slow down the restructuring process, depriving expanding industries of resources
- Hence, this only makes sense in the short-run as labour is immobile in the short run, and should only be a temporary measure
### Reduce income inequality
- Openness to trade result in rising income inequality in a country
- Workers in import-competing sectors will face falling wage rates and may be laid off as demand is falling due to resident turning towards relatively cheaper imports
- Workers in export-competing sectors will see rising wage rates as demand is rising due to increased exports
- To reduce the rise in income inequality, governments protect the import sectors through tariffs and non-tariff barriers on imports
- But, there are other measures to address this problem such as income redistribution
### Develop infant industries
- There may be industries in a country that are in their infancy which have a potential comparative advantage
- The industry is too small and has yet to gain economies of scale
- Without protection, these industries will not survive against competition form aboard
- Hence, with protection form foreign competition, they can expand and become more efficient
- Once, they have a comparative advantage, the protection can be removed when they are able to compete internationally
- But, protectionism may cause such industries to become complacent and remain internationally uncompetitive and inefficient
- Once protection is given, it is hard to remove, as vested interests are created, and the industry would fight strongly against the removal of trade barriers
- The government might be unable to remove it, as it can be politically damaging, if they receive funding form firms in such industries, or it results in structural unemployment
- Governments also fail to identify the right industry to protect, given the dynamic and unpredictable nature of the world
### Correct a trade deficit
- Protectionist measures may help a country to resolve a BOT deficit
- By imposing tariffs or quotas on imports, import expenditure will fall and correct the trade deficit
- But, this is only short-term and will not solve the underlying problems leading to the trade deficit (e.g. poor quality of exports)
- Trading partners may also retaliate by increasing or setting up their own import barriers, resulting in a fall in exports, offsetting the intended aim of correcting the BOT deficit
### Protect the environment
- To prevent or slow down the environmental damage caused by production, trade barriers are put in place so that countries responsible for pollution will reduce production
- A developing nation will fail to regulate carbon emissions, leading to negative externalities due to the climate change it creates
- A tariff on carbon-emitting products will help to reduce environmental damage
- But, trade is not the source of the problem, and so limiting trade through protectionism will not solve the root cause
- Limiting the number of raw materials that countries can extract might hamper economic growth
### Counter dumping and other anti-competitive activities
- Anti-dumping duties can be imposed on heavily subsidised imports to bring their prices to be more in line with domestic prices
- Dumping does not reflect comparative advantage and may damage domestic industries that would be importer in the long run
- Hence, it is necessary to protect domestic industries and prevent domestic firms form being wiped out by unfair competition
## Methods of cooperation
- A free trade agreement (FTA) are trade blocs where member countries that have abolished all trade barriers among themselves, but maintain their individual tariffs against the world
- They also allow freer mobility of capital flow and labour
- A customs union is like a free trade area, but members must also adopt common external tariffs and quotas with non member countries
- A common market is where member countries operate as a single market
- There are no tariffs and quotas among member countries, and there are common external tariffs and quotas
- There is free movement of labour, capital, materials, and goods and services
- There is a common system of tax
- There is a common system of laws and regulation regarding production, employment and trade
- There is  absence of special treatment by remember governments over their own domestic industries
