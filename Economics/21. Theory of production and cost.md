## Economic cost of production
- Explicit costs refer to actual monetary payments paid to owners of FOPs for the use of FOPs not owned by the firm
- E.g. Raw materials, wages, rent
- Implicit costs refer to costs of using FOPs that doesn't involve direct payment to another party (i.e. opportunity cost of using FOP that the firm already owns)
## Production and costs in the short run
- Fixed costs are costs that do not vary with the level of output of the firm (E.g. Rent)
- These costs will still be incurred even if the firm temporarily shuts down and stops production
- Variable costs are costs that vary positively with the level of output (E.g. raw materials)
- These costs will be zero if the firms ceases production
- Total cost = Total Fixed Cost  + Total Variable cost
- Marginal cost is the addition to total cost from an additional variable output
- Average total cost is the total cost per unit output
- Average variable cost is the total variable cost per unit output
- Averaged fixed cost is the fixed cost per unit output
### The cost curves
![[the cost curves.png]]
- The marginal cost (MC) curve is U shaped that initially declines until it reaches a minimum then rises
	- The rising portion can be explained by using the law of diminishing marginal returns
	- As additional units of a variable factor are added to the fixed factor, the resulting addition to total output will eventually decline
	- The variable factor (e.g. labor) is hired at a fixed unit
	- If extra units of a variable factor of production, bought at a fixed unit price, result in increasing quantities of additional (marginal) output
	- However, once diminishing returns to labor starts to set in at the minimum, it will take more workers to make each extra unit of output, and marginal cost will rise
	- Each worker now adds more to total cost than total output, causing total cost to rise
- Average total cost (ATC) is the cost per unit output, which is a U-shaped curve that initially declines until it reaches at minimum and rises thereafter
	- MC curve must cut the ATC curve at the minimum point
	- If MC is less than ATC, ATC must be falling as if the additional unit of output costs less than the average, the average will be falling
	- If MC is greater than ATC, ATC must be rising as if the additional unit of output costs more than the average, the average will be rising
## Production and costs in the long run
- The long run refers to the time period where all factors used in the production process are variable
- In the long run, the firm is able to change its scale of production, meaning it can change all units of its factors of production by the same proportion
- The firm will be considered increasing its scale of production, and this decision allows it to reap internal economies of scale
- Internal economies of scale (EOS) refers to a decrease in a firm's unit cost of production when the scale of production increases
- However, when a firm expands beyond a certain size, it could experience internal diseconomies of scale (dis-EOS), which could cause unit cost to rise as output expands
- As an industry grows in size, it could lead to external EOS for all of its member firms, allowing a firm, regardless of size to enjoy lower unit cost when the industry expands
- When the industry expands beyond a certain size, firms in the industry may experience external dis-EOS instead
- Both EOS and dis-EOS apply only to the long run where all inputs are variable
### Reasons for internal EOS
#### Increased productivity
- As a firm expands, there is room for increased specialization of capital and labor, which leads to a more efficient organization of the production process, lowering unit cost
- E.g. Workers in a manufacturing firm can be deployed to perform specific tasks like transporting, assembling, testing, quality control, etc.
- As a worker repeatedly performs a specific task, he specialized in doing what he is assigned to and becomes better at it, raising his labor productivity
- Assuming that the wage paid to the workers does not change, the wage of the workers is spread over a larger output, resulting in greater productivity, lowering unit costs
- Larger firms care able to afford specialized departments and people doing specific administrative operations
- The greater specialization in the relevant areas of expertise greatly results in greater productivity, lowering unit costs
#### Spreading out of fixed costs
- Some capital equipment greatly improve efficiency, but they require a huge capital outlay and are indivisible, meaning they are not available in smaller units
- For example, printing presses only come in specific and large sizes and are very expensive
- The printing firm will only acquire the machine if there is a large enough output such that the costs of acquiring these machines can be distributed over a larger output
- This brings unit costs down
- Network infrastructure also has high start up costs, hence the more users there are, the lower the long run average costs
- A firm will only incur a lump-sum spending on an advertising campaign, but the cost can be spread over a larger volume of output for a wider firm, leading to a fall in average cost
- Larger firms also produce a variety of products
- Advertising for one product would indirectly promote their other products because of common branding, lowering average cost
#### Increased dimension
- With the expansion of the scale of production, the cost increases less than proportionately, leading to a fall in unit costs
- For example, if the size of a tanker is doubled, it may need less than 8 times the amount of resources to build and operate, but it can store 8 times as much cargo
- This causes per unit cost to fall
#### Greater buying power
- Firms have higher bargaining power when they negotiate prices with their suppliers
- They are able to get bulk discounts as they place large orders, leading to lower unit costs
- Firms are also able to obtain bank loans to finance their business operations at a lower interest rate as big firms are more stable and less risky
- They also can easily raise funds by easily publicly issuing shares and bonds
### Reasons for internal dis-EOS
#### Difficulties in communication and coordination
- As the size of a firm increases, many specialized departments are created, giving rise to the problems of coordination 
- This is because these departments may have conflicting objectives
- Problems of control both within and between departments will arise because of the difficulties in monitoring all the different operations
- There may be increased red tape and paperwork, hence higher costs and greater inefficiency
- Administrative costs may arise and make the firms slower in responding to changes in market conditions
- Productivity may drop, increasing unit cost of production
#### Morale
- If specialization is carried out to an extreme extent, doing the same thing all the time can lead to boredom and a fall in labor productivity, hence higher unit cost
- Decline in labor relations may arise due to an increased hierarchical structure
- Workers become less motivated as they are less empowered to make independent decisions
- Productivity may drop, increasing unit cost of production
### Shape of the LRAC curve
- As a firm increases production, it is able to reduce its unit costs of production as it is reaping internal EOS
- However, once it expands beyond a certain point, the firm starts to suffer internal dis-EOS
- This gives rise to the U-shaped long run average cost curve
- All points on the curve are productive efficient
- The output level at which the LRAC first reaches its minimum is at the minimum efficient scale
- Beyond this, the firms ceases to enjoy internal EOS
![[LRAC curve.png]]
#### Small firms
- If the MES is achieved at relatively low levels of output, then the firm is small, as small firms have limited EOS due to the nature of the production
#### Large firms
- If the MES is achieved at relatively high levels of output, firms tend to be large, as these firms are able to reap large EOS
- Their size allows them to use large complex machinery or specialization that are most cost efficient
#### Varying cost
- If the LRAC is at its minimum over a range of output, then it is of varying sizes
- MES is achieved at $Q_3$ but is at its minimum up to $Q_4$
![[LRAC curves for each firm.png]]
- The MES corresponds to a firms size
- If a firm is not producing at MES, its unit costs may be too high compared to its competitors who are producing at MES
- Such firms may not be able to compete with their lower cost competitors and will be driven out of business
- Firms producing near or at MES have a better chance of survival in the long run
### Reasons for external EOS
#### Outsourcing parts of production process
- As an industry grows, greater specialization in the form of outsourcing of the production of intermediate components may occur
- Firms may not need to undertake the production of every single component, and can instead be bought more cheaply from supporting firms
- These supporting firms are more specialized at producing such components and can experience internal EOS as they are producing for many other firms as well
- This lowers the unit cost of production
- The costs of transport and communication have fallen drastically, making it possible for companies to split up their production lines into different production facilities
- Each stage of production occurs not just in a separate factory, but a separate country too
- This is facilitated by the international trading system and the creation of global supply chains
#### Tap on common resources
- Some industries are concentrated within a specific geographical area, and firms in this area and reap benefits
- Google and Apple are in Silicon valley, causing training schools providing relevant courses to establish themselves in the region to develop skilled workers
- This ensures that there is a pool of skilled workers readily available, allowing firms to cut down on training costs
- Silicon valley has also become a hotspot for IT related industries, and skilled workers are attracted to the area, and firms will spend less searching for skilled labor
- This cuts down on labor search costs
- As an industry grows and becomes more significant, independent research centers like universities may focus more of their R&D on the industry
- Unit costs would be lowered for all firms as the R&D costs are spread out among all the firms involved in the research
- There is also greater scope for mutual cooperation in R&D to develop common industry standards so that there would be lesser duplication
### Reasons for external dis-EOS
#### Increased competition
- There would be increased competition among the firms for factors of production, leading to the rising prices of inputs
- Firms competing for the same factor of production, such as labor that has a similar skillset, would have to offer higher wages to attract workers
- This rises the factor prices, leading to increased unit costs of production
#### Overutilization of common infrastructure
- Overutilization of infrastructure like roads leading to and within the industrial area can lead to traffic congestion, increasing transport costs
- The firm has to find means to solve or mitigate the new problems, increasing unit costs of production
### Shifting the LRAC curve
- External EOS causes a downward shift of the firms LRAC curve from $LRAC$ to $LRAC'$
- External dis-EOS causes an upward shift of the firms LRAC curve from $LRAC$ to $LRAC''$
