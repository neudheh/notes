## Unemployment
- The unemployment rate is given by $$Unemployment\ rate = \frac{No.\ of\ unemployed}{Labour\ Force} \times 100\%$$
- ==The unemployed are people who are of working age who are without work, but are willing and able to work==
- ==They are actively seeking employment  or waiting to take up an appointment==
- In Singapore, the labour force comprises of all those aged 15 (working age) and above who are willing and able to work and are either employed or actively seeking employment
- They are known as the economically active group
- This does not include students, housewives, retirees, prisoners and the disabled
## Factors affecting the rate of unemployment
### Size of the labour force
- The labour force can grow because of an increase in the working age population
- This can increase due to a rise in the birth rate, a fall in the death rate, or a rise in immigration
- An influx of fresh graduates or entrants to the labour market can also result in growth of the labour force
- The labour force can also grow due to the labour force participation rate, given by $$Labour\ force\ participation\ rate = \frac{Labour Force}{Working\ age\ population \times 100 \%}$$
### Composition of the labour force
- The composition of the labour force looks at the educational and skill qualifications of the workforce
- If workers posses skills that are no longer in demand by the economy, it will also result in unemployment
### Labour productivity
- Labour productivity is the output produced by man hour
- This is influenced by the education level and the state of technology
- Assuming an economy-wide increase in productivity, the higher productivity rate makes it attractive for firms to increase employment, increasing demand for labour, reducing unemployment
## Demand-deficient (cyclical) unemployment
- ==Demand-deficient unemployment is caused by a fall in aggregate demand==
- It is also called cyclical unemployment as it fluctuates with the business cycle
- During a recession, cyclical unemployment is higher as demand for labour falls due to weaker or lower aggregate demand
- During an economic boom, cyclical unemployment is  lower as demand for labour rises due to stronger or higher aggregate demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Assume the economy is initially producing at $Y_f$
>- When there is a fall in AD (state the cause), firms will see a rise in inventories and would cut back production
>- This reduces their demand for factors of production like labour, as labour is a essential factor of production and is a derived demand
>- This fall in national income will trigger cuts in spending on domestically produced goods and services due to the multiplier effect
>- Assuming the economy was initially performing at full employment, the fall in $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ will result in the equilibrium level of output falling to $Y_1$
>- Since the full employment level is at $Y_f$, the output gap $Y_f - Y_1$ reflects a difference between the actual output and the potential national output
>- This gap also indicate the presence of demand deficient unemployment
>

>- Firms will cut back on production as a result of the fall in AD, and would cut back on the amount of labour they employ, as labour is a derived demand
>- Firms will cut back on labour employed during a recessions, shifting demand for labour from $D_{L1} to D_{L2}$
>- But, wages did not fall down to $W_2$ as wages are "sticky" downwards
>- Hence, $L_1 - L_2$ represents the demand deficient unemployment level at $W_1$, and the wage rate is unable to clear the surplus
>

>[!NOTE]
>Wages are sticky downwards due to
>- Wage contracts, where employees have wages specified in their medium-term employment contracts that cannot be renegotiated immediately, because some workers are protected by trade unions
>- Employees morale, as pay cuts may affect everyones morale, and by not cutting wages of those who are not laid off, they become more productive than before
>- Fear of the best people leaving, as if employees cut salaries across the board, the better workers would feel disgruntled and will leave to find work elsewhere

### Natural rate of unemployment
- Full employment does not mean zero unemployment, it just means there is no cyclical unemployment
- At the equilibrium real wage rate, demand for labour is equal to the supply of labour
- But, there are some people who are looking for a new job in between jobs, or some that are "holding out", hoping to find better jobs
- Therefore at full employment, there can be some unemployment in for form of frictional and structural unemployment
- This is known as the natural rate of unemployment, the unemployment that would exist even without cyclical unemployment
## Structural unemployment
- ==Structural unemployment is caused by structural changes in the economy and occupational immobility ==
- This results in some workers being unemployed for very long periods of time because they cannot find jobs that require their particular skills
- ==There is a mismatch of skills between the unemployed and the skills required by producers==
### Changes in the method of production
- New technology and techniques of production often allow the same level of output to be produced with fewer workers
- But, this results in certain jobs and skills becoming obsolete, displacing redundant workers
- It can create new jobs, but many of the unemployed are unable to fill these new posts as their old skills may no longer be applicable
- Occupational immobility of labour is where existing skills are no longer required, and those retrenched do not possess the skills that are in demand to take up jobs in other sectors in the economy
### Globalisation
- Labour-intensive industries need low-skilled cheap labour
- These industries especially in developed countries ,which used to have comparative advantage in production, can no longer compete effectively with developing countries due to rising labour costs
- Additionally, in response to rising globalisation, some countries may restructure their economy to develop new industries to stay competitive
- Worker working in these declining/ sunset industries may not ave the relevant skills to move on to these sunrise industries and will become unemployed
### Change in a pattern of demand
- Some industries experience declining demand
- This can be due to a change in consumer tastes, where certain goods may go out of fashion, or due to competition form other industries, leading to unemployment
## Frictional unemployment
- ==Frictional unemployment occurs when workers leave their jobs or leave school and are unemployed for a period of time while they are searching for a job==
- This occurs it takes time for people who have left their previous jobs or have just entered the labour force to find jobs
- Employers may continue searching, hoping to find a better-qualified candidate for the job
- The unemployed may also not take the first job they are offered, and continue searching hoping that they will receive a better job offer
- They could take the first, job, but it might not make the best use of his skills, resulting in lower productivity
- It is probably better for them to take some time to find the right job so that the economy's resources are more efficiently allocated and better utilised
### Imperfect information
- Workers are not fully informed of what jobs are available, and what they entail
- Employers are not fully informed by what labour is available
- Thus, both workers and employers have to search; workers searching for the right jobs and employers searching for the right labour
### Incentive problems
- Some people looking for a new jobs may not be employed if they believe that the tax and benefit system will reduce the net increase in income from taking work
- E.g. disincentive to work due to high income tax rates and high unemployment benefits
## Consequences
### Households
- Loss of income to the unemployed  lowers purchasing power and hence consumption of goods and services, which lowers material standard of living
- Rising unemployment leads to worries about possible loss of income sources, causing increased levels of anxiety, lowering non-material standard of living
- When rising unemployment leads to increase in crime rates, sense of peace of mind is diminished which lowers non-material living standards 
### Firms
- Lower consumption due to loss of income or worsening consumer confidence (if unemployment is prolonged) will lead to lower production and sales of goods and services, resulting in lower revenue for firms
### Government
- Loss of tax revenue as the unemployed do not pay income tax and receipts
- Other forms of tax receipts such as GST will decrease as the unemployed will also spend less
- Incurs administrating costs associated with running of welfare offices
- The government expenditure increases as more unemployed benefits are given out too
- With falling tax revenue and rising government expenditure, the governments budget balance worsens
- If it was already in deficit, it would lead to a rising budget deficit and rising government debt as they would have to borrow more to finance the debt
### Economy
- There is productive inefficiency in terms of wasted, unused labour resources
- The existence of idle resources means that the economy will be producing at a point inside the PPC, preventing society's welfare from being maximised
- Rising unemployment leads to poor business confidence, resulting in a fall in investments by firms as the expected rate of returns are likely to be low
- This would cause AD to fall, creating a downward multiplier effect on the county's GDP
- The fall in investment slows down potential growth
- There is a slowdown in the growth of capital stock, assuming the rate of capital accumulation is greater than the rate of capital depreciation.
- High prolonged unemployment may cause other costs to societies through protests and strikes, begging, juvenile delinquency and crimes
- THis wuld lead to a fall in tourism and profits of businesses
