## Macroeconomic goals
- Countries want to achieve these 4 macroeconomic goals in the long term
	1. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth
	2. Full employment
	3. Price stability
	4. Favorable balance of trade (BOT) position
## The circular flow of income
### 2-sector (closed) economy with no government
- There are only 2 decision makers, households and firms
- Households own all factors of production, and are consumers of goods and and services produced by firms
- Firms employ labor other factors of production to generate output

- Firms, in order to produce goods and services, would hire factors of production (land, labor, capital, enterprise) from households, with each factor of production generating their respective income payments (wages, rent, interest, and profits)
- Households provide factor services to firms and in turn spend their income on the purchase of goods and services on goods and services produced by firms
- Thus, there is a circular flow of income
- In a simple two-sector closed economy consisting of only firms and households, where there are no savings, all consumption expenditure ($C$) are paid back to households as income ($Y$) for use of their factors of production
- Hence, $C = Y$
- This process forms the circular flow of income where households earn income from firms and firms obtain income from households for the output bought and consumed
- It can also be seen that total expenditure is equal to total income
### 4-sector (open) economy with government
- A 4-sector open economy consists of firms, households, the foreign sector, and the government, and is where savings take place
- Not all income earned by households is spent on domestically produced goods and services

#### Withdrawals
- Withdrawals ($W$) from the circular flow of income are household's income that is not passed on to domestic firms through spending on goods and services produced by these domestic firms
- Withdrawals include savings ($S$), taxes ($T$), and import expenditure ($M$)
- Households will use a major portion of their income to purchase consumers goods and services from domestic firms
- But, a portion of it will be leaked out in the form of savings, some of it will be taxed by the government and some of it will be used to purchase imports in an open economy
#### Injections
- Injections ($J$) into the circular flow of income are income receipts by domestic firms that do not arise through household's spending
- Income can reenter the circular flow in the form of injections
- Injections include investment expenditure ($I$), government expenditure ($G$) and export revenue ($X$)
- Savings in banks can be loaned out to finance capital goods (investment expenditure), tax revenue can be sued to fund government expenditure, and the home country's exports can be bought by foreigners, generating export revenue for domestic firms
#### Equilibrium in the circular flow
- Equilibrium is achieved when total injects is equal to total withdrawals
$$J=W$$
$$I+G+X=S+T+M$$
- When there is changes in either injections or withdrawals such that total injections is no longer equal to total withdrawals, firms will adjust their output and hence the country's GDP level changes
- In this circular flow of income model, the general price level is assumed to be constant
- If $W > J$, national income will contract
	- The planned expenditure of the economy is not enough to buy up all the goods and services that the firms had produced
	- Firms will be faced with mounting stocks of unsold goods, and will cut back on output
	- This will reduce the number of factors of production they employ, and reduce the income of households
	- As income falls, there will be lesser withdrawals from the economy, causing $W$ to fall until $W=J$ again
- If $J > W$, national income will expand
	- The planned expenditure of the economy will be greater than the output of firms
	- Firms will expand output by hiring more factors of production, to replenish depleting stocks and raise the level of household's income
	- As income rises, there will be more withdrawals from the economy, causing $W$ to rise again until $W=J$ again
