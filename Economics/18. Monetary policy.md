- ==Monetary policy is the process where the central bank uses interest rate or exchange rates as alternative instruments to achieve the macroeconomic goals of the country==
- Monetary policy is an aggregate demand tool where the central bank uses money supply, interest rate, or exchange rate to influence the aggregate demand
## Interest rate monetary policy
- In interest rate centred monetary policy, the central bank changes the interest rate directly, or indirectly by changing the money supply
- Because of the difficultly of controlling money supply and the effects of monetary policy operate mainly via the interest rate, central banks aim to use/ target interest rate instead
### Expansionary monetary policy
- Expansionary monetary policy is the lowering of interest rate or increasing of monetary supply to boost AD
- This is used to stimulate the economy and lower demand-deficient unemployment during a recession, or demand-side deflation
- With a lower interest rate, the cost of borrowing falls, and households are incentivised to purchase consumer durables such as cars through loans
- Consumers will also receive lower returns on their savings from banks, lowering the opportunity cost of consumption
- Hence, consumption expenditure $C$ rises
- Also, with a fall in the cost of borrowing, firms will undertake new investments
- The marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of returns, is now lower than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- Some investment projects which were previously unprofitable that were previously not profitable are now profitable
- Thus, investment expenditure $I$ rises
![[expansionary fiscal policy.png]]
- Assuming the economy is below full employment, AD rises from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- There will be an unplanned fall in inventories, and firms will increase production by hiring more FOPs
- Household's income will increase and they will spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services, increasing induced consumption
- AD will rise further
- This leads to further increases in production and more FOPs being hired, resulting in another cycle of spending, until total withdrawals equal total injections
- There will be a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- There is actual growth and a fall in demand-deficient unemployment
### Contractionary monetary policy
- ==A contractionary monetary policy is where interest rates are raised or money supply is reduced to reduce AD==
- This is done to reduce inflationary pressures
- With a higher interest rate, the cost of borrowing rises
- For firms, the marginal benefit of investing, the expected rate of return, is now lesser than the marginal cost of investing, the interest rate
- Some investments opportunities that were previously profitable are now unprofitable
- Hence, investment expenditure $I$ decreases
- With higher interest rates, the cost of borrowing rises and households are disincentivised in purchasing consumer durables like cars through loans
- Consumers will receive higher returns to their savings from banks, increasing the opportunity cost of consumption
- Hence, consumption expenditure $C$ decreases
![[demand side deflation.png]]
- AD falls, causing AD to shift from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- Firms will see an unplanned rise in inventories, and will reduce production by hiring lesser FOPs
- Households will receive lesser income, and they will spend lesser of it on domestic goods and services, lowering induced consumption
- AD will fall further
- Firms will further reduce production and employ lesser FOPs, resulting in another fall in spending, until total injections equal total withdrawals
- There will be a multiplied fall in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_3$
- The rise in unemployment means firms are better able to get the resources that they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations
- This reduces the cost of production, and there will be lesser inflationary pressure, causing price level to drop form $P_1$ to $P_3$
---
- With a rise in interest rates, AD would fall
- If the fall in AD reduces national output/ income (if the economy was initially below full employment), the fall in national income will reduce import expenditure
- The fall in GPL would improve the price competitiveness of exports, and there is a rise in quantity demand of exports
- There is a rise in total export revenue if demand for exports is price elastic
- The fall in export revenue from the fall in price is lesser than the rise in export revenue due to the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded
- Local goods and services are also cheaper than imports, causing a rise in demand for local goods and services, reducing import expenditure
- This will improve the BOT, and improve the current account as BOT is the largest component in the current account
- A rise in interest rates would also result in hot money inflows, improving the capital and financial account
## Evaluation of monetary policy
### Interest rate sensitivity of consumption on investment expenditure
- During a recession, investment demand may not be sensitive to a fall in interest rates
- Firms are not likely to borrow to invest if they are already facing excess capacity, and when the expected rate of investment is low due to poor business outlook
- Hence if demand for investment is interest rate inelastic, a fall in interest rate will be met with a less than proportionate rise in investments
- Thus, a fall in interest rate would not be as effective in stimulating $I$ and hence AD
- Consumption is also likely to be interest insensitive in times of recession
- Households facing the prospect of retrenchments and falling incomes are unlikely to be enticed by lower interest rate to borrow for consumption
- Thus, during a recession, $C$ and $I$ would be unresponsive to interest rate 
- Expansionary monetary policy may not be effective in promoting economic growth
- On the other hand, during demand-pull inflation, a rise in interest rates may not be successful in discouraging consumption or investment
- This is because households and firms may have a positive outlook of the economy, and firms will still invest even if interest rate rises, and borrowing is more expensive
- Thus, $C$ and $I$ would be unresponsive to a rise in interest rate
- The rise in AD may not be curtailed and there may be a limited impact in reducing demand-pull inflation
### Size of multiplier
- In stimulating economic growth and employment, the effectiveness of the monetary policy depends on the size of the multiplier
- A country with a high $MPC_D$ or low $MPW$ will have a large multiplier
- Monetary policy will be effective in raising output and employment due to the lower propensity to withdraw from the circular flow of income
- Conversely, a country with a high $MPM$, a high $MPS$, or high $MPT$ would have a smaller multiplier
- It will be difficult for monetary policy to raise output and employment to the desired level due to higher propensity to withdraw from the circular flow of income
### Size of domestic sector
- The size of the domestic market out of GDP affect the extent of impact of interest rate policy
- If consumption and domestic investments are small relative to the export sector, interest rate policy that increasing these components might not have much impact on the country
- Singapore has a small domestic consumption and investment as a proportion of her GDP, as she has a small population and an open economy
- If Singapore uses expansionary interest rate centred monetary policy to boost AD to increase national income, the extent of the rise in AD might not be significant
- This limits the effectiveness of interest rate policy to affect AD and hence the goals of full employment or general price stability
- Such a policy would have a greater impact on an economy that has a larger domestic market like the US
### Liquidity trap
- This is a situation which occurs because market interest rate has already reached its lowest possible level and cannot fall any further
- As the market interest rate cannot fall any lower, $C$ and $I$ cannot increase
- Japan has been maintaining a close to zero interest rate for years, but consumers are not willing to spend and firms are not willing to invest
### Exchange rate system
- Under a managed float exchange system, in order to maintain the exchange rate, the bank loses control of its monetary supply
- Using a monetary policy that is focused on interest rates to influence aggregate demand is not possible
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- For example, to address demand-pull inflation, the central bank may raise interest rates
>- This rise in interest rates will result in hot money inflows, and cause demand for the domestic currency to rise
>- This puts upward pressure on the exchange rate
>- To prevent the currency from appreciating above the upper limit in a managed float exchange rate system, the central bank will sell domestic currency in the forex market
>- Once the foreigners buy the newly created currency and spend it on domestic goods and services, the money ends up in bank accounts in the local banking system
>- This will increase money supply and lower interest rates, negating the effects of the original intended monetary policy
- On the other hand, under a floating exchange rate system, monetary policy can help the economy to recover through adjustments in external demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Lowering the interest rates will result in hot money outflows, increasing supply of the currency in the forex market
>- This will cause the currency to depreciate, and this will decrease the price of exports in foreign markets, and the price of imports in domestic currency
>- This will encourage exports and dampen imports
>- Net exports rises, assuming Marshall-Lerner condition, increasing AD and hence there will be real GDP growth and falling demand deficient unemployment
>- Conversely, when the economy is overheated, increasing the interest rates will result in hot money inflows that will cause the currency to appreciate
>- This will dampen export demand and encourage imports, decreasing AD and adding downward pressure on GPL
## Exchange rate monetary policy
- Foreign exchange rate policy is a policy centred on the management of exchange rate
- Central banks that have adopted a managed float exchange rate system can have a policy with regards to its exchange rate
### Exchange rate depreciation
- A policy of exchange rate depreciation is a downward revision of the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies
- It is a deliberate action by the central bank through selling the local currency in a managed float exchange rate system 
- It aims to switch expenditure away from foreign goods to domestically produced goods 
- It does so by making exports cheaper in terms of foreign currency and import more expensive in terms of local currency
### Exchange rate appreciation
- A policy of exchange rate appreciation is the upward revision of the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies
- The central bank intervenes in the managed float exchange rate system by buying up domestic currency to support the currency at a higher value
- This is to switch expenditure away from domestically produced goods to foreign goods
- This is done so to make export more expensive in terms of foreign currency and imports cheaper in terms of local currency
### Economic growth and employment through depreciation
- When the central bank allows the exchange rate to depreciate, foreigners will find domestic goods and services cheaper
- This will lead to a rise in demand for exports
- Locals will switch from buying imports to the relatively cheaper domestically produced good and services
- $(X-M)$ will rise if the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, causing a rise in AD
- Depreciation of the currency can also attract hot money inflows to buy financial assets as they are relatively cheaper for foreigners
- There would be a rise in loanable funds, lowering the interest rate, increasing local investments
- Depreciation may also attract FDI as asset prices are cheaper, making local investment opportunities more profitable
- $I$ will rise, causing a rise in AD
*AD adjustment process as explained in expansionary monetary policy*
- With a rise in AD, firms will increase their output and hire more workers, causing a fall in demand-deficient unemployment
#### Limitations
**Imported inflation**
- But, depreciation may cause the price of imported inputs to rise, and with the rise in price of imported inputs, firms will face a rise in their unit cost of production
- This would lead to a fall in AS as the horizontal portion of AS shifts upwards
- Hence, depreciation could decrease real GDP and lead to imported inflation
- This will result in an increase in unemployment
- The rise in prices of imported inputs may also reduce the attractiveness for FDI and discourage long term capital inflows
**Capital flight**
- If depreciation is interpreted as a sign that the central bank cannot support the forex rate, the expectation of future devaluation may cause investors to withdraw their funds
- This would lead to a rise in hot money outflows, decreasing the supply of loanable funds
- The interest rate will rise, lowering local investment
- This will put a contractionary effect on AD, decreasing actual growth
- With lower output produced, firms may cut jobs, increasing unemployment
#### Effects on BOP
**BOT and current account**
- A depreciation of the exchange rate makes exports cheaper in foreign currency, and imports cheaper in local currency
- This would cause foreigners to switch from their home products to the country's exports, and locals to switch from imports to locally produced goods and services
- The increase in demand for exports by the foreigners increases export revenue
- If the demand for imports is price elastic, the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded for imports would lead to a fall in import expenditure
- There would be a rise in import expenditure if demand for imports is price inelastic and this may offset some or all of the rise in export revenue, worsening BOT
- Nevertheless, BOT improves if the Marshall-Lerner condition holds
**Capital account**
- Depreciation of the exchange rate makes a country's assets cheaper in foreign currencies
- If no further depreciation is expected, hot money inflows may be encouraged, as the temporary depreciation makes these assets cheaper, resulting in higher returns
- But, if further depreciation is expected, there may be capital outflow due to deprecation, as the returns from these financial assets is expected to be lower in the future
- Depreciation improves export competitiveness, and attracts long-term capital inflows
- But the impact of long-term capital inflows is uncertain as the stability of the exchange rate is a critical factor for FDI
- If the exchange rate continues to depreciate, the profits earned by the foreign firm will be lower in the future when they convert it back to their home currency
- Additionally, if the country is dependent on imported inputs, the rise in production costs could reduce the attractiveness for FDI
- But, if depreciation results in short-term and long-term capital inflows, BOP deficit could be improved
### Lowering inflation through appreciation
- An exchange rate appreciation makes exports more expensive in terms of foreign currency and would lead to a fall in demand for exports
- It also makes imports cheaper in local currency, and there would be a rise in quantity demanded for exports
- This would cause net export revenue to fall assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds
- Thus, AD falls, cooling down the economy
*AD adjustment process as explained in contractionary monetary policy*
- A fall in the exchange rate would also lower cost-push inflation in the country due to imported inflation
- An exchange rate appreciation will prevent the price of imports from rising in terms of the local currency, keeping imported inflation in check
## Evaluation of exchange rate policy
### Price elasticity of demand for exports and imports
- To improve the trade-balance, the central bank wants a weaker or depreciating exchange rate
- But, this is assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, where $|PED_X + PED_M| >1$
- If the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold, depreciation of a currency would cause $(X-M)$ to fall instead of rise, worsening BOT and negatively affecting growth
- The demand for imports/ exports may be price inelastic in the short term, before becoming more elastic with time
- Foreign markets need time to realise exports are cheaper and change their spending habits, and locals may not immediately know about the increased import prices
- Even if exports are becoming cheaper, firms are contractually bound to continue with existing suppliers for a certain time period before switching to a cheaper one
### Presence of spare capacity in the economy
- Depreciation results in actual growth and rise in employment only if there is spare capacity
- The central bank may allow depreciation of its currency to alleviate the problem of a BOT deficit, increasing AD
- If there is a lack of spare capacity in the economy, demand-pull inflation will result, and the price advantage created by the exchange rate depreciation will be eroded by inflation
### Nature of the economy
- For a small open economy like Singapore, exchange rate depreciation may not be effective in improving a trade deficit
- This is because of the cost-push inflation that results from the depreciation
- When Singapore's exchange rate depreciates, exports become cheaper in terms of foreign currencies, but the price of imported inputs increases
- There will be an increase in the cost of production, which will erode the improved price competitiveness of the exports
- The exchange rate depreciation will also increase the price of imports, adding on to inflationary pressure in the economy
- If workers and trade unions press for higher wages in view of the higher cost of living, it may result in a wage price spiral
- This will reduce the price competitiveness of exports, and import substitution effect that was intended by the depreciation
### Causes and mix of macroeconomic problems
- Depreciation may not address the root causes of the economic problems
- For example, if the BOT deficit is due to the poor quality of a country's exports,  then supply side policies which can improve the quality of exports would be more appropriate
- The mix of macroeconomic problems present is also an important factor to consider
- If a country has both a BOT deficit and demand-deficient unemployment, then exchange rate depreciation may be appropriate, as it improves BOT and increases AD
- But, if the country has both a BOT deficit and inflation, exchange rate depreciation mat not be appropriate as it worsens inflation
### Retaliation by other countries
- When a country depreciates, its trading partners may suffer a fall in their export revenue and face stiff competition form cheaper imports
- They may retaliate by depreciating their currencies, which would offset the intended improvement in export price competitiveness
- Demand for exports may not increase by much, and a currency war may result
