## Balance of payments
- ==The balance of payments (BOP) refers to a statement of all of the international transactions of a country with the rest of the world, over a period of time==
$$Balance\ of\ payments\ (BOP) = Inflows\ of\ currency - Outflows\ of\ currency$$
- In other words, the flows of currency between residents of a country and the rest of the world are recorded in the BOP
- It is made up of the current account, capital and financial account, and the reserve assets
### Current account
- The current account records exports of imports of goods and services, primary income as well as current transfers (secondary income)
#### Payments for exports and import of goods and services
- Exports of goods and services earn income from overseas and are inflows of currency into the country
- Imports of goods and services lead to an expenditure and hence are outflows of currency from the country
- E.g. Tourism, medical treatment, insurance, and banking
- When we take into account both export revenue and import expenditure of goods and services, we get the balance of trade
$$Balance\ of\ trade\ (BOT) = Export\ Revenue - Import\ Expenditure$$
#### Primary income
- Primary income consists of income flows such as wages, rent, interest, and profits flowing into and out of the country
- E.g. US MNCs that have invested in Singapore may send their profits back to the US
- This is recorded as an outflow from Singapore's current account
- Primary income balance is the difference between income received by Singaporeans from other countries, and income paid to foreigners by Singapore
#### Current transfers
- Current transfers are unilateral transfers of money
- Government grants and aid to other countries (e.g. donating money for relief from disasters)
- These will be recorded as outflows from Singapore's current account
### Capital and financial account
- The capital and financial accounts records the international transactions of physical assets (land, buildings, factories) and financial assets (bonds, bank deposits, and loans)
#### Direct investments
- Direct investments include international sales and purchases of fixed assets such as land, buildings, and factories
- Foreign direct investments (FDI) are foreign firms setting up operations in the domestic economy
- These are classified as long term capital flows
- These would typically be affected by long-term factors such as business expectations, government policies and political/ social stability
- They are relatively less liquid (cannot be sold easily/ converted into cash without any loss of value)
>[!NOTE]
>- FDI can ential the b=purchase of new assets of buying existing assets
>- If new assets are bought, there is production of goods and services, hence this would increase I, causing AD to rise
>- If existing assets are bought, there is no production of goods and services, hence there is no effect on AD
#### Portfolio investments
- Portfolio investments are financial assets such as stocks, bonds and other types of financial investment
- These assets are relatively liquid and are classified as sort term capital flows
- E.g. Singaporeans would want to deposit money in banks overseas due to higher interest rates/ expected appreciation of foreign currency, causing an outflow of currency
- Short term capital flows moving to countries with higher interest rates/ expected appreciation of the foreign exchange rate are called "hot money"
### Reserve assets
- Reserves assets are transactions in the official reserves that are held by a country's central bank
- Many central banks conduct international transactions of currency in order to achieve the desired influence on the exchange rate
- Central banks hold foreign reserves, which are in foreign currency, that they can use to buy their country's currency
- They can also use their home country's currency to buy foreign currency
- They also have international transactions with the IMF and other overseas monetary authorities and financial institutions
- Such borrowing and lending of foreign exchange are also recorded under reserve assets
## BOP equilibrium
- A country's BOP position is determined by the flows of currency in both the current account and the capital and financial account
- The BOP is said to be equilibrium when total inflow of currency is greater than total outflow of currency
- The BOP is said to be in disequilibrium if the net inflow of currency is not equal to 0
- If inflow > outflow, there is a BOP surplus
- If outflow > inflow, there is a BOP deficit
- If there is a BOP surplus, the country is accumulating reverses
- If there is a BOP deficit, the country is withdrawing from its reserves to finance the deficit
## Forex
- The foreign exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another in the foreign exchange (forex) market
### Demand for a currency
- Demand for a currency is dependent on foreign demand for local goods and services
- If a Singaporean were to go to Malaysia for a holiday, he will need to pay for the goods and services consumed in Malaysia in Ringgit
- He will have to exchange his Singapore dollars for Malaysian Ringgit, increasing demand for the Ringgit
### Supply of a currency
- Supply of a currency is dependent of a country's demand for foreign goods services and assets
- If a Singaporean were to go to Malaysia for a holiday, he will need to pay for the goods and services consumed in Malaysia in Ringgit
- He will have to exchange his Singapore dollars for Malaysian Ringgit, increasing  supply of Singapore dollars
## Floating exchange rate system
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate is determined by market forces
- The interaction of demand and supply for a currency determine the exchange rate
- There is no government intervention in the foreign exchange market
![[floating exchange rate system.png]]
- The demand for the S$ is downward sloping
- At higher exchange rate, Singapore's goods and services are more expensive in terms of Japanese ¥, causing a fall in quantity demanded for S$
- The supply of the S$ is upward sloping
- At higher exchange rate, Japanese goods and services would be cheaper in terms of S$, causing a rise in quantity supplied for S\$
- Any changes to demand and supply of the currency will cause the exchange rate to change
### Changes in demand 
![[floating exchange rate system change in demand.png]]

- Suppose there has been an increase in demand by the Japanese for Singapore's exports (due to a non-exchange rate factor e.g. rise in income of the Japanese)
- This will result in an increase in demand for the S$ as the Japanese would need S$ to pay for Singapore's exports
- The demand curve shifts from $D$ to $D_1$
- At the current exchange rate of 81¥ per S$, there will be a shortage of S\$, placing upward pressure on the exchange rate
- As the exchange rate appreciates, the quantity demanded for S$ falls
- This will continue until a new equilibrium exchange rate is reached, where $D_1$ intersects S, and exchange rate is 120¥ per S$
- At this exchange rate, the shortage of $S has been eliminated
- Hence, when demand increases, the equilibrium exchange rate rises and the S$ has appreciated against the ¥
### Changes in Supply
![[floating exchange rate system changes in supply.png]]
- If Singaporeans increase their demand for Japanese imports (due to a non-exchange rate factor e.g. rise in income of the Singaporeans)
- This will result in an increase in supply for the S$ as the Singaporeans will have to sell their S$ to obtain ¥
- At the current exchange rate of 81¥ per S$, there will be a surplus of S\$, placing downward pressure on the exchange rate
- As the exchange rate depreciates, the quantity supplied of S$ falls
- This will continue until a new equilibrium exchange rate is reached, where $S_1$ intersects $D$, and the exchange rate is 120¥ per S$ 
- At this exchange rate, the surplus of S$ has been eliminated
- Hence, when supply increases, the equilibrium exchange rate falls and the S$ has depreciates against the ¥
>[!NOTE]
>- An appreciation of the currency can only be caused by a rise in demand for the currency, or a fall in supply of the currency
>- A depreciation of the currency can only be caused by a fall in in demand for the currency, or a rise in supply of the currency
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate will adjust to equalise the currency demand (inflows) and supply (outflows)
- If the current account is in deficit (inflows < outflows), the capital and financial account must be in surplus (outflows > inflows) so that total inflows = total outflows
## Managed float exchange rate system
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate is volatile and will fluctuate daily as market conditions change
- Sometimes, a country prefers to manage its exchange rate so as to eliminate significant fluctuations in order to facilitate decision making in international trade and investments
- Hence, there will adopt a managed float exchange rate system to enjoys some flexibility in managing their exchange rate, while not allowing for sudden massive fluctuations
- The exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate according to market forces within an undisclosed band
- When the value of the currency exceeds the upper limit of the band or falls below the lower limit of the band, active central bank intervention is then necessary
- The central bank intervenes by selling off or buying back the currency in the forex market to keep the exchange rate within the band
- If the exchange rate falls below the band, due to a rise in supply or a fall in demand, the central bank will buy back S$ to increase demand for the S$
- If the exchange rate rises above the band, due to a fall in supply or a rise in demand, the central bank will sell off S$ to increase supply for the S$
- Under a floating exchange rate system, a persistent BOP disequilibrium position is possible as long as the central bank is able to intervene to support the existing exchange rate
## Causes of BOT deficit/ surplus
$$Balance\ of\ trade\ (BOT) = Export\ Revenue - Import\ Expenditure$$
- Very often, a country's BOT is imbalanced i.e. export revenue is not equal to import expenditirue
- Government aim for a favourable BOT position, in which the economy is not experiencing a persistently large balance of trade deficit or surplus
- A worsening of the BOT occurs when the BOT deficit grows or the BOT surplus falls
- A improvement of the BOT occurs when the BOT deficit falls or the BOT surplus grows
### Change in domestic price level
- An increase in domestic prices, assuming foreign prices stay the same would cause imports to become relatively cheaper
- Households will substitute domestic goods with imports, causing a rise in demand for imports
- Hence, import expenditure rises
- The country's exports will become less price competitive, causing a fall in quantity demanded for exports
- Assuming demand for exports if price elastic, the rise in prices would cause a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- Export revenue falls as the rise in revenue from the rise in price is smaller than the fall in revenue from the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- The balance of trade worsens as import expenditure rises and export revenue falls
- This change in prices can be due to different rates of inflation, or change in comparative advantages
#### Different rates of inflation 
- If a country was facing inflation, while the general price levels of its trade partners is general stable, it loses price competitiveness in global markets
#### Changes in comparative advantage
- When developing countries like China or Indonesia embarked on export-oriented industrialization, they developed industries where they would have comparative advantage as they can produce goods for cheaper
- The presence of these cheaper substitutes cause developed countries like the USA to lose their price competitiveness
- This leads to falling demand for DC's exports while DC resident's demand for imports rose
- This leads to a worsening of DC's BOT
- Meanwhile, developing countries will see a rise in demand for their exports
- This leads to an improvement in developing countries BOT
### Change in the exchange rate
- An appreciation of domestic currency of a currency will cause the price of her exports in terms of foreign currency to rise
- Foreigners will lower their demand for exports, causing a fall in export revenue
- The price of imports in domestic currency will fall
- This will lead them to purchase more imports and quantity demanded for imports rises
- If demand for imports is price elastic, quantity demanded will rise by a more than proportionate amount due to the fall in price
- Import expenditure rises as the rise in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded is greater than the fall in revenue from the fall in price
- If demand for import is price in elastic, expenditure on imports will fall
- But, if fall in export revenue outweighs the fall in import expenditure, balance of trade will still worsen
- This will be seen if Marshall-Lerner condition holds 
$$ Marshall-Lerner\ Condition: |PED_x + PED_m| > 1$$
- If the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, appreciation of a currency would lead to a worsening of the BOT, and deprecation would lead to an improvement in the BOT
### Change in the economic growth rate
- A country's export revenue depends on the income level of foreigners
- If a country's key trading partners enter into a recession, the fall in foreigners income will lead to a fall in purchasing power
- Foreigners will demand lesser goods and services including exports, hence export revenue falls, worsening the BOT
- Import expenditure depends on the incomes of domestic consumers
- If there is a fall in domestic income level, domestic consumers will have lesser purchasing power
- They will demand lesser goods and services, including imports
- Hence, import expenditure falls, improving the country's BOT
### Government policies
- Any government policies that affect price competitiveness or a country's growth rate will affect its BOT
- If the government carries out policies to boost economic growth or lower demand-deficient unemployment, the rise in national income will result in consumers buying more imports
- This will worsen the BOT
- If the government engages in protectionism policies to protect domestic industries from foreign imports, this will improve the balance of trade
- E.g. By imposing tariffs, the quantity demanded of imports at each price level falls, causing a fall in demand for imports, leading to a fall in import expenditure
## Consequences of BOT deficit/ surplus
### Consumers
**BOT Deficit**
- If the BOT deficit is due to greater levels of consumption on imported consumer goods and services, in the short-term, consumers will benefit
- This is because there is greater variety and higher level of consumption of goods and services, which bring about a temporarily higher standard of living
- But in the long term, the current standard of living cannot be sustained, and the BOT deficit will lead to a lower standard of living for future generations
- This is because if import expenditure is greater than export revenue, then the excess spending may need to be paid for by borrowing
- Countries that run BOT deficits are net borrowers
- The future generation would then need to sacrifice their consumption to repay the past debt
- They will have to cut back on consumption of imports so that export earning is enough to pay the debts
---
- If a country incurs a BOT deficit from increase its import of capital goods, it sacrifices a rise in living standards in the current period
- This is because the loans could have been used to buy imported consumer goods
- But the rise of imported capital goods increases the country's capital stock, assuming the rate of capital accumulation is greater than the rate of capital depreciation
- This will increase the productive capacity and improve the price competitiveness of the country's exports
- Thus would generate economic growth in the future
- AS rises, represented by a rightward shift in AS
- At the new equilibrium where AD = AS, there is a fall in GPL, leading to a rise in real GDP due to the wealth/ international substitution/ real balances effect
- This is illustrated by a movement along AD, causing a rise in equilibrium national output
- Hence, material standard of living rises in the long run
- The expansion in productive capacity allows the country's exports to be more price competitive, and quantity demand for exports will rise, causing a rise in export revenue
- The country will then have the foreign currency to repay the foreign loans to took to import capital goods, and will not need to cut back on imports in the future

**BOT surplus**
- A BOT surplus means that the country's export revenue exceeds import spending
- The surplus could have been used to finance more imports to the country, exampling the people to consume more
- Thus, households experience a lower standard of living in the short run
- But, a BOT surplus means that a country is a net lender, and is lending money to trading partners to buy its exports
- The country will gain back the principal sum that it lent, along with interest payments from abroad
- This will add to the country's gross national income, which leads to a rise in income and purchasing power, improving standard of living as they can consume more goods
### Firms
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening of the BOT will lead to an increase in outflow of currency, and a reduced inflow of currency
- The supply of the currency rises relative to its demand, causing the country's currency to depreciate
- This improves the price competitiveness of domestic firms' products versus foreign products, as domestic products become cheaper in terms of foreign currency
- Foreign products also become more expensive in terms of domestic currency
- But, this also makes imported inputs more expensive in domestic currency terms, raising the cost of production and potentially reducing profits
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT will lead to an increase in inflow of currency, and a reduced outflow of currency
- The demand for currency rises relative to its supply, causing the country's currency to appreciate
- This worsens price competitiveness of domestic firms' products versus foreign products, as domestic products become more expensive in terms of foreign currency
- Foreign products also become cheaper in terms of domestic currency
- But, this also makes imported inputs cheaper in domestic currency terms, lowering the cost of production and potentially increasing profits
---
- BOT imbalances for countries that control their exchange rate may also cause uncertainty in the stability of the currency, affecting firms expectations and planning
- A country with a managed float exchange system that keeps running a BOT deficit could face pressure on the exchange rate to fall below to the lower limit of the desired range
- In order to prevent the country from depreciating and maintaining the exchange rate, the central bank intervenes by using its foreign reserves to buy back its own currency
- But, as these reserves are finite, some might speculate that the central bank is unable to sustain this intervention and they may be forced to allow the currency to depreciate
- Fluctuations in currency caused by a BOT imbalance is a concern of investors, especially those looking for a long-term presence in the economy (i.e. FDI)
- When there are severe currency changes, or the currency changes too quickly, it becomes difficult for firms to make production and investment decisions
### Governments - Economic growth and unemployment
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening BOT (fall in the value of X-M) results in a fall in AD, and depending on the initial state of the economy, may result in a multiplied fall in real GDP, and a rise in unemployment
- But the extent of the fall depends on the foreign exchange system of the country
- If it is a floating foreign exchange system, a worsening BOT would lead to a depreciation of the foreign exchange rate, leading to an improving BOT, reducing the contractionary impact on national output
- If it is a managed float foreign exchange system, a worsening BOT could cause the foreign exchange to fall below the intervention band
- The central bank intervenes by buying up currency
- But, this causes the domestic money supply to fall, causing AD to fall via a fall in C and I
- Thus, there is further contraction of national output
**Persistently large BOT deficit**
- A persistently large BOT deficit is finance by borrowing from trade partners
- But, when the deficit is large, foreign lenders may doubt the country's ability to pay back the loan
- This is likely when the BOT deficit comes from mainly importing consumer goods and services instead of capital goods
- This fear can cause foreign lenders to cut off all new loans and ask for full repayment on any loans for which the principal can be demanded on such short notice
- The country will then have to cut back on imports, including imports of capital goods, affecting economic growth
---
- A large, persistent and rising BOT deficit can cause foreigners to lose confidence in the stability of the country's foreign exchange rate
- If the country is on a floating exchange rate system, a rising BOT deficit will lead to continued deprecation of the foreign exchange rate
- A depreciation lowers foreigners expected rate of return on investments in the country, and they may sell off their assets 
- If the country is on a managed float exchange rate system, a rising BOT deficit causes the exchange rate to fall below the intervention band
- In order to prevent the country from depreciating and maintaining the exchange rate, the central bank intervenes by using its foreign reserves to buy back its own currency
- But, as these reserves are finite, some might speculate that the central bank is unable to sustain this intervention and they may be forced to allow the currency to depreciate
- This will result in speculation against the currency, and investors may call back their loans, and sell the assets that they own, and move their funds out of the country
- This is known as capital flight, and puts even more downward pressure on the forex rate
- With the foreign exchange rate falling in value, local firms may be unable to afford their foreign loans and might be forced to closed down
- Unemployment results and recession follows as investments will be falling
**Improving BOT**
- An improvement in the BOT, i.e. a rise in the value of net exports will result in a rise in AD, and a rise in GDP if the economy is below full employment
- If the economy is on a floating exchange rate system, it will lead to appreciation of the foreign exchange rate, leading to a worsening BOT, dampening the rise in national output
- If the economy is on a managed float system, an improving BOT puts pressure on the foreign exchange rate to appreciate beyond the desired range
- The central bank will intervene by selling off the domestic currency 
- This will increase the supply of S$ in the forex market and increase the foreign reserves
- Once foreigners spend the domestic currency on the country's goods and services, the local currency ends up in bank accounts to the country's exporters
- Hence, the domestic money supply will rise, and this will cause AD and national income to rise further
**Persistent BOT surplus**
- If a country is experiencing a persistent BOT surplus, it means that its trading partners are experiencing BOT deficits
- They may retaliate by imposing protectionism measures, leading a a fall in ent exports of the country experiencing surplus, reducing output and employment
### Governments - General price stability
**Worsening BOT**
- If an economy was initially experiencing demadn-pull inflation, a worsening BOT helps to rase this pressure as the fall in X-M results in a fall in AD
- But if the worsening BOT leads to a depreciation of the exchange rate, it will cause the price of imported factor inputs to rise, resulting in cost-push inflation
**Improving BOT**
- Countries with improving BOT will experience an increase in AD, bringing about demand-pull inflation, if the country is near full employment, as X-M has risen, causing AD to rise
- But, if the improving BOT leads to an appreciation of the exchange rate, imported inputs become cheaper
- Hence, it reduces imported inflation
