- ==The balance of payments of a country is a statement of all of the international transactions of a country with the rest of the world over a period of time (e.g. a year)==
- In other words, the flows of currency between residents of a country and the rest of the world are recorded in the country's balance of payments
- It is made up of the current account, capital and financial account, and the reserve assets
## Current account
- The current account includes exports and imports of goods and services, primary income, and current transfers
### Payment for exports and imports of goods and services
- Export of goods and services earn income from overseas and are inflows of currency into the country
- Imports of goods and services lead to an expenditure and hence are outflows of currency from the country
- When we take into consideration both exports and imports of goods and services, we get the balance of trade $$Balance\ of\ trade\ (BOT) = Export\ revenue\ - Import\ expenditure$$
### Primary income
- Primary income consists of income flows such as wages, rent, interests, and profits flowing into and out of the country
- For example, US MNCs who have invested in Singapore may send back their profits back to the US and this is recorded as an outflow from Singapore's current account
- Primary income is the difference between income received by Singapore residents from abroad and income payable to non-residents in foreign countries from Singapore
### Current transfers
- Current transfers include unilateral transfers of money across national boundaries by individuals
- E.g. Foreign workers sending a portion of their wages back to their home countries, and government grand sand aid to other countries
- These examples would be recorded as outflows from Singapore's current account
## Capital and financial account
- It includes physical assets, such as land building and factories, and financial assets such as equities, bonds, bank deposits, and loans]
### Direct investments
- These are international sales and purchases of fixed assets such as land, building and factories
- Foreign direct investments (FDI) are classified as long-term capital flows
- FDI would be affected by factors such as business expectations on revenue and cost, government policies, and political/ social stability
- These long-term capital flows are relatively less liquid, and cannot be sold easily or converted into cash without any loss of value
- FDI can entail purchasing of new assets, or buying of existing assets
- If new assets are bought, this would entail production of actual goods and services, causing AD to rise through $I$
- If existing assets are bought, there is no production of actual goods, and no effect on AD
### Portfolio investments
- Portfolio investments covers financial assets such as stocks, bonds and other types of financial investment vehicles
- Some of these assets are relatively less liquid and can easily be converted into cash without any loss of value
- These are classified as short-term capital flows
- If a Singapore resident were to deposit funds in a bank overseas due to a higher interest rates, or expected appreciation of the currency, this would be an outflow of currency 
- Short-term capital flow moving to countries with higher interest rates/ expected appreciation of the exchange rate are known as hot money
## Reserves assets
- This account records the transactions in the official reserves that are held by a country's central bank
- Many banks conduct international transactions of currency to achieve the desired influence on exchange rate
- Central banks can hold foreign reserves, which are in foreign currency, that they can use to buy the home country's currency
- The central bank also has transactions with the IMF as well as other overseas monetary authorities and financial institutions
## Balance of payments equilibrium
- A country's BOP position is determined by the flows of currency in both the current account and the capital and financial account
- The BOP is in equilibrium if the total inflow of currency is equal to the total outflow
- The BOP is in disequilibrium if the net inflow of currency into a country is not 0
- If the inflow of currency exceeds the outflow, there is a BOP surplus
- If the outflow of currency exceeds the inflow, there is a BOP deficit
- Total currency flow matches the changes in a country's reserve assets
- A BOP deficit means that a country needs to draw from tis reserves
- A BOP surplus means that a country is accumulating reserves
## Forex
- Foreign exchange rate is the rate at which currency can be exchanged or traded for another in the forex market
### Demand of a currency
- If a Singaporean wants to go to Malaysia for a holiday, he will need to pay for the goods and services consumed there in Malaysia's local currency, the Ringgit
- He will have to exchange his Singaporean Dollars for Malaysian Ringgit
- If a Japanese firm or individual want to buy Singapore's goods, he will have to pay in Singapore Dollars
- He will need to exchange his currency, the Japanese yen, for the required amount of Singapore dollars, increasing the demand for the Singapore dollar
- Thus, demand for a country's currency in the forex market is dependent on foreign demand for local goods, services, and assets
### Supply of a currency
- In order for a Singaporean firm or individual to purchase foreign goods, services, or assets, they need to exchange Singaporean dollars for the relevant foreign currency
- If a local car dealer wants to import Japanese cars into Singapore, they will need to exchange local Singaporean Dollars to the required amount of Japanese Yen
- Hence, this will cause the supply of Singaporean Dollar to increase
- Hence, the supply of a currency is dependent on the country's demand for foreign goods, services, and assets
## Exchange rate determination
### Floating exchange rate system
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate is determined by market forces (e.g. the interaction of demand and supply of a currency in the forex market)
- There is no government intervention
![[floating exchange rate system.png]]
- The demand curve is downward sloping, as at higher exchange rates, Singapore's goods and services are more expensive in terms of Yen, leading to a fall in quantity demanded
- The supply curve is upward sloping, as at higher exchange rates, Japanese goods and services are less expensive, leading to a rise in quantity supplied to buy foreign goods
- Any changes to demand and supply of the currency will cause the exchange rate to change
### Changes in demand
![[floating exchange rate system change in demand.png]]
- Suppose there is an increase in demand by the Japanese for Singapore's exports due to a non-exchange rate factor (e.g. rise in income of foreigners)
- This would result in an increase in demand for the Singapore Dollar as the Japanese would need Singapore Dollars to pay for Singapore's exports
- The demand curve shifts from $D$ to $D_1$
- At the current exchange rate, there will be a shortage of Singaporean dollars, placing upward pressure on the exchange rate
- As the exchange rate appreciates, the quantity demanded for Singaporean dollars falls, while the quantity supplied increases
- The appreciation will continue until a new equilibrium exchange rate is reached, where $D_1$ intersects $S$
- At this exchange rate, the shortage has been eliminated
- Hence, when demand increases, the equilibrium exchange rate rises and the Singapore dollar has appreciated against the Yen
### Changes in supply
![[floating exchange rate system changes in supply.png]]
- If Singaporeans increase their demand for Japanese imports due toa non-exchange rate factor (e.g. rise in income), there will be an increase in the supply of Singaporean dollars
- This rise in supply is due to Singaporeans selling their Singapore dollar to obtain Yen
- At the current exchange rate, there is a surplus of Singaporean dollars, placing downward pressure on the exchange rate
- As the exchange rate depreciates or weakens, the quantity supplied falls while the quantity demanded increases
- The depreciation will continue until a new equilibrium exchange rate is reached, where $S_1$ intersects $D$
- At this exchange rate, the surplus is eliminated
- Hence, when the supply increase, it causes the exchange rate to fall or weaken, and the Singapore dollar has depreciated or weakened in value against the Yen
### Relationship between BOP and a floating exchange rate system
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate will adjust to equalize the currency demand (inflows) and supply (outflows)
- If the current account is in a deficit, where outflows exceed inflows, the capital and financial account must be in a surplus, where inflows exceed outflows
- This is so that total inflows is equal to total outflows
- A current account deficit must be financed by a surplus in the capital and financial account
### Managed float exchange rate system
- Countries might prefer to manage their exchange rate to eliminate significant fluctuations in order to facilitate decision-making in international trade and investments
- Thus, they adopt a managed float exchange rate system 
- This is so that they can enjoy some flexibility in managing their exchange rates, and not allow for sudden massive fluctuations that can have detrimental effect on their economy
- A managed float exchange rate system is one where the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate according to market forces within an undisclosed band
- If the exchange rate exceeds the upper band, due to a fall in supply or rise in demand, the central bank will sell off local currency to increase supply
- If the exchange rate falls below the band, due to a rise in supply or a fall in demand, the central bank will buy back local currency to increase demand
- Under a managed float exchange rate system, there is a persistent BOP disequilibrium  as long as the country's central bank is able to intervene to support the existing exchange rate
## Causes of BOT Deficit or surplus
- The balance of trade (BOT) is the difference between the value of a country's exports and the value of its imports
- Very often, it is unbalanced, and export revenue is not equal to import expenditure
- Governments aim for a favorable BOT position, where the economy is not experiencing a persistently large balance of trade or surplus
- A worsening of the BOT is when the size of the BOT deficit grows, or the BOT surplus falls
- A improvement in the BOT is when the size of the BOT surplus grows, or the BOT deficit falls
### Changes in domestic price level relative to foreign price level
- An increase in domestic prices would cause import to become relatively cheaper
- This causes domestic households to switch towards imports
- Demand for imports rises, causing import expenditure to increase
- The country's exports will also become less price competitive, causing a fall in quantity demanded for exports
- Assuming demand for the country's exports is price elastic, export revenue falls more than proportionately
- Export revenue falls as the rise in revenue from the rise in price is smaller than the fall in revenue from the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- The rise in import expenditure and the fall in export revenue will cause the balance of trade to worsen
#### Different rates of inflation between countries
- If the country is facing inflation while the general price levels of its trade partners is generally stable, it loses price competitiveness
- E.g. if a country is facing cost push inflation due to wage rate rising faster than labor productivity, causing their goods to be less price competitive and the BOT worsens
#### Change in comparative advantage
- Developing countries like China develop industries where they have comparative advantage in
- E.g. Their labor abundance allows them to make produce goods cheaper in labor-intensive industries
- The presence of these cheaper substitutes causes developed countries like the USA to lose their price competitiveness
- This leads to a fall in demand for developed countries exports of labor-intensive manufacturing goods
- Developed countries' residents quantity demanded for imports also rose
- This would worsen the developed country's BOT
- The developing countries would see a rise in demand for exports, and an improvement in their BOT
### Changes in exchange rate
- An appreciation of domestic currency of a country will cause the prices of exports in terms of foreign currency to rise, and the prices of imports to fall
- Foreigners will lower their demand for Singapore's exports
- With a lower quantity of exports sold at the same price, export revenue falls
- Singaporeans will find imported goods cheaper, and will increase their quantity demanded
- If demand for imports is price elastic, import expenditure rises
- This is because the fall in revenue from the fall in price is lesser than the rise in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded
- If demand for imports is price inelastic, expenditure on imports will fall
- But, if the fall in export revenue outweighs the fall in import expenditure, the balance of trade will still worsen
- Assuming the Marshal-Lerner condition holds, an appreciation of a country's currency would lead to a worsening of the trade balance $$|PED_X + PED_M| > 1$$
- A deprecation of the country's currency would lead to an improvement in the balance of trade
### Changes in economic growth rates
- A country's export revenue depends on the income level of foreigners
- If a country's trading partners enter a recession, the fall in foreigners income would lead to a fall in purchasing power
- This would lead to a fall in demand for goods and services, including exports, thus export revenue would fall, worsening the BOT
- On the other hand, if domestic consumers experience a fall in income, their purchasing power would fall, and they would demand lesser goods and services, including imports
- This would cause import expenditure to fall, improving the BOT
- If there was a rise in domestic income level, domestic consumers would demand more imports, causing import expenditure to rise, worsening the BOT
### Government policies
- If the government carries out policies to boost the country's economic growth, or lower demand deficient employment, there would be a rise in national income
- This would increase local's purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services, including imports
- Import expenditure rises, worsening the BOT
- Governments may also engage in protectionism policies to protect domestic industries from foreign imports, improving the BOT
## Consequences of a BOT deficit or surplus
### Consumers
**BOT deficit**
- If the BOT deficit is due to a greater levels of consumption of imported consumer goods and services, in the short-term, consumers will benefit
	- This is becuase there is more variety and a higher level of consumption of goods and services
	- Thus, there is a temporarily higher material standard of living
- But in the long-term, the higher standard of living currently enjoyed cannot be sustained, and there will be a lower standard of living for future generations
	- If spending on imported consumer goods and services is higher than what is spent on exports, the excess spending needs to be financed by lending
	- They will borrow form foreign lenders
	- Countries that run BOT deficits are net borrowers
	- The future generation will have to sacrifice their consumption to repay this past debt, and will have to cut back on their consumption of imports
	- Thus, the standard of living will fall in the future
- If the BOT deficit is from increasing its import of capital goods, it sacrifices a rise in living standards in the current period as the loans could have been used to import goods
- But with more imported capital goods, the country's capital stock rises and improve the price competitiveness of the goods and services
	- This will boost the quantity demanded for exports and generate economic growth
	- The increase in productive capacity and factor productivity causes AS to rise and shift down
	- This would lead to a fall in prices, causing a rise in domestic consumption and net exports, reflected as a movement along AD
	- It would also causes a rise in national output, meaning that consumers material standard of living rises in the long run
	- Also, the expansion in productive capacity allows a country to gain price competitiveness, and it can export more and earn more export revenue
	- The country will have the foreign currency to thus repay the loans that it took to finance the increase in import of capital goods in the current period
	- There is no need to cut back on imports in the future
**BOT surplus**
- A BOT surplus means that the country's export revenue exceeds its import expenditure, and this surplus could have been used to finance more imports
	- Locals could have consumed more, and thus there is a lower standard of living in the short run
- But, a BOT surplus means that the country is a net lender, and it can gain back the principal sum it lent, and interest payments from abroad
	- These interest earnings adds to the country's national income, increasing locals purchasing power, and hence material standards of living in the long run
### Firms
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening BOT would lead to an increase in the outflow of currency and a reduced inflow of currency
- I.e. the supply of currency rises relative to its demand, causing the country's currency to depreciate
- This improve the price competitiveness of domestic firms products , as domestic product become cheaper in foreign currency terms
- Foreign products also become more expensive in domestic currency terms
- However, it would make imported inputs more expensive in domestic currency terms, raising the cost of production and reducing profits
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT would lead to a decrease in outflow of currency and increased inflow of currency
- I.e. the demand of currency rises relative to the supply, causing the country's currency to appreciate
- This worsens price competitiveness of domestic firms products, as domestic products become more expensive in foreign currency terms
- Foreign products become cheaper in domestic currency terms
- However, it would make imported inputs cheaper in domestic currency terms, lowering the cost of production and increasing profits
---
- BOT imbalance for countries that are under a managed float exchange rate system may also cause uncertainty in the stability of the currency
- This will affect firms expectations and planning
- For example, a country under a managed float exchange rate system that runs a BOT deficit could face pressure on the BOT to fall below the lower limit
- In order to prevent the currency from depreciating and to maintain the current exchange rate, the central bank intervenes by using foreign reserves to buy back local currency
- But, these reserves are finite and there might be speculation that the central bank may be forced to allow its currency to depreciate
- MNCs that require a stable currency to make investment decisions would be concerned by fluctuations in currency cause by BOT imbalances
- This is especially true for investors who are looking for a long-term presence in the economy (FDI)
- All investors hope to gain profit after a certain amount of time
- When there are severe currency changes or currency changes too quickly, it becomes difficult for firms to make production and investment decisions
### Governments - Economic growth and employment
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening BOT, would lead to a fall in $(X-M)$ and a fall in AD and depending in the initial state of the economy, would lead to a multiplied fall in national income
- It could lead to a rise in unemployment
- But, the extent of this fall would depend on the foreign exchange system in their country
- In a floating exchange rate system, a worsening BOT would cause a depreciation in the exchange rate, leading to an improving BOT
- This reduces the contractionary impact on national output, and the overall fall in AD may not be so much
- In a managed float exchange rate system, a worsening BOT could cause the foreign exchange rate to fall below the intervention band
- The central bank would have to prevent this depreciation by buying up local currency
- This causes domestic money supply to fall via $C$ and $I$, causing further contraction of national output, assuming the economy was initially below $Y_f$
**Persistently large BOT deficit**
- A persistently large BOT deficit would be financed by borrowing from trading partners
- When a country runs a persistently large BOT deficit, foreign lenders might lose confidence in the country's ability repay its loans
- This is likely when the country's BOT deficit arose mainly from the import of consumers goods/ services instead of capital goods
- This fear can cause foreign lenders to cut off all new loans and ask for full repayment on any loans for which the principal can be demand on such short notice
- The country would have to cut back on imports, including the import of capital goods, affecting economic growth
---
- Moreover, a large, persistent and rising BOT deficit can cause foreigners to lose confidence in the stability of the country's foreign exchange rate
- If the country is on a floating exchange rate system, a rising BOT deficit would lead to continued depreciation of the foreign exchange rate
- As depreciation lowers expected rate of returns on investments in the country, they could sell off their assets
- If the country is on a managed float exchange rate system, a rising BOT deficit puts pressure on the foreign exchange rate to fall below the desired range
- If this persists, there can be a belief that the central bank may be short on foreign reserves and thus incapable of supporting the current exchange rate
- This would result in speculation against the currency, causing foreign investors to call back their loans and sell their assets that they own in the country and move funds out
- This is known as capital flight
- This puts more downward pressure on the forex rate
- Without enough foreign reserves, the exchange rate would be forced to depreciate
- When the foreign exchange rate falls in value, local firms may become unable to service their foreign loans and may be forced to close
- Unemployment results and recession follows as investments would be falling
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT would result in a rise in AD, and a rise in equilibrium national income, output, and employment if the economy is below full employment
- The extent of the rise depends on the foreign exchange rate system
- If it is on a floating exchange rate system, an improving BOT would cause the foreign exchange rate to increase
- This would lead to a worsening of the BOT, dampening the rise in national output
- If it is on a managed float exchange rate system, an improving BOT causes the exchange rate to appreciate beyond the desired range
- The central bank needs to sell the domestic currency in exchange for foreign currency to prevent the appreciation
- This would increase the money supply in the forex market, and increase the country's foreign reserves
- Once the foreigners spend the domestic currency on the country's goods and services, the local currency ends up in local bank accounts
- This increases the domestic supply, causing AD and national income to rise further through $C$ and $I$, assuming there is spare capacity
**Persistent BOT surplus**
- IF the country is experiencing a persistent BOT surplus, its trading partners are experiencing BOT deficits
- They may retaliate and impose protectionism measures, resulting in a fall in net exports of the country experiencing a BOT surplus, reducing output and employment
### Governments - General price stability
**Worsening BOT**
- If economy was initially overheated with high demand-pull inflation, a worsening BOT helps to ease this pressure as the fall in $(X-M)$ causes a fall in AD
- But, if the worsening BOT results in the depreciation of the exchange rate, it will cause the price of imported inputs to rise, resulting in imported inflation
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT would result a rise in AD, bringing about demand pull inflation if the economy is operating near full employment
- But, if the improving BOT results in the appreciation of the exchange rate, it would cause imported inputs to become cheaper, reducing imported inflation
