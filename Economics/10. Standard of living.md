- Governments aim to manage 4 macroeconomic goals
	1. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth
	2. Low unemployment
	3. Price stability
	4. Favourable Balance of Trade (BOT)
- Attainment of these 4 goals enables governments to bring about increases in well-being or living standards over time, which is the overarching goal of governments
- ==A country's standard of living is the well-being of its residents==
- ==Material standard of living comes from the consumption of goods and services==
- ==Non-material standard of living comes from intangibles (e.g. job satisfaction, leisure time, environment, security)==
## National income
- National income is the total income earned by a nation from producing the country's total final output over a given period of time
- National product is the total final output of a country over a period of time
- National expenditure is the total spending on a country's total output over a period of time
- National income is equal to national product and national expenditure
- National expenditure is equal to national product as the amount of spending on a country's total final output is equal to the value of that output
- To produce that output, firms employ factors of production, which are owned by households
- In a free market economy, all FOPs are owned by households, and they offer their FOPs to firms in return for income
- Firms pay for these FOPs from the revenue they earn from selling the final output, which is equal to the national expenditure
- The revenue will all be paid out as wages, rent, interest, and profits to the households
## Measures of national income
- ==Gross domestic product (GDP) is the value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production within a country's geographical boundaries, during a period of time==
- The value of final goods and services is included in a nation's GDP if they are produced within the geographical confines of the country, regardless of who owns the FOPs
- ==Gross national income (GNI) is the value of all final goods and services produced during a period of time by factors of production owned by residents of a country, regardless of whether these FOPs are within the geographical boundary of the country or abroad==
- The value of all final goods and services are included in a nation's GNI as long as they are produced by FOPs owned by residents, regardless of there these FOPs are located
- Residents that own FOPs that are located abroad and are used to produce final goods and services will earn factor income from abroad, and this is counted towards GNI
- Foreigners who earn factor income from productions in a country will have their income flow out of the country to the their home countries
- This is known as factor income paid abroad and is excluded from GNI $$GNI = GDP + Factor\ income\ from\ abroad - Factor\ income\ paid\ abroad$$
### Real VS nominal values
- A real value is a measure of value that is adjusted for changes in prices over time
- GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced by FOPs located within within a country's geographical boundaries during a given time period
- Since the value of a good is price times quantity of the good, when a country's GDP changes over time it could be due to a change in prices, quantity, or both
- To find out whether and economy has grown, economists are interested in finding out how the quantity of final goods and services has changed over time
- Hence, they use real GDP, which discounts inflation
### Aggregate VS per capita values
- Nominal and real GDP measure the value of a country's output or income in aggregate terms
- Economists use per capita to measure a country's average level of output or income
### Real GDP per capita
- National income is used to indicate living standards as a nation's income level reflect residents ability to consume goods and service
- National income is thus a fundamental determinant of a country's material aspects of living
- Real GDP per capita is used to measure and compare a country's standard of living over time
- Using Real GDP helps to account for change in the general price level
- By valuing a country's final output at constant prices, an increase in value can only be from a rise in the economy's output
- This reflects the economy's increased ability to satisfy people's material needs and wants
- Whether a country's material well-being rises over time depends on whether the quantity of goods and services has risen
- When a rise in nominal national income is due to a rise in prices, with negligible increases in output and hence consumption, there is negligible improvement in material well-being
- Per capita is to account for population size over time
- As long as national income is rising faster than the population growth rate, such that national income is rising, the average persons purchasing power is rising
- This would imply that the average person's level of consumption of goods and services has increased, improving material well-being
## Limitations of using real national income to compare living standards over time
### Data collection problems
- National income statistics is calculated from millions of returns to the government, and mistakes may rise due to omission, double counting, or inflation of figures
- Income tax returns may be understates because information provided by taxpayers are inaccurate or forms may be incomplete
- These are especially true for developing countries where proper accounting systems are not in place, officials lack expertise, and there are many inaccessible areas
### Size of the underground economy
- The underground economy is the sector in which transactions are not reported to the official authorities
- It includes illegal production (e.g. manufacturing and trafficking drugs), which are not declared in income tax returns due to their illicit nature
- Legal activities that are not included in income tax returns ,such as moonlighting where people do extra work outside of their normal jobs
- There is also casual jobs, which is income not declared by the unemployed for fear of losing unemployment benefits
- These are omitted in national income figures, understating the country's national income figures
- If the underground economy has been growing in size, increases in national income per capita will understate the rise in living standards
- The underground economy can be significant where crimes such as drug dealing are pervasive
### Changes in the size of the non-market economy
- GDP only captures the value of final goods and services that are traded in the market
- Any output produced by labor services that do not pass through a market is not counted in national income statistics even though they contribute to the total output of goods
- The exclusion of 'do-it-yourself' and other home-based or voluntary activities such as cooking at a soup kitchen or doing chores understates the true level of production
- Some developing countries like Cambodia have a large subsistence sector where people grow crops for their own consumption and barter trade
- This could result in a significant undervaluation of a country's GDP as the output from the subsistence sector is excluded from the GDP
### Changes in distribution of national income
- An increase in real GDP per capita may not reflect an increase in income of all residents equally as real GDP per capita reports the income of the average citizen
- Real GDP per capita assumes that income is distributed equally, but national income is unequally distributed among the population
- If income is concentrated in the hands of the rich minority, then the economic well-being of the typical individual may not have improved
#### Gini coefficient
- The gini coefficient measures the degree of inequality in income distribution in a population
- It can be from 0 to 1, where 0 Is perfect income equality
- The higher the gini coefficient, the higher the income inequality in the nation
![[gini coffecient.jpg]]
- If national income levels are increasing, a large gini coefficient would indicate that the improvements in households standard of living are not equally distributed
- If the gini coefficient rises over time, it implies widening income inequality in a country
- It helps to provide a more complete picture of how GDP/ GNI is distributed, and what extent the real GDP/ GNI per capita reflects the living standards of an average person
- If real GDP per capita is rising, but the gini coefficient is large, the rise in national income per capita would have overstated the improvements in standard of living
- This is because the rise in income is not equally distributed among households
### Changes in composition of national income
- National income measures a country's level of production, but it may be a poor indicator of the consumption level by a country's standards
- This is because a country's output includes both consumption goods and investment goods, but current material well-being depends only on consumption goods
- If national income rises as a result of a rise in the production of capital goods, it will not lead to a rise in current standard of living
- Instead, it will lead to an increase in future production and consumption, improving future standard of living
- A rise in national income that stems from a rise in export would overstate the rise in standard of living if the income generated from exports is not spend on consumer goods
- A rise in national income due to an increase in government expenditure on military will not lead to a rise in standard of living 
- Such spending does not enhance material well-being as it does not contribute to household's' current wants
### Ignore non-material aspect of SOL
- National income figures take no account of externalities produced by the economy
- Increase in production is often accompanied by higher levels of pollution
- This is because firms are profit motivated, and will not take into consideration the health costs incurred by third parties when the pollute the environement
- The detonation of the environment leads to poorer health in residents and would offset the increase in material standard of living
- If an increase in national income is the result of people having to work harder or longer hours, a rise in national income would overstate the improvement in standard of living
- This is because the fall from reduced leisure time offsets the gain from producing and consumer a greater quantity of goods and services
- But, if national income rises and the length of the typical workday shortens, a growth in national income will understate the improvements in standard of living
## Limitations of using real national income to compare living standards between countries
### Inaccuracy of national income figures
- National income statistics may understate the actual level of production from country to country, depending on the size of the underground and the non-marketed economy
- This is especially significant in developing countries, which have a large subsistence farming and agricultural sector, and a large underground economy
- It is therefore inaccurate to directly compare DCs and LDCs as LDCs may face more complex measurement problems
### Differences in currencies used and problems with market exchange rates
- Fluctuating exchange rates would give different values of GDP, even when there is no change in domestic values
- Exchange rates vary from day to day, and changes can be abrupt
- If the GDP is converted to a common currency using market exchange rates, the GDP can also fluctuate for reasons that have nothing to do with the level of economic activity
- Market exchange rate do not reflect the relative differences in prices across countries
- Market exchange rates may be a poor indicator of the relative purchasing power of the currency
- To compensate, GDP is converted to a common currency at the purchasing power parity rate
- Purchasing power parity measures how many units of one country's currency are needed to buy the exact same basket of goods and services
### Differences in the distribution of income
- A country's GDP per capita may be higher than the other country's, but the average standard of living in the former may be lower due to greater income inequality
- Developing countries tend to have greater disparities in income distribution as income is concentrated in the hands of the wealthier minority
- This means that in some countries, the rich minority could afford to buy many luxury goods, while there are many that could be living in poverty
- This is despite income inequality widening in developed countries and narrowing in certain developing countries
- Thus, in comparing living standards between countries, there is a need to supplement GDP per capita with measures of income distribution
### Differences in the proportion of national income spent on different goods
- Countries with a similar GDP per capita may produce a substantially different range of goods and service and hence have different levels of living standards
- If one country spends more on defence, they could have a lower standard on living as defensive goods such as missiles do not contribute to households immediate wants
- If one country spends more on investment goods like machinery (capital goods), their well being may be lower as investment goods do not satisfy household's wants
- Instead, they increase future living standards by generating economic growth
### Differences in non-material aspect of SOL
- The higher output in some countries may be accompanied by higher levels of pollution, congestion, depletion of natural resources, lowering non-material standard of living
- National income would thus overstate the standard of living of such countries
- The higher GDP per capita of some countries may the result of people working harder or longer hours, leading to lesser leisure time, and a lower non-material standard of living
### Why its still used
- Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher material and non-material standard of living
- The higher the per-capita income levels, the greater the extent that people in the country can afford to satisfy basic material needs like healthcare
- The higher the income levels, the more tax revenue is collected and is available for the government to pursue policies that improve non-material standard of living
- Governments can incentivise firms to invest in cleaner methods of production via subsidies and grants
- They can also use these resources to enforce more stringent environmental laws
- Thus, there is also a high correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy, which reflect non-material standard of living
## Other indicators
### HDI
- It is a composite index that combines
1. **Life expectancy** 
	- Longevity can be impacted by the access to certain goods and services, such as quality healthcare, healthy food options for better nutrition
	- A higher life expectancy implies greater access to these goods and services, and a lower life expectancy implies poorer access to these goods and services
	- Longevity is also determined by the non-material aspects of SOL such as work-life balance and air quality
	- With better work-life balance, stress levels are lower, leading to better health and longer life expectancy
	- A higher life expectancy suggest higher air quality as cleaner air reduces the risk of negative impacts such as respiratory illnesses, enabling people to live longer
	- A country with a lower life expectancy suggest poorer performance in these aspects
2. **Education index**
	- A country with higher adult literacy rates suggests greater access to educational materials such as textbooks, and services by teachers and lecturers in schools
	- A country with lower adult literacy suggest poorer access to these resources and lower material SOL
3. **Income index (GNI at PPP)**
	- Higher GNI per capita suggests greater purchasing power to buy goods and services for the satisfaction of materials wants and needs
	- A country with a higher GNI per capita has a higher material SOL and a country with lower GNI per capita has a lower material SOL
- It was made to asses the development of a country not just in economic growth alone
- But, it does not reflect poverty, security, empowerment
- It fails to reflect inequalities as it takes averages
- It uses GNI per capita instead of GDP, and inaccuracies in GNI affect the accuracy
### Leisure time
- We can measure the average working hours per worker, or the average leisure time per worker
- The more time people spend on work, the less time they have to spend on other activities
- The higher the working hours or the lower leisure time workers have, the poorer the work-life balance in the country, suggesting a lower non-material standard of living
### Pollution index
- We can use indices that measure the level of pollution
- The pollution standards index (PSI) is used in Singapore
- The higher the PSI, the poorer the air quality in Singapore, and the lower the non-material standard of living
