## Overarching goal of improved living standards
- Governments aim for these four macroeconomic goals
	- Sustainable and inclusive economic growth
	- Full employment
	- Price stability
	- Favorable balance of trade (BOT)
- These goals help to achieve increases in society's well-being or living standards over time, which is the overarching macroeconomic goal of governments
## Standard of living
- ==The standard of living refers to the well being of its residents==, comprising of two aspects
	- Material well being, which stems from the consumption of consumer goods and services
	- Non-material well being, which refers to aspects of well-being that stems from intangibles (job satisfaction, leisure time, the environment, security, etc)
- Cost of living is the expenditure (amount consumers need to spend) needed to reach a certain standard of living
- Higher cost of living -> Lower SOL, ceteris paribus
## Use of national income to measure and compare living standards
- ==National income is the total income earned by a nation from producing the country's total final output over a given period of time==
- ==National product is the value of the total final output of a country over time==
- ==National expenditure is the total spending on a country's total output over a period of time==
- They are all equal
- National expenditure must equal national national product because the amount of spending on a country's final output must equal the value of the product
- Households own all factors of production in a free market economy
- To produce the national output, firms must employ factors of production which are owned by the households
- Households offer their FOPs to firms for production in return for income
- Firms pay for these FOPs out of the revenue they earn from from selling the final output
- The revenue that is earned by firms from selling the final output will be paid out as rent, wages, interest and profits to the households
- Hence, total income earned by households is equal to national expenditure, which is equal to national product
## Measures of national income
### GDP
- ==GDP (Gross Domestic Product) refers to the value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production located within a country's geographical boundaries, during a given period of time==
- Residents here and foreigners here
- The value of all final goods and services are included in the GDP as long as they are produced within the geographic confines of the country, regardless of who owns the factors of production
### GNI
- ==GNI is the value of all final goods and services by factors of production owned by residents of a country, regardless of whether these factors of production  are located within the geographical boundary of the country or abroad==
- Residents here and overseas
- The value of all final goods and services are included in the GNI as long as they are produced by factors of production owned by residents, regardless of whether these factor inputs are located
- A country's residents may own factors of production that are located abroad and sued to produce final output overseas
- These residents will earn **factor income from abroad,** which is counted towards the country's GNI
- Foreigners earn factor income from their production operations in a country, and this income will flow out of that country to the home country of the foreigners
- This is called **factor incomes paid abroad** and is excluded from the countries GNI
- GNI is calculated by adding GDP factor income earned by residents form their factors of production located overseas and subtracting factor income earned by non-residents in the domestic economy 
- $GNI = GDP + Factor\ income\ from\ abroad + Factor\ income\ paid\ abroad$ $= GDP + Net\ factor\ income\ from\ abroad$
### Real VS Nominal values
- ==A real value is a measure of value that is adjusted for changes in prices over time==
- GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced by FOPs within a country's geographical boundaries during a given time period
- Since the value of a good equals price multiplied by quantity of that good, when a country's GDP changes over time, it could be due purely to changes in prices, changes in quantity or both
- To find out whether an economy has grown, economists are interested in finding out how the quantities of final goods and services has changed over time
- ==Nominal GDP is the GDP value measured in terms of the prevailing market prices of the goods and services that year==
- ==Real GDP is the GDP value measured in terms of the prices of goods and services in a particular base year==
- If national income has risen by 8%, but prices of goods and services have also risen by the same percentage, then the residents materiel living standards did not increase
- We can find the increase in real GDP by using $$\%\ increase\ in\ real\ GDP = \% \ increase\ in\ nominal\ GDP - \%\ Increase\ in\ prices$$
### Aggregate vs Per capita values
- Nominal and real GDP measure the value of a country's output or income in aggregate or total terms
- To measure a country's average level of output or income, economists use per capita measures, which means per person
- They do so by dividing a total measure such as GDP or GNI by the appropriate population
$$GDP\ per\ capita = \frac{GDP}{Total\ population}$$
- It shows the real purchasing power on average for a country
- We can find the increase in GDP per capita by using $$\%\ increase\ in\ GDP\ per\ capita = \% \ increase\ in\ GDP - \%\ Increase\ in\ population$$
### Comparing a country's standard of living over time
- National income is used to indicate living standards, because as a measure of a nation's income level, it reflects the nation's resident's ability to consume goods and services
- National income is thus a fundamental determinant of a country's material aspects of living standards
- ==Real GDP per capita is used to measure and compare a country's living standards over time==
- We need to use **real** as it accounts for changes in the general price level (inflation)
	- By valuing a country's final output at constant prices, any increase in value can only be due to a rise in the economy's output, and reflects the economy's increased ability to satisfy peoples' material needs and wants
	- Whether a countries material well-being rises over time depends on whether the quantity of goods and services produced has risen
	- It does not rise due to rises in the general price level (inflation)
	- When there is a rise in nominal national income due to increase in prices, with negligible increase in output and hence consumption, there will be negligible improvement in material SOL
- We need to use **per capita** to account for changes in population size
	- As long as the countries real national income is rising faster than the population rate, such that real GDP per capita is rising, the average person's purchasing power, and thus level of consumption has increased
	- This leads to an improvement in material well-being over time
## Limitations of real GDP per capita to compare living standards over time
### Data collection problems
- National income statistics is calculated from millions of returns to the government
- Mistakes may arise due to problems of omission, double counting, or tax evasion
- Omission is when income tax returns are inaccurate, or forms are incomplete, causing income tax returns to be understated
- Double counting errors in output methods lead to overstating GDP
- Tax evasion is more severe in developing countries, and causes understating of the GDP
- Difficulties in data collection are often compounded in developing countries
- Proper accounting systems are not in place, officials may lack the expertise, and there are many inaccessible areas
### Size of the underground economy
- The underground economy is the sector in which transactions are not reported to official authorities
- Consists of Illegal production (drug manufacturing and trafficking, guns,etc) and Legal activities that are not declared in income tax returns
- Because of the illicit nature of illegal production, these activities are naturally not declared in income tax returns, and are omitted in national income figures
- Some legal activities that are not declared in tax returns are 
	- Moonlighting, where people do extra work outside of their normal jobs;  
	- casual jobs where the income is not declared by those who are "unemployed" for fear of losing unemployment benefits
- Unrecorded transactions in the underground economy understate the country's national income figures
- Significant in countries where crimes such as drug dealing, anonymous shell corporations, and money laundering is pervasive
### Changes in the size of the non-market economy (non-market sector)
- Any output that does not pass through a market is not counted in national income statistics
- Home-based/ voluntary activities 
	- If you paid someone to paint your house, the income they earn from painting is reported in the national income statistics
	- But if you paint it yourself, you will not be paying yourself, and there will not be a record of it in national income statistics
- The exclusion of these home-based/ voluntary activities causes the national income to understate the true level of production in an economy
- Subsistence agriculture
	- People may grow crops for their own consumption, causing national income statistics to understate the true level of production of the economy as it is excluded from the GDP 
### Changes in the distribution of national income
- An increase in real GDP per capita may not reflect an increase in income of all residents equally
- Real GDP per capita reports the income of the average citizen
- If the increase in income is concentrated in the hands of the rich minority, the economic well being of the typical individual may not have improved
- We can use the [[6. Inequity#Income inequality |gini coefficient]] to supplement this
- The greater the gini coefficient, the greater the income inequality
- If the gini coefficient increases over time, there is widening income inequality in the country and vice versa
- It provides a more complete picture of how GDP/ GNI is distribution, and the extent to which real GDP/ GNI per capita reflects the living standards of a typical person in the country
- If a country's real GDP per capita is rising, but the gini coefficient is large, the rise in the real national income per head would have overstated the rise in the improvements in standard of living of the average resident as income is not equally distributed
### Changes in the composition of national income
- National income measures a countries level of production, but may be a poor indicator of the consumption level by the country 
- This is because national output includes both consumption goods and investment goods, but current material well-being depends only on consumption goods
- If national income rises from a rise in production of capital goods, with will not lead to a rise in current SOL, but an increase in future production and consumption, and thus future SOL
- A rise in national income from a rise in exports would overstate the rise in SOL if the income generated from exports is not spent on consumer goods
- A rise in national income due to an increase in government expenditure on military armaments will not lead to a rise in SOL as it does not enhance material well-being since they do not contribute to household's current wants
### Ignores non-material aspects of SOL
- Negative externalities
	- National income figures take no account of externalities produced by the economy
	- Increase in production is often accompanied by higher level of pollution
	- Firms are profit motivated and do not take into account the health costs borne by third parties when the pollute the environment
	- The pollution of the environment leads to poorer health of residents, offsetting the rise in material SOL
	- Thus, this increase in national income may overstate the increase in SOL
- Leisure time
	- If national income is rising as people are working longer hours, then the growth in national income may overstate the improvement in SOL
	- The loss from reduced leisure (non-material SOL) offsets the gain from producing and consuming a greater quantity of goods (material SOL)
	- If national income rises and the length of the typical work day shortens, a growth in in national income will understate the improvement in SOL
## Limitations of real GDP per capita to compare living standards across countries
### Inaccuracy of national income figures
### Differences in currencies used and problems using market exchange rates
### Differences in distribution of income
### Differences in proportion of national income spent on different types of goods
### Differences in non-material aspects of SOL
## Why do we still use GDP per capita to compare across countries?
## Other indicators
### Human Development index
### Measures of leisure time for non-material SOL
### Measures of quality of the environment for non-material SOL
