- When a market fails to allocate resources efficiently, the market equilibrium quantity is not allocative efficient
- There is over/ under production/ consumption of goods and services
- In some cases, goods and services may not even be produced
## Externalities
- ==An externality refers to a positive or negative impact on a third party not involved in the consumption or production of a good or service==
### Positive
- P: Point out the source of market failure
	- People who consume vaccines benefit themselves as they reduce the likelihood of being infected
	- People around them are also less likely to fall ill as well, as the person who consumed it is less likely to fall ill, even though they did not consume it
	- They enjoy a positive externality from the consumption of vaccines, which is an external benefit to thirds parties not involved in the consumption of the good
>[!NOTE]
>Remember to include where the extenality is happening (consumption or production)

![[positive externality.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The positive externality cases the marginal social benefit (MSB) to be greater than the marginal private benefit (MPB) of consuming vaccines
	- This is becuase MSB = MPB + MEB
	- The existence of MEB causes the MSB curve to be higher than the MPB curve, where the vertical distance in between is equal to MEB
	- Assuming no negative externalities, MPC = MSC
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Under the free market, consumers will base their consumption decisions based on their MPB, and disregard the external benefits
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be $Q$ and market equilibrium price will be at $P$, where demand equal supply
	- But, the socially optimal output and price is at $Q^*$ and $P^*$, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximized 
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- Thus, there is underconsumption of vaccines of $Q^{*} - Q$ units, resulting in welfare loss to society
	- For $Q^{*} - Q$ units, the MSB is greater than the MSC
	- There is a gain to society's welfare if $Q^{*} - Q$ more units was consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- The total social benefits to consuming $Q^{*} - Q$ units is given by area $A + B$
	- The total social costs of consuming $Q^{*} - Q$ units is given by area $B$
	- The deadweight loss of consuming the market equilibrium output is area $A$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximized

### Negative
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- The production of electricity by burning coal imposes a cost to producers as they have to pay for factors of production like raw materials (e.g. coal)
	- In addition, it also produces air pollution, which cause health problems to third parties as they inhale the polluted air and have to incur medical expenses
	- They suffer a negative externality, which is an external cost to third parties not involved in the production of the good
![[Negative externality.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The negative externality causes the marginal social cost (MSC) to be greater than the marginal private cost (MPC)
	- This is becuase MSC = MPC + MEC
	- This causes the MSC curve to be higher than the MPC curve, where the MEC is the vertical distance between the two curves
	- Assuming no positive externalities, the MPB curve is equal to the MSB curve
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Under the free market, consumers will base their decisions on their MPC, and disregard any external costs
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand meets supply
	- But, the socially optimal price and output will be at $P^*$ and $Q^*$, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximized
- A: Allocative efficiency
	- Thus, there is overproduction of energy of $Q - Q^*$ units
	- This is because for $Q - Q^*$ units, MSC is greater than MSB
	- There is a loss to society's welfare from producing $Q - Q^*$ units
- D: Deadweight loss
	- The total social benefit of producing $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $E$
	- The total social cost of producing $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $D + E$ 
	- The deadweight loss of consuming the market equilibrium output is given by area $D$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximized
## Imperfect information
- ==Occurs when potential buyers/ sellers have incomplete/ inaccurate/ uncertain/ limited info, causing them to make wrong choices, leading to market failure==
### Consumer ignorance 
#### Underestimation of true private benefits
- P: Point out the source of market failure
	- The consumption of healthcare confers long-term benefits to ones own health and wellbeing, such as reducing the likelihood of further health complications
	- But, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these long-term gains and under-estimate the true benefits that healthcare provides
![[Imperfect info benefits.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The underestimation of benefits by the consumer causes the perceived marginal private benefit (MPB) to be lower than the true MPB of consuming healthcare
	- Consumers would based their consumption decision on their perceived MPB and hence the perceived MPB curve is the demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the true MPB curve, and the MSC curve will be the same as the MPC curve, which is the supply curve
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
	- The socially optimal output is at $Q^*$, where MSC = MSB, and societies' welfare is maximized
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- There is underconsumption of healthcare of $Q^* - Q$ units
	- For $Q^* - Q$ units, MSB is greater than MSC
	- There is additional gain to societies welfare if $Q^* - Q$ units were consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- The total social benefit of consuming $Q^* - Q$ units is given by area $M + N$
	- The total social cost of consuming $Q^* - Q$ units is given by area $N$
	- The deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units is given by area $M$
	- Therefore there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximized
#### Underestimation of true private costs
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- The smoking of cigarettes causes long term harm to one's own health and well being
	- But, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these harms from smoking, and overestimate the true value that smoking cigarettes provides
![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The over-estimation of the value of smoking by the consumer causes the perceived MPB to be higher than the true MPB
	- Consumers would base their consumption decisions based on the true MPB of smoking cigarettes, thus the perceived MPB curve is also the demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the true MPB curve is the same as the MSB curve, and the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is the same as the supply curve
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Left to market forces, market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
	- The socially optimal output is $Q*$, where MSC = MSB, and societies' welfare is maximized
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- There overconsumption of cigarettes of $Q - Q^*$ units
	- For $Q - Q^*$ units, the MSC is greater than the MSB
	- There is a net loss to societies welfare from these additional units consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- The total social cost of consuming $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $A+B$
	- The total social benefit of consuming $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $B$
	- The deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units is given by area $A$
	- Therefore there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximized
### Asymmetric information
- Asymmetric information is when one side of the market (buyers/ sellers) has more information than the other
- This results in a distortion of incentives and inefficient market outcomes
#### Adverse selection (knowledgeable sellers and uninformed buyers)
- There is asymmetric information in the second-hand car market
	- The seller knows more about the quality of the car they are selling that the buyers
- The price offered by buyers in the second-hand car market is based on whether thy think they are being sold a high or low quality car
	- If they know that the car is of high quality, there are willing to pay a high price
	- If they know that the car is of poor quality, they are willing to pay a low price
- The price that sellers are willing to accept is based on the quality of the car, which they know
	- If the car is of high quality, they will only accept a high price
	- If the car is of low quality, they will accept a low price
- Consumers do not know if the car is of high or low quality
	- If they assume half the cars are of high quality, and half of the cars are of low quality, they will offer and average price
	- Sellers of high quality cars are not willing to accept this price, and will not offer their cars for sale and leave the market
	- Sellers of low quality cars are willing to accept this price, and will join the market
- As the quality of cars for sale deteriorates, the average price that consumers are willing to offer will fall
	- More and more sellers of high quality cars will leave the market, and the market will be dominated by low-quality cars
	- This is known as the adverse selection problem
- In the worst case, all of the cars sold and bought are of low-quality
	- The market for high-quality cars disappears, resulting in a missing market
	- Consumers who want to buy high-quality cars and sellers who want to sell high-quality cars will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sale of high-quality cars, where buyers and sellers are matched in the market
	- But, the high-quality cars are driven out of the market by low-quality cars due to asymmetric information
	- The potential net benefit to society from having some high-quality cars is lost, and societies welfare is not maximized, causing allocative inefficiency
#### Adverse selection (uninformed sellers and knowledgeable buyers)
- There is asymmetric information in the insurance market
	- A person who buys insurance knows more about their risks and needs for insurance more than an insurance firm knows
- There are two kinds of customers, high-cost customers with high medical expenses, and low-cost customers with low medical expenses
- The insurance company is unable to distinguish between high-cost and low-cost customers but it must charge a price for insurance
	- It assumes that half of the customers are high cost and half of the customers are low cost, and offers coverage at an average cost
	- But, this price is higher that what low-cost customers are willing to pay, and they will leave the market
	- This price is lower than what high-cost customers are willing to pay, and they will join the market
- With more high-cost customers buying insurance, the cost of insurance will rise, and so will the price they charge
	- More low-cost customers drop out of the market and the market will be dominated by high-cost customers
- In the extreme case, all of the customers are high-cost customers
	- The market for low-cost customers disappears, resulting in a missing market
	- Low-cost customers who desire to buy the insurance and producers who desire to sell insurance will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales to low-cost customers, where buyers and sellers are matched in the market
	- But,  the low-cost customers are driven out of the market due to asymmetric information
	- The potential net benefit to society from having some sales to low-cost customers is lost, and societies welfare is not maximized, causing allocative inefficiency
#### Moral hazard
- Moral hazard is when economic agents take greater risks/ act less carefully than they normally would becuase the resulting costs will not be borne by them
- Moral stems from asymmetric information between a buyer and a seller after a transaction has completed
- It can arise when a party to a contract changes their behavior as a consequence of a contract

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Insurance may cause people to take greater risks becuase they know the costs of undesirable outcomes of taking risks will be borne by insurance companies
>- A person may be very casual about locking their doors to their house after buying theft insurance
>- Therefore this changes the risk the insurance company thought they were thinking based on the buyers history of no burglary

- When the insured party takes unobserved action (not observed by the insurer -> no information), it increases the probability of the event that triggers payment
- This will drive up the insurer's cost to the point where it is no longer profitable, and the service will no longer be provided as there is insufficient incentives (profits)
- Thus, there is a missing market for the service
---
- Moral hazard can also result in a principal-agent problem, where one person (agent) performs action on behalf of another (principal)
- If the actions of the agent cannot be perfectly monitored, the agent may take on more risk or put in lesser effort than desired by the principal
- E.g. A worker may slack off at work if the boss is not looking
- Mutually advantageous trade may not take place, resulting in a missing market
- The potential net benefit to society from having these goods and services traded is lost, and societies' welfare is not maximized, resulting in allocative inefficiency 
#### Supplier-induced demand
- If a producer has more information than the consumer, a situation of supplier-induced demand may arise where consumers may buy more goods/ services than what is optimal
- P: Point out the source of market failure
	- A doctor may know more about the health of a patient and the relevance of treatments and health checks than the patient
	- Lacking expertise, the patients are more likely to listen to the doctors for advice when deciding how much healthcare services they are likely to consume
	- Profit motivated doctors may then make patients believe that certain non-essential treatments or tests are needed
	
![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- This causes the patient's perceived MPB to be higher than the actual MPB
	- Consumers would base their consumption decisions based on the true MPB of healthcare, thus the perceived MPB curve is also the demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the true MPB curve is the same as the MSB curve, and the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is the same as the supply curve
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Left to market forces, market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
	- The socially optimal output is $Q*$, where MSC = MSB, and societies' welfare is maximized
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- There overconsumption of healthcare of $Q - Q^*$ units
	- For $Q - Q^*$ units, the MSC is greater than the MSB
	- There is a net loss to societies welfare from these additional units consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- The total social cost of consuming $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $A+B$
	- The total social benefit of consuming $Q - Q^*$ units is given by area $B$
	- The deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units is given by area $A$
	- Therefore there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximized
## Factor immobility
- Factor immobility refers to the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between different uses or locations
- There are two types; geographical immobility and occupational mobility
### Occupational labor immobility
1. Lack of skills and knowledge acquired from training and knowledge (e.g. becoming a doctor requires training to learn needed specialized skills and knowledge)
2. Lack of natural talent - (e.g. chefs needs a sharp palate, among other natural qualities)
3. Barriers imposed by professional associations - trade unions and professional associations can make it difficult for outsiders to enter an industry
	- E.g. recognizing qualification from certain universities only, or require a person to be a member first in order to obtain employment
### Geographical labor immobility
1. Families and other social ties - A person may not be willing to relocate and take a job in another city as they do not want to be separated from family and friends
2. Costs of moving - Costs of selling and buying a house, removal expenses, etc.
3. Differences in cost of living - Cost of living is higher in cities than in rural areas
---
- Factor immobility results in unemployment and hence wastage of resources
- The economy will be producing at a point inside the PPC, and it is productively inefficient, which is a prerequisite for allocative efficiency
- For example, with an aging population, there will be falling demand for education and rise in demand for healthcare
- This raises the price and profitability of healthcare, and healthcare providers wish to increase the quantity supplied, and would increase their demand for labor
- The falling demand for education will decrease the demand for teachers, causing them to be retrenched
- These unemployed people with job-specific skills do not have the relevant skills to take up jobs available in the healthcare industry, and will remain unemployed
- The healthcare industry is not able to get the labor needed to increase supply to meet the rise in demand, and cannot produce at the socially optimal level of output
- This results in welfare loss
## Public goods
- ==A public good is a good that is non-excludable, non-rivalrous and non-rejectable==
- Non-excludability means that it is impossible or very costly to prevent someone who has not paid from consuming the good
- Non-rivalrous means that consumption of the good by one person does not diminish the availability of the good for another
	- Consumption of the goods does not incur any additional costs
	- The marginal cost of providing for an additional user is zero
- Non-rejectability means that consumers cannot refuse the consumption of a good once it has been produced

>[!EXAMPLE]
>National defence is a public good
>- It is non-excludable as everyone in a country will enjoy the defence regardless of whether they paid for it - it is impossible to selectively defend only certain people in a country
>- National defence is also non-rivalrous because when one person consumers national defence, it does not reduce the level of defence available for others in the country
>- National defence is non-rejectable, because when deterrence to external threats is created by the provision of national defence, a person in the country will not be able to refuse the safety created even if he wants to

- Since public goods are non-excludable, producers cannot exclude those who have not paid from consuming the good
- Consumers can be free riders that benefit from a good or service without paying for it
- Therefore, no consumer would be willing to pay for public goods
- There is no effective demand in the market, since consumers are not willing to pay
- With no demand, producers will be unable to sell their good at any positive price level and thus will not be able to earn revenue from the cost of production
- Hence, when left to the free market, there will be no production of public goods and total market failure occurs
- The potential net benefit to society from having some level of public goods is lost, resulting in allocative inefficency
