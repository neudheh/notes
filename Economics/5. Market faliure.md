## Externalities
- ==An externality is a positive or negative impact on a third party on a third party not involved in the consumption or production of a good or service==
- A positive externality is a beneficial impact on a third party not involved in the economic transaction
- A negative externality is an adverse impact on a third party not involved in the economic transaction
### Positive
**Point out the source of market failure**
- Vaccines benefit the individuals getting vaccinated as they are less likely to be infected (private benefit)
- But, the people around them are also less likely to fall ill and incur lesser healthcare bills (social benefit)
- They will enjoy a positive externally in consumption, which is an external benefit to third parties not involved in the consumption of the good
>[!NOTE]
>Remember to include where the extenality is happening (consumption or production)

![[positive externality.png]]
**Divergence**
- The positive externality causes MSB to be greater than MPB, as MSB includes MPB and MEB
- This causes the MSB curve to be higher than the MPB curve, and the MEB is the vertical distance between the curves
**Social + Market equilibrium
- Under the free market, consumers will base their consumption decisions on their MPB, and ignore the external benefits
- Assuming no negative externalities, MPC = MSC
- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output would be $Q$, where demand equals supply
- But, the socially optimal output would be $Q^*$, where MSB equals MSC
**Allocative efficiency**
- Hence, there is underconsumption of immunisation by $Q^*-Q$ units, resulting in welfare loss
- For $Q-Q^*$, MSB is greater than MSC, and there is a gain to society's welfare if $Q^*-Q$  units were consumed
**Deadweight loss**
- Total social benefits: Area $A+B$
- Total social cost: Area $B$
- Deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units: Area $A$
### Negative
**Point out the source of market failure**
- The production of electricity by burning coal imposes a cost to producers as they have to pay for factors of production (e.g. coal) (private cost)
- But it produces air pollution, which causes healthcare problems to third parties, causing them to incur healthcare bills (external cost)
- Hence, there is a negative externality in the production of electricity, which is an external cost to third parties not involved in the production the good
![[Negative externality.png]]
**Divergence**
- The negative externality causes the MSC to be greater than the MPC curve, since MSC includes MPC and MEC
- This causes the MSC curve to be higher than the MPC curve, and MEC is the vertical distance between the curves
**Social + Market equilibrium**
- Under the free market, producers would base their decision on their MPC, and disregard any external costs
- Assuming no positive externalities, MSB = MPB
- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output would be $Q$, where demand equals supply
- But, the socially optimal output would be $Q^*$, where MSB equals MSC
**Allocative efficiency**
- Hence, there is overproduction of electricity by $Q-Q^*$ units, resulting in welfare loss to society
- For $Q-Q*$ units, MSC is greater than MSB, and there is a loss to society's welfare from these units produced
**Deadweight loss**
- Total social benefit: Area $E$
- Total social cost: Area $D+E$
- Deadweight loss of producing $Q$ units: $D$
## Imperfect information
- Occurs when potential buyers/ sellers have incomplete, inaccurate, uncertain, limited info, causing them to make wrong choices, leading to market failure
### Underestimation of true private benefits
**Point out the source of market failure**
- Healthcare can benefit one's health and well-being, such as being less likely to have health complications
- But, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these long-term gains and underestimate the benefits that consuming healthcare provides
![[Imperfect info benefits.png]]
**Divergence**
- The underestimation of benefits by the consumer causes the perceived MPB to be lower than that of the true MPB
- Consumers would base their consumption decision based on their perceived MPB, hence, the perceived MPB curve is also the demand curve
**Social + Market equilibrium**
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve is the same as the true MPB curve, and the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Left to market forces, market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
- But, the socially optimal output is at $Q^*$, where MSB equals MSC
**Allocative efficiency**
- There is an underconsumption of healthcare of $Q^*-Q$ units
- For $Q^*-Q$ units, the MSB is greater than the MSC, and there is additional gain to society's welfare if $Q^*-Q$ units were consumed
**Deadweight loss**
- Total social benefit: Area $M+N$
- Total social cost: Area $N$
- Deadweight loss due of consuming $Q$ units: $M$

### Overestimation of true private benefits
**Point out the source of market failure**
- Cigarettes can cause long-term harm to one's health and well-being, such as causing lung cancer
- But, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these harms about smoking, and overestimate the true value that smoking provides
![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
**Divergence**
- Consumers would base their consumptions decision on their perceived MPB, hence the perceived MPB curve is also the demand curve
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the true MPB curve, and the MSC curve will be the same as MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
**Social + Market equilibrium**
- Left to market forces, market equilibrium quantity will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
- But, socially optimal output will be at $Q^*$, where MSB equals MSC
**Allocative efficiency**
- There is overconsumption of cigarettes of $Q-Q^*$ units
- For $Q-Q^*$ units, MSB is lower than MSC, and there is a loss to society's welfare from these additional units of cigarettes consumed
**Deadweight loss**
- Total social benefit: Area $B$
- Total social cost: Area $A+B$
- Deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units: Area $A$
## Asymmetric information
- Asymmetric information is when one side of the market (buyers or seller), has better information than the other
- The information available to buyer and seller differs, resulting in a distortion of incentives and inefficient market outcomes
### Adverse selection
- Adverse selection is when asymmetric information between consumers and producers results in an unfavourable selection of sellers/ buyers in a market
- This leads into a missing market for a segment of other buyers/ sellers in a market, who do not get to buy or sell the good even though it is beneficial for them to do so
---
- There is asymmetric information in the second-hand car market
- The seller knows more about the quality of the car than the buyer
- The price offered by buyers in the second hand car market is based on whether they think they are being sold a high quality (cherry) or low quality car (lemon)
	- If they know that the car is a cherry, they are willing to pay a high price
	- If they know the car is a lemon, they are willing to pay a low price
- The price sellers are willing to accept is based on the quality of the car which is known to them
	- If the car is a cherry, they are are only willing to accept a high prie
	- If the car is a lemon, they are prepared to accept a low price
- Customers know that are know that there are lemons for sale, but do not know which car is a lemon
	- If they assume that half of the cars are cherries and half are lemons, they will offer an average price for a car
	- But, sellers of cherries are not willing to accept this price, and they will not offer their cars for sale and will leave the market
	- Sellers of lemons are willing to sell their cars at this average price, and will join the market
- As the quality of cars steadily deteriorates, the average price that consumers are willing to offer will fall
	- More and more sellers of cherries will leave the market, and the market will be dominated by lemons
	- This is known as the adverse selection problem
- In the worst case, all the cars sold and purchased are lemons
	- The market for cherries disappears, resulting in a missing market
	- Buyers who desire to buy cherries and producers who desire to sell cherries will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of cherries, where buyers and sellers are matched in the market
	- But, since the cherries are driven out of the market by lemons, the potential net benefit to society form having some cherries traded is lost
	- Society's welfare is not maximised and there is allocative inefficiency
### Moral hazard
- Moral hazard is where economic agents take greater risks/ act less carefully than they normally would because the resulting costs will not be borne by them
---
- Moral hazard happens when a party to a contract changes their behaviour as a consequence of the contract
- Insurance may cause people to take greater risks because the cost of undesirable outcomes of taking risks will be borne by the insurance companies
- E.g. if a person buys house insurance for theft, they may not lock the doors of their house
- This changes the risk the insurance company thought they were taking on based on the person's history of no burglary
- When the insured party takes action not observed by the insurer (no information), this increases the probability of the event that triggers payment from the insurer
- This will drive up the insurer's cost to the point that the business is no longer profitable
- The service will no longer be provided as there is not enough profits to offer it for sale, resulting in a missing market
---
- Moral hazard can also arise in a principal-agent problem, where one action (agent) does tasks on the behalf of another (principal
- If the action of the agent cannot be perfectly monitored, the agent would tent to undertake more risk or put in less effort than desired
- E.g. A worker as an agent of the employer might slack off if the boss is not looking, resulting in less then desirable results
- ---
- Moral hazard creates a lack of trust between buyers and sellers for a product, thus mutually advantageous trade might not take place, and there is thus no market for it
- The potential net benefit to society from having these goods and services traded is lost, and society's welfare is not maximised and there is allocative inefficiency
### Supplier induced demand
- If a seller has more information than the buyer, a situation of supplier induced demand may arise where consumers end up buying more goods/ services than what is optimal
**Point out the source of market failure**
- A doctor may know more about the health of a patient and the relevant treatment than the patients
- The patient will listen to the doctor for advice when deciding how much healthcare services to consume
- Profit-motivated doctors may lead patients to believe certain non-essential healthcare services or tests are required
- This causes the perceived MPB to be higher than the true MPB

![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
**Divergence**
- Consumers would base their consumptions decision on their perceived MPB, hence the perceived MPB curve is also the demand curve
- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as the true MPB curve, and the MSC curve will be the same as MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
**Social + Market equilibrium**
- Left to market forces, market equilibrium quantity will be at $Q$, where demand equals supply
- But, socially optimal output will be at $Q^*$, where MSB equals MSC
**Allocative efficiency**
- There is overconsumption of cigarettes of $Q-Q^*$ units
- For $Q-Q^*$ units, MSB is lower than MSC, and there is a loss to society's welfare from these additional units of cigarettes consumed
**Deadweight loss**
- Total social benefit: Area $B$
- Total social cost: Area $A+B$
- Deadweight loss of consuming $Q$ units: Area $A$
## Factor immobility
- ==Factor immobility is to the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between different uses or locations==
- Occupational immobility is the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between occupations or industries
	- Lack of skills or knowledge
	- Lack of natural talent
	- Barriers imposed by professional associates/ trade unions, making it difficult for outsiders to enter an industry (e.g. licences, graduate from a certain university)
- Geographical immobility is the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between occupations or industries
	- Family and other social ties
	- Costs of moving
	- Differences in cost of living
- Factor immobility results in unemployment and hence wastage of resources
- The economy will be producing inside the PPC, hence it is productively inefficient, which is a prerequisite for allocative efficiency
- For example, with an aging population, there will be falling demand for education and increasing demand for healthcare
- This raises the price and hence profitability of healthcare
- Healthcare producers will want to increase quantity supplied, and will increase their demand for nurses
- The falling demand for education will decrease the demand for teachers and they may be retrenched
- They unemployed teachers with job-specific skills do not have the relevant skills to take up jobs available in the healthcare industry and will remain unemployed
- The healthcare industry is also not able to get the desired amount of labor needed to increase quantity supplied to meet the rise in demand
- Thus, they cannot produce at the socially optimal level of healthcare, resulting in welfare loss
## Public goods
- ==A public goods is a good that is non-excludable, non-rivalrous, and non-rejectable==
- Non-excludable means that it is impossible or very costly to prevent someone who has not paid from consuming the good
- Non-rivalrous means that consumption of the good by one person does not diminish the availability of the good for another person
- This implies that the marginal cost of providing an additional user is zero, but it does not mean the MC of producing the good is zero
- Non-rejectability means that there is an inability of consumers to reduce the consumption of the good once it has been provided
---
- As public goods are non-excludable, it is impossible for producers to exclude those who have not paid from consuming the good
- This means that consumers can be free riders that benefit from a good or service without paying for it, and no consumer would be willing to pay for public goods
- Hence, there is not effective demand in the market since consumers are not willing to pay for public goods
- With no demand, producers will be unable to sell the good at any positive price level and thus will not be able to earn revenue to cover the cost of production
- Hence, there will be no production of public goods and total market failure occurs
- The potential net benefit to society from having some level of public goods produced and consumed is lost, resulting in allocative inefficiency
