- When a market fails to allocate resources efficiently, the market equilibrium quantity is not allocative efficient, and there is over or under production/ consumption of some goods and services
- In some cases, some goods and services may not even be produced
## Externalities
- An externality refers to a positive/ negative impact on a third party not involved in the consumption or production of a good/ service
### Positive
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- People who consume vaccines benefits by decreasing their likelihood of being infected
	- Third parties such as their family will be less likely to fall ill, as the person who consumed it will be less likely to fall ill, even though they did not consume vaccines
	- They enjoy a positive externality from the consumption of vaccines, which is an external benefit to third parties not formed in the consumption of the good
	
>[!NOTE]
>remember to include where the externality is!!! consumption or production?

- D: Divergence
	- The positive externality causes the MSB to be greater than the MPB
	- This is because MSB = MPB + MEB
	- This causes the MSB curve to be higher than the MPB curve, where the MEB is the distance between the two
	- Assuming no negative externalities, MPC = MSC
- S: Social equilibrium + Market equilibrium
	- Under the free market, consumers will base their consumption decisions on their MPB, and disregard the external benefits
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where DD = SS and market equilibrium price will be at $P$
	- But, socially optimal output and price is at $Q*$ and $P*$, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximised
- A: Allocative efficiency
	- There is underconsumption of immunisation by $Q* - Q$ units, resulting in welfare loss
	- This is because for $Q$ to $Q*$, MSB > MSC, and there is a gain society's welfare if $Q* - Q$) units were consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- Total social benefits -> Area $A +B$ 
	- Total social costs -> Area $B$
	- DWL -> Area $A$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
### Negative
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- The production of electricity by burning coal imposes a cost on producers as they have to pay for factors of production like raw materials (e.g. coal)
	- It also producers air pollution, which causes health problems for third parties as they inhale the polluted air and have to incur medical expenses
	- They suffer a negative externality in production of electricity, which is an external cost to third parties not involved in the production of the goods
![[Negative externality.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The negative externality causes the MSC to the greater than the MSB
	- This is because MSC = MPC + MEC
	- This cases the MSC curve to be higher than the MPC curve, where the MEC is the distance between the two
	- Assuming no positive externalities, MPB = MSB
- S: Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- Under the free market, producers will base their production decisions on their MPC and disregard the external costs
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where DD = SS, and the market equilibrium price will be at $P$
	- The socially optimal output and price is at $Q*$ and $P*$, where MSB = MSC and society's welfare is maximised
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- This results from over production of electricity of $Q - Q*$ units
	- Tis is because for $Q$ to $Q*$ units, MSC > MSB, and there is a loss to society because $Q - Q*$ units were produced
- D: Deadweight loss
	- Total social benefits -> Area $E$
	- Total social costs -> Area $D + E$
	- DWL -> area $D$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
## Imperfect information
- Occurs when potential buyers/ sellers have incomplete/ inaccurate/ uncertain/ limited info, causing them to possibly make wrong choices, leading to market failure
### Consumer ignorance 

#### Underestimation of true private benefits
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- Preventive healthcare (e.g. health screenings) can reduce the likelihood of future health complications in the future
	- But, due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these long term gains and under estimate the true benefits that consuming healthcare provides
![[Imperfect info benefits.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The under-estimation of benefits by the consumer causes the perceived MPB to the lower than the true MPB of consuming healthcare
	- Consumers would base their consumption decisions on their perceived MPB, and hence the perceived MPB curve is also the market demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve is the same as the True MPB curve, and the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- S: Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where DD= SS
	- The socially optimal output is at $Q*$, where MSC = MSB and society's welfare is maximised
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- There is underconsumption of healthcare of $Q*- Q$ units
	- For $Q*$ to $Q$ units, the MSB > MSC, and there is additional gain to society's welfare that can be reaped if more healthcare is consumed
- D: Deadweight loss
	- Total social benefits -> Area $M+N$
	- Total social costs -> Area $N$
	- Deadweight loss -> Area $M$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
#### Underestimation of true private costs
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
	- Smoking causes long-term harm to one's own health and well being (e.g. lung cancer)
	- Due to imperfect information, consumers may be ignorant about these harms from smoking, and over-estimate the true value that smoking provides
![[Overestimation of benefits.png]]
- D: Divergence
	- The over-estimation of the true value of smoking causes the MPB to be higher than the true MPB
	- Consumers would base their consumption decisions on their perceived MPB, and hence the perceived MPB curve is also the market demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve is the same as the True MPB curve, and the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- S: Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- Left to market forces, the market equilibrium output will be at $Q$, where DD = SS
	- The socially optimal output will be at $Q*$, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
- A: Allocative inefficiency
	- There is overconsumption of $Q* - Q$ units
	- For $Q*$ to $Q$ units, the MSC > MSB, and there is an additional loss that is bored by society from consuming $Q* - Q$ units
- D: Deadweight loss
	- Total social benefits -> Area $B$
	- Total social costs -> Area $(A + B$)
	- DWL -> Area $A$
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
### Asymmetric information 
- ==Asymmetric information occurs when one side of the market, either buyers or sellers, has better information than the other==
- The information available to the buyer and seller differs, resulting in a distortion of incentives and inefficient market outcomes
#### Adverse selection (Knowledgeable sellers and uninformed buyers)
- Adverse selection is a situation in which asymmetric information between consumers and producers results in an unfavourable selection of products/ buyers participating in a market
- This leads to a missing market for a segment of other buyers/ seller, who do not get to buy or sell the goods, even though it is beneficial for them to do so
- Adverse selection occurs before the transaction has been completed

- A lemon is a poor quality product, such as a second hand car that needs frequent repairs
- There is asymmetric information in the second hand car market, as the seller knows more about the quality if the car they are selling than the buyers

- Consumers know that there are low quality cars being offered for sale, but they do not know which particular car is of low or high quality
- They will assume that half the cars are of high quality and half are of low quality, and they will be prepared to offer only an average price for a car
- Sellers of high-quality cars are not prepared to accept this average price, and will not offer their cars for sale and leave the market
- Seller of low-quality cars are willing to sell their cars at the average price and will join the market

- As the quality of the cars slowly deteriorates, the average price that consumers are willing to offer will fall
- More and more sellers of high quality cars will leave the market, and the market will be increasingly dominated by lemons, in a phenomena known as the adverse selection problem

- In the extreme case, all cars sold and purchased in the used-car market are lemons
- The market for cherries disappears, resulting in a missing market
- Consumers who desired to buy the cherry and producers who desire to sell the cherry will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of good quality cars, where willing buyers and sellers are matched in the market
- However, since the producers of high quality cars are driven out of the market by low quality cars due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit from having some good-quality cars traded is lost
- Society's welfare is not maximised, resulting in allocative inefficiency
#### Adverse selection (Uninformed sellers and knowledgeable buyers)
- There is asymmetric information in the insurance market, as a person who buys a health insurance policy knows much more about his/ her risks and needs for insurance than the insurance firm 
- There are high-cost customers with high medical expenses (fall ill frequently), and low cost customers with low medical expenses (fall ill rarely)

- The insurance company is unable to distinguish between high cost and low cost customers, but it must charge a price for its insurance
- If the insurance company assumes half its customers are high-cost and half are low-cost, it will offer coverage at a prices that is equal to the average cost of providing insurance coverage
- However, this price would be higher than what low-cost customers are willing to pay, and they will drop out of the insurance market
- On the other hand, this price is lower that what high-cost customers are prepared to pay, and more high-cost customers join the market

- With increasingly more high-cost customers buying insurance, the average cost of insurance companies rises, and the average price that insurance companies charge slowly rises
- More low-cost customers drop out of the market, and the market will be increasingly be dominated by high cost customers

- In the extreme case, only high cost customers are left in the insurance market
- The market for insurance for low-cost customers disappears, resulting in a missing market
- Low-cost customers who desire to buy the goods and producers who desire to sell the good to low-cost customers will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of insurance to low-cost customers, where willing buyers and sellers are matched int he market
- However, since low costs customers are driven out of the market due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit to society from having some low-cost customers insured is lost
- Society welfare is not maximised, resulting in allocative inefficiency
#### Moral hazard
- 
#### Supplier-induced demand
- P: Point out the sources of market failure
- D: Divergence
- S: Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
- A: Allocative inefficiency
- D: Deadweight loss
	- Therefore, there is allocative inefficiency as society's welfare is not maximised
