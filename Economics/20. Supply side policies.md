- Supply side policies are polices that increase the productivity and efficiency to the economy
- These policies
	- Increase the quantity/ quality of factors of production
	- Reduce the unit cost of production
	- Improve factor mobility
	- Increase efficiency and remove barriers to competition
## Effects of supply side policies
### Increase the productive capacity of the economy
- To achieve sustained economic growth, governments use supply side policies that increase the productivity and efficiency of the economy to increase productive capacity
- These cause AD to increase, which is shown by a rightward shift in vertical AS from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
- Economies that were near or at full employment would enjoy a fall in the GPL
- There would also be an increase in real GDP through the wealth, interest rate, and international substitution effect
- This would help to alleviate inflation

### Decrease the UCOP of an economy
- To generate actual growth and address cost-push inflation, governments use supply side polices that reduce the unit cost of production
- This will cause the horizontal portion of the AS curve to shift downwards from $AS_3$ to $AS_4$
- Firms will pass on the cost savings by lowering the price of their goods and services
- Economies operating with spare capacity will experience actual growth through the wealth, interest rate, and international substitution effect
### Reduce unemployment
- Some policies help to reduce structural unemployment
- Policies such as skill retraining reduces structural unemployment by increasing the occupation mobility of workers
- By equipping retrenched workers with the relevant skills, skills mismatch is reduced, hence structural unemployment is reduced
### Improve balance of trade
- Supply side policies that increase AS and hence lower prices in the economy would help to make exports price competitive
- Assuming demand for exports is price elastic, a fall in the price of exports would lead to a rise in export revenue, leading to an improvement in BOT
## Policies that increase the quantity of factors of production
### Labor
**Raising the retirement age or re-employment age**
- This policy increases the number of people who can remain employed, and thus the workforce is expanded
- Extending the retirement age means that firms are obliged to keep their older workers in employment for a longer period
- This maintains the size of the labor force as extending the retirement age may encourage those who have already retired to return to the labor force

**Removing barriers to labor flows**
- To increase the quantity of labor, the government can loosen its immigration policy, increasing the quantity of labor, which increase productive capacity
- However, this may have unintended consequences
- It may result in overcrowding on public transport and housing if social infrastructure is not ready to accommodate an influx of foreigners
- If may also slow down restructuring of the economy as firms are less likely to adopt efficient capital-intensive methods of production when low-cost labor is available
- This can slow down potential growth due to weak productivity growth

**Reducing income tax**
- Lower income tax increases individulas disposable income
- This provides an incentive for people to work longer hours and join the labor force
- It may also attract more foreigners to join the labor force
- Thus, quantity of labor rises, causing productive capacity to rise
- If highly skilled foreign talents are attracted by the lower income tax rates, the quality of labor will improve as well
- Assuming wages remain constant, this will result in a fall in UCOP
### Capital
**Reducing corporate tax**
- Reducing corporate tax would increase capital stock as it can increase local investment and FDI
- Firms will find it more attractive to invest as they can retain a relatively larger portion of their profits, and they enjoy a higher post-tax expected rate of return on investments
- This will increase the quality of capital and productive capacity will rise
- But, governments with budget deficits and have a high level of public debt cannot cut corporate tax as it will result in larger budget deficits
- Cutting corporate tax can lead to income inequality, as owner of firms are typically the wealthier households who have funds to buy shares in companies
- Cuts in taxes would lead to more dividends (distributed profits) for shareholder, leading to greater income inequality

**Removing/ reducing restrictions to capital flows**
- The government can remove or reduce current restrictions imposed on FDIs
- With the absence of these barriers, foreign firms would find it easier and more profitable to invest in different sectors of the economy, bringing much needed skills, tech, and capital
- This would directly increase the quantity of capital, leading to a rise in the productive capacity
- The quality of capital may also improve
- As investment expenditure on capital goods is a component of AD, and increase in FDI would lead to a rise in AD
- With both AD and AS rising, there is sustained economic growth
- However, heavy reliance on FDI may make an economy susceptible to external shocks, because FDI might suddenly pull out, affecting employment and economic growth
- FDI leads to structural change in the economy, resulting in structural unemployment and rising income inequality

**Government spending on infrastructure**
- Governments can directly increase the quantity of capital by increasing the quantity of infrastructure (e.g. highways, railways)
- This would increase the capital stock and the productive capacity of the economy increases
- The government spending on domestically produced goods and services is also a part of AD, hence both AD and AS are rising, achieving sustained economic growth
- These infrastructure can also help firms reduce costs and improve efficiency, lowering unit costs of production for the whole economy, increasing AS
- But, this can take years to complete
## Policies that improve the quality of factors of production
### Labor
**Subsidizing or direct provision of education**
- The government can subsidize education, or intervene by directly providing it
- It can set up vocational and tertiary institutions focusing on technical education
- Education improves the quality of human capital, increasing productivity
- This increase the country's productive capacity
- Assuming that wages remain constant. the increase in labor productivity would also lead to a fall in UCOP
- A better educated workforce would also attract more FDI
- This would cause I to rise, increasing AD
- As AD and AS are both rising, there is sustained growth
- However, education has a very long gestation period and it may take many years for it to have any effect
- The positive impact will only be experienced years after the policy is implemented
- The skills taught now may also not be relevant in the future

**Subsidizing training and upgrading of skills**
- The government can also provide training facilities or subsidies to encourage workers to go for further training and upgrade themselves
- This would raise the quality of workers, as they can generate more output per man hour, making them more productive
- This will increase the productive capacity and cause AS to increase
- Assuming wages remain constant, the increase in labor productivity will also decrease the UCOP within the country
- Private firms may not provide sufficient vocational training, because workers may leave them and join their competitors
- However, subsidizing training can put a strain on the government budget
- There is also great resistance in learning new skills, especially among older workers would might be reluctant to train or are unable to train, thus it will take time
- But, subsidizing or directly provision of education and skills upgrading would increase labor productivity and lead to a rise in demand for labor
- People can get more jobs or earn higher wages, improving income distribution, thus there is inclusive growth
### Capital
**Encouraging R&D**
- Governments can also provide grants subsidies and/or tax incentives to firms to encourage R&D
- These policies lower the marginal cost of conducting R&D, incentivizing firms
- With more R&D, there will be greater innovation and advancements in technology, which improves the quality of capital, increasing productive capacity
- But, success of R&D is not guaranteed, and it would usually take years for it to be completed and contribute to the economy
- Moreover, R&D without the proper intellectual property rights in place is to a large extent non-excludable
- There is nothing to prevent a firms rivals from copying and using the technology and innovation that it has developed

## Policies that reduce the cost of production
### Improving productivity of workers
- Policies that improve the quality of the workers, such as subsidies to encourage workers to go for training would enable workers to achieve higher productivity
- They can produce more output per man hour
- Assuming no change in wage rates, higher labor productivity translates into lower unit costs of production
### Controlling prices
- In times of imported deflation or sudden depreciation, the government can use price controls to alleviate cost-push inflation
- A government can set price ceilings (maximum prices below prevailing market prices) on factors of production to lower the unit cost of production of the economy
- However, this will create a shortage as the price cannot rise to clear the shortage at the current price level, resulting in allocative inefficiency
### Controlling wages
- The government can remove minimum wages and reduce the power of trade unions
- Removing the minimum wage allows the labor market to function more efficiently, as wage rates will be reduced to the equilibrium wage rate, lowering the unit cost of production for firms
- Trade unions may bargain for wage increases that are higher than worker's productivity growth
- This results in a higher unit cost of production, leading to cost-push inflation
- The government can temper the trade unions ability to demand for higher wages or resist wage cuts
- E.g. they can introduce more flexible wage models that allow employers to more easily reduce wages in a recession
- When firms can cut wages in a recession, there is lesser need for them to retrench workers, preventing the severity of demand-deficient unemployment in a recession
- This would also lower unit cost of production
- However, the removal or reduction of the minimum wage is very unpopular
- But, the removal of wage controls increases the efficiency of labor as the surplus of labor created by the minimum wage is cleared, achieving allocative efficiency
## Policies that improve mobility of factors of production
- Workers who are retrenched by do not have the skills required to join growing industries may become structurally unemployed
- Government subsidies for training and skills upgrading allow retrenched workers to equip themselves with new skills
- They will be more mobile between occupations and then can find new jobs within growth industries, reducing structural unemployment
