## Actual and potential growth
- ==Actual economic growth is the increase in actual national output==
- Actual national output is the equilibrium real national output
- Formula: $$Actual\ GDP\ growth\ rate = \frac{GDP_{t} - GDP_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \times 100\%$$
- Real GDP is used in this calculation
- A countries' actual growth rate indicates whether the country's national output is rising or shrinking over time and how rapidly the country's actual national output is rising
- ==A recession is when there is negative actual growth for two consecutive quarters==
- ==Potential growth is the increase in the capacity (potential) of the economy to produce==
- In other words, it refers to an expansion in a county's potential national output (full employment national output)
## Tools of analysis for economic growth
### PPC
- When a country moves from a point inside the PPC to a point closer to or on the PPC, it is producing more of both goods, and there is actual economic growth
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the economy's productive capacity, i.e. there has be potential economic growth
- When there are changes in quantity and/ or quality of resources or level of technology, there would be a shift in the PPC
### AD-AS
- When the equilibrium real national output increases, there is actual economic growth
- When the vertical part of AS shifts rightwards, there is potential economic growth
## Factors affecting actual growth
### Increase in AD
- The components of AD are 
	- Planned consumption expenditure (C)
	- Investment expenditure (I)
	- Government expenditure (G)
	- Net Exports (X-M)
- If AD increases due to a rise in any of its components, equilibrium real national output will increase, resulting in actual growth, assuming there is spare capacity in the economy
- The rise in AD will create shortages and cause an unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to increase production by hiring more FOPs.
- Through the multiplier process, there will be a multiplied increase in real GDP
### Increase in SRAS
- When there is a decrease in unit costs of production, short-run AS (SRAS) increases
- The horizontal portion of the AS curve will shift leftwards, causing equilibrium real GDP to increase from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, thus there is actual growth
- The rise in AS will lead to a fall in the general price level, and through the wealth/ international substitution/ real balances effect, and equilibrium national output rises
## Factors affecting potential growth
- When the countries has an increase in the quantity or quality of its factors of production (FOPs), long-run AS increases
- The vertical portion of the AS shifts right, causing potential national output to increase from $Yf_1$ to $Yf_2$, thus there is potential growth
## Factors affecting quantity of FOPs

### Capital
### Labour
### Land
### Entrepreneurs

## Factors affecting quality of FOPs
## Sustained economic growth
