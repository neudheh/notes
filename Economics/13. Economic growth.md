## Actual and potential growth
- ==Actual economic growth is the increase in actual national output==
- Actual national output is the equilibrium real national output
- Formula: $$Actual\ GDP\ growth\ rate = \frac{GDP_{t} - GDP_{t-1}}{GDP_{t-1}} \times 100\%$$
- Real GDP is used in this calculation
- A countries' actual growth rate indicates whether the country's national output is rising or shrinking over time and how rapidly the country's actual national output is rising
- ==A recession is when there is negative actual growth for two consecutive quarters==
- ==Potential growth is the increase in the capacity (potential) of the economy to produce==
- In other words, it refers to an expansion in a county's potential national output (full employment national output)
## Tools of analysis for economic growth
### PPC
- When a country moves from a point inside the PPC to a point closer to or on the PPC, it is producing more of both goods, and there is actual economic growth
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the economy's productive capacity, i.e. there has be potential economic growth
- When there are changes in quantity and/ or quality of resources or level of technology, there would be a shift in the PPC
### AD-AS
- When the equilibrium real national output increases, there is actual economic growth
- When the vertical part of AS shifts rightwards, there is potential economic growth
## Factors affecting actual growth
### Increase in AD
- The components of AD are 
	- Planned consumption expenditure (C)
	- Investment expenditure (I)
	- Government expenditure (G)
	- Net Exports (X-M)
- If AD increases due to a rise in any of its components, equilibrium real national output will increase, resulting in actual growth, assuming there is spare capacity in the economy
- The rise in AD will create shortages and cause an unplanned fall in inventories, causing firms to increase production by hiring more FOPs.
- Through the multiplier process, there will be a multiplied increase in real GDP
### Increase in SRAS
- When there is a decrease in unit costs of production, short-run AS (SRAS) increases
- The horizontal portion of the AS curve will shift leftwards, causing equilibrium real GDP to increase from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, thus there is actual growth
- The rise in AS will lead to a fall in the general price level, and through the wealth/ international substitution/ real balances effect, and equilibrium national output rises
## Factors affecting potential growth
- When the countries has an increase in the quantity or quality of its factors of production (FOPs), long-run AS increases
- The vertical portion of the AS shifts right, causing potential national output to increase from $Yf_1$ to $Yf_2$, thus there is potential growth
## Factors affecting quantity of FOPs
### Capital
- A country's capital stock is its collection of durable assets (i.e. production plants. equipment) that is used for producing other goods and services.
- A country's capital stock can increase through investment and shrink through capital depreciation
- As long as net investment is positive, capital stock will increase over time ($Net\ investment = Gross\ investment - Capital\ Depreciation$)
- When a country has more capital stock, it will be able to generate more output of goods and services, increasing the productive capacity of the economy
- Investment can be domestic or foreign
#### Domestic
- Refers to investment by domestic firms
- Affected by
	- The country's level of saving - Investment requires saving so that resources can be channelled towards towards the production of capital good, and away from the producing of consumer goods
	- The interest rate (cost of borrowing)
	- Entrepreneur's level of confidence about the future business and economy outlook of the economy
	- Corporate tax rate
#### Foreign
- Refers to investment by foreign firms
- Affected by 
	- Entrepreneur's level of confidence about the future business and economy outlook of the economy
	- Corporate tax rate
	- Exchange rate stability
	- Ease of doing business
### Labor
- The quantity of labor can change in two ways
	- **Average working hours per hour** increases -> economy can produce more goods and services using the same number of workers
	- When the **size of labor force** increases, ceteris paribus, will increase a countries national output
- The labor force refers the manpower currently available in the economy, comprising of people who are working or seeking work)
- The size of the labor force depends on
#### Changes in population size or structure 
- Changes in population size can occur due to changes in birth rates/ death rates, or migration
- With a larger population size, the size of the labor force would likely be larger
- A country that is facing an ageing population would have fewer young workers joining the labor force, compared to the number of older workers that are retiring
- The size of the labor force decreases overall
#### Foreign labor
- The inflow of foreign workers depends on the attractiveness of work in the host country, and government policy towards migrant labor
### Land
- A country's quantity of natural resources increases when there is discovery of new mineral deposits
- A country's national resources can become depleted when renewable resources are used at a faster rate than that of replacement
- The scope for increasing natural resources is limited besides land reclamation
- One constraint for potential growth is that there is a fixed amount of land, which can be over come by building upwards with taller buildings, or building deeper (tunnels and storage)
### Entrepreneurs
- Entrepreneurs bring different factors of production together, bear the risk of making losses in undertaking production, and undertake investment in R&D, which is needed for technological progress
- There are a number of factors that affect the number of entrepreneurs
	- Legal framework
	- Funding
	- Culture
## Factors affecting quality of FOPs
- The quality of a country's FOPs is the productivity of the FOPs (i.e. the efficiency with which FOPs are being used)
### Measures of factor productivity
#### Labor productivity
- The measure of the amount of output per unit of labor
- Measures if a country's overall labor productivity level include $$GDP\ per\ employed\ person= \frac{GDP}{Total\ employed \ people}$$$$GDP\ per\ hour\ worked= \frac{GDP}{Total\ no.\ of\ hours\ worked}$$
#### Total factor productivity
- The amount of output from a give quantity of all the inputs used in production
### Factors affecting total factor productivity
#### The level of physical capital
- Investment in physical capital increases the country's capital stock and so the overall quantity of FOP in the country
- It also increases productivity of land and labor as each unit of labor now has more capital to work with
#### The level of human capital
- Human capital is the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training, and experience
- Higher quality of human capital raises a nation's ability to produce goods and services through greater knowledge higher skills, and hence higher labor productivity
#### The level of technology
- Advancement in a country's level of technology through process innovation will enable the same quantity of FOP to produce more in the same period
- This can stem from
	- R&D conducted by private firms or the government
	- Transfer of knowledge from multi-national corporations (MNCs), especially when an MNC from a developed country establishes a branch in a developing country
- The ability of a nation to effect and sustain technological innovation depends on
	- The quality and size of the nation's education and training system
	- The level of investment into R&D
	- The existence of institutions that provide individuals with the ability and incentive to innovate and bring about technological progress
	- E.g. financial systems that enables individuals to raise funds for investment in R&D; Legal institutions that confer property rights on new inventions, allowing higher financial returns on the invention, incensing individuals/ firms to engage in R&D
## Role of the government
- Government policies are one of the key sources of potential economic growth in the economy, known as supply-side policies
- Governments subsidize education and job skills training to improve human capital, increasing productivity growth
- A government's macro-management of the economy also matters, as it affects firm's investment plans and influence their long run expectations regarding the rate of return on their investments by affecting the economic stability of the country
## Sustained economic growth
 - Sustained economic growth refers to a situation where an economy's real national output increases over an extended period, without accelerating inflation rates
 - The growth rate is at a level that is not causing the general price level to accelerate from its current levels, a situation non as non-inflationary growth, where there is a rise in real output over time
 - Without an expansion of national output, increase in equilibrium national output must eventually come to an end
 - Once spare capacity has been use up, full employment of labor and other factors has been reached growth of equilibrium national output will be restricted by the growth of potential national output
 - For sustained actual growth, potential output must continue to rise through a rise in vertical AS together with a rise in actual output through a rise in AD
