- Imperfectly competitive firms who have market power will produce at the output where $MR = MC$ and charge a price that exceeds MC
- The firms equilibrium output is lower than the social optimal level leading to welfare loss
- The extent of welfare loss in monopolistic competition is not severe due to many firms causing demand for each firm's product to be relatively price elastic
	- The monopolistic competitive market structure meets consumers desire for variety
	- The low entry barriers also meant that monopolistic competitive firms only earn normal profits in the long run, contributed to greater equity in income distribution
	- Hence, the benefits of this market structure exceed the costs, and governments do not intervene
- The high degree of market power of monopoly firms and oligopoly firms, and this could cause underproduction of their output relative to the social optimal output
	- This results in rather large welfare loss
	- This could also result in higher prices for consumers
	- The high barriers to entry makes it possible for firms to sustain their supernormal profits in the long run, contributing the the inequitable distribution of income
[[	]]- As such, governments intervene in monopolies and oligopolies that are more concentrated due to collusion to correct the problems with inefficiency and inequity
## Regulation
- Governments can apply anti-trust laws to curb anti-competitive practises, to prevent excessive market power being held by dominant firms

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Singapore enacted the Competition Act to provide a generic competition law to protect consumers and businesses from anti-competitive practises of private entities
>- It prohibits
>	1. Anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practises
>	2. Abuse of dominant position
>	3. Mergers and acquisitions that substantially reduce competition
>- It is enforced by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore, a statutory board under the Ministry of Trade and Industry
>- It ensures firm battle on a level playing field and compete through greater efficiency, lower pricing, and improved products so that consumers benefit

### Making price-fixing and predatory pricing illegal
- Firms caught price fixing (where they agree to sell a product at a specific price) and predatory pricing would be fined
- The fines they will have to pay disincentivises them from engaging in anti-competitive agreements as they may risk reducing their supernormal profit
- With the reduced market power and more competition, there is greater allocative efficiency
- Governments can use cognitive biases like loss aversion to nudge the firms against anti-competitive practises, increasing the effectiveness of the fines
- But, the effectiveness depends on the size of the fine, as a small fine may not be sufficient to disincentives them form engaging in anti-competitive behaviour
- This is especially true if there is large profit to be gained, and the effect of loss aversion may be limited, reducing the effectiveness of the fine as a deterrent
### Breaking up monopolies and disallowing mergers
- Governments can file lawsuits against monopolies that abuse their market power to break them up into smaller firms
- Governments also disallow mergers that would lead to concentration of market power by a single firms
- Firms would be forced to divest, selling off a portion of their assets to increase competition, reducing allocative inefficiency
- But, it is difficult to prove that firms are colluding or engaging in anti-competitive actions
- Rival firms may also abuse anti-trust laws to retaliate against successful firms who captured a large part of of the market because they produce a better product
- Anti-monopoly laws may also prevent firms form reaping the benefit of mergers, such as lower economies of scale leading to lower costs and prices
## Deregulation
- Governments can also open up markets by reducing barriers to entry
- This increases supply, competition and innovation, bringing lower prices for consumers
- With a reduction in market power of dominant firms, the market moves towards a more a more efficient and equitable outcome
## Regulate pricing
- When a monopolist is able to enjoy substantial EOS, the case for the continuation of the monopoly is strong since consumers potentially get to enjoy lower prices
- But, firms with market dominance tend to restrict output and produce lesser than the allocative efficient outcome, where $P=MC$
- Governments can regulate the monopolies or oligopolies' pricing to prevent abuse of market dominance
![[regulate pricing.png]]
- Consider a natural monopoly, where the profit maximising output is $Q_M$ and price is $P_M$, where $MR = MC$
- But, the allocative efficient output is at $Q_{MC}$ and $P_{MC}$, where $P=MC$
- With MC and AC falling throughout the range of the market demand curve, the underproduction of output results in an allocative efficient outcome
- The deadweight loss of underproduction of $Q_{MC} - Q_M$ units results in a welfare loss of area $abe$
- For a natural monopoly, deregulation is not an option as only one firm can produce the good/ service profitably
- It is also better for the industry to remain a monopoly so that society can enjoy the cost-advantage of a large scale production
- The natural monopoly can supply the good/ services at a lower unit cost than two ore more firms
- Thus, the government regulates the price charged by the monopolist
### MC pricing
- MC pricing is where the government compels the monopolist to charge $P_{MC}$ and produce $Q_{MC}$, where $P = MC$
- This is the socially optimal level of output
- But, such a pricing will cause the firm to make a loss equal to the shaded area as the price $P_{MC}$ is lower than their AC
- The government has to subsides the natural monopolist for the loss so that they at least earn normal profits and can continue production
- Alternatively, if the monopoly is able to levy a fixed initial charge for access to the service such that the charge amounts to the shaded area to offset the loss
- These are known as registration fees, connection fees, or administrative charges, and such pricing is known as a two-part tariff system
### AC pricing
- If the government is not willing or able to subsidise the monopoly, they can use AC pricing, where the firms charges price $P_{AC}$ and produces $Q_{AC}$, making normal profits
- This is not the allocative efficient outcome, but it is the closest we can get to the social optimum without having the government to grant a subsidy
- But, due to imperfect information, regulators do not know the demand and cost curves of the monopoly and would need the monopolist to provide accurate information
- In order to maximise profits, the monopolist has incentive to provide them with inaccurate information so that they can produce less and charge higher prices
## Nationalisation
- Governments can also take over the natural monopoly and produce the good to achieve allocative efficiency and a more equitable outcome
- Since the government maximises society's welfare and is not profit-motivated, it will produce the allocative efficient output and charge the price $P=MC$
- But, the government is not profit-motivated, and has little incentive to reduce costs, resulting in significant X-inefficiency
- The government can instead build and manage the network and rent the network to private profit-maximising firms to supply the good and service to consumers
- If the government covers the loss of the natural monopoly, there is an opportunity cost as the expenditure sacrificed could have been spent on more important areas
## Subsidies
- The government can provide a per unit production subsidy that lowers the monopolists marginal cost
- This will cause the monopolist to increase output to the allocative efficient level, as MC would cut MR at the output society desires
- But, this lowers the firm's AC and may lead to supernormal profits, leading to a more inequitable income distribution
## Corporate taxation
- To reduce the earning of the monopolist, the government can tax the monopolist's supernormal profits
- This improves income distribution as the supernormal profits are taxes and redistributed by the government to the poor in osciety
- But, this reduction in supernormal profits reduces the incentive for firms to invest in R&D, which could lead to technological advancement needed for technological growth
