## Market power
- Market power is a firm's ability to influence the price of the good it sells
- The bigger a firm's market share, the larger its market power $$Market\ share =\frac{Firm's\ output\ value}{Total\ output\ value\ of\ the\ industry}\times 100\%$$
- A market concentration ratio is the percentage of the total market output of the largest few firms in the industry
### Degree of product differentiation
- The higher the degree of product differentiation, the lower the substitutability of the product and the greater the firm's market power
- In perfect competition, all firms produce a homogenous product such that each firms product is a perfect substitute of another, and each firm has no market power
- In reality, there will be some degree of product differentiation
- Consumers will perceive competitor's products to be imperfect substitutes
- Hence, when a firm raises the price, it will be able to retain some customers, and has some degree of market power
- Real differences are created through the quality of customer service, location, attributes, packaging, etc
- Imaginary differences are created through advertising
### Level of barriers to entry
- The higher the barriers to entry, the lower the degree of competition, and the greater the market power
- Barriers to entry are any obstacle or restriction faced by potential competitors which deters or restricts them from entering a market to compete with incumbent firms
- They determine the degree of competition and hence the number substitutes available, and thus determines the extent to which quantity demanded falls if a firm raises prices
- The fewer the number for firms, the fewer substitutes consumers can turn to when a firm raises price (demand is more price inelastic), thus the higher the market power
### Natural barriers
**Financial**
- Some businesses require huge initial capital expenditure and returns are uncertain
- This deters new firms from entering who are unable (due to high capital expenditure) or unwilling (due to high risk) to finance
- The government may first undertake to finance them and then privatise them at a later stage
**EOS**
- When the production of a product allows substantial internal EOS to be reaped, incumbent firms grow to a large size
- The low unit cost will pose as an entry barrier as new firms with a small market share will not have a scale of production large enough for their new costs to be low enough
- They cannot compete and survive against the larger firms
- The financial resources needed to penetrate such markets are enormous, and new firms are deterred from entering
**Natural monopoly**
- In some cases, the EOS is so substantial relative to the level of market demand that the industry cannot support more than 1 producer (e.g. network)
- The huge-set up costs allow for substantial EOS to be reaped, resulting in a very large minimum efficient scale
- The variable costs of distributing the goods are minimal
- This is known as a natural monopoly
![[natural monopoly.png]]
- The AC and MC curves are falling throughout the range of the market demand curve because it can continue to lower costs as output increases due to its substantial EOS
- A single firm can supply the market demand at a lower unit cost than two or more firms operating at lower output levels
- The EOS for producing the product are so large that only one firm can survive
- If there were two firms and each firm's market share was halved, the demand curve for each firm would be given by $D_{1/2}$
- But, there will be no output that each firm can produce profitably since AC is higher than the highest price that can be charged
- If there was 1 firm, there is a range of output the monopolist can produce profitably
**Transportation costs**
- Vast geographical distance keep markets in different locations separated from each other, limiting the extent of competition in each market
- Remote villages have high transportation costs, eliminating the potential for outside suppliers to be profitable, preventing them from entering the market
- The local grocery shop can enjoy monopoly power, and is known as a local monopoly
**Control or ownership of raw materials**
- A firm may have market power though the control of key resources, and there is little to no competition as a result
### Artificial barriers
**Patents**
- To promote inventions, governments issue patents, granting the inventor the exclusive right to produce/ sell the product or use the perdition process for a limited period
- This promotes original research and development new ideas, and technological advancement, and help the inventor recoup the costs of R&D
- But, this will limit competition as firms who do not have the right to use the knowledge needed for producing the good cannot enter the market
**Copyright**
- Copyright is property rights granted on plays, books, novels, songs, software for a period
- It gives the copyright owner the right to determine who may adapt the work to other forms, perform it, or financially benefit from the work
**Licences**
- The government awards a single firm the right to supply a good or services
- This is to control the congestion of infrastructure, synchronise output to create better service, avoid duplication, and limit consumption of certain goods
**Trade barriers**
- Trade barriers are attempts by the government through protectionist measures to prevent foreign competitors from competing in the domestic market
- These protect local firms for foreign competition, but also local workers from unemployment
- But, this increase the domestic firm's market power in the home market since foreign competition is reduced
**Strategic entry deterrence**
- When natural barriers are low, incumbent firms might design strategic barriers of their own to discourage potential entrants from entering and competing in the market
- They may do so even if it is not profit maximising currently
## Types of market structures
### Perfect competition
- There are no obstacles to prevent new firms from entering the industry or to prevent existing firms from leaving the industry
- There are many sellers, and each seller's output is insignificant (firms have small market share) relative to the total or market supply
- There is no dominant firm whose output is large enough to influence the market price (all firms are price takers)
- Each firm sells a homogenous product, and there are no differences, real or imaginary, between the product of one firm and that of another
- The product sold by one firms is identical to that of another firm, making a perfect substitute
- Consumers have perfect information on prices in every part of the market, and will not buy at a higher price when lower ones are available
- Consumers have perfect knowledge on the types and quality of product available in the market, and advertising will not work
- Producers have perfect knowledge of factor/ input prices and the latest technology, and are able to choose the productively efficient method of production and minimise cost
- Producers are aware of the types of profits made by every other producer in the industry, and new firms will enter when existing firms are making supernormal profits
### Monopolistic competition
- There are limited obstacles or barriers to prevent new firms from entering the industry or prevent existing firms from closing down and leaving the industry
- The number of firms are so large that each firm produces a small proportion of the total market output, and cannot influence price
- There is no mutual independence between firms, and firms determine its price-output policy without considering the reaction of others
- This is because each firm's actions will not have significant impact on the market to cause other firms to respond to its actions
- Firms are competitors, not rivals
- Firms sells a product that is similar but not identical, and it is slightly different from others, but not so different that consumers will see them as separate products
### Oligopoly
- Barriers to entry are lower than a monopoly, but high enough such that entry is restricted or limited to a few sellers
- There are thousands of firms, but a few firms dominating or leading the industry, and they have a higher market share
- They are price setters as they have a high degree of market power due to their market domination
- Each firm takes the actions and reactions of rivals into account when making their on production and marketing decisions, which is known as mutual interdependence
- An oligopoly that produces a homogenous product is known as a perfect oligopoly
- An oligopoly that producers a differentiated product is known as an imperfect oligopoly
### Monopoly
- High barriers to entry and exist, that is its impossible for a new firm to enter
- There is one seller that dominates the market
- The product does not have any close substitutes, and a low cross price elasticity
## Relationship between market structure and market power
- The higher then barriers to entry, the lower the level of competition and the greater the market power of firms
### Perfect competition
- In a perfect competition, no firms will be able to affect the market price by changing its output
- Each firms is a price taker by charging the market equilibrium price, where demand and supply intersect
- Each firm will not charge a price lower than the market price because it is not profit-maximising, as they can sell as many units they want at the prevailing market price
- Each firm will not charge a price higher than the market price because it will lose all its customers to other firms selling at the market price that are selling an identical product
- Demand for each firm's product is perfectly price elastic
### Imperfect competition
- Firms have market power, and are price setters
- In monopolistic competition, each firm is selling a differentiated produced, enabling it to raise prices without losing all its sales
- Some customers are willing to pay higher prices for the differentiated product
- In an oligopoly, the diffrentiated product and high barriers to entry allow them to be price setters
- Each firm has limited competition, allowing it to rise prices without facing significant losses due to limited availability of substitutes
- In a monopoly, the high barriers to entry lead to the absence of competition, and a rise in prices would not lead to significant losses due to a lack of/ no substitutes
- Thus, an imperfectly competitive market faces a downward sloping demand curve
- A firm with greater market power will have a more price inelastic demand curve due to a lack of substitutes
## Output decision
- To maximise total profits, firms will produce at the profit-maximising level of output where marginal revenue = marginal cost
- When MR > MC, an additional unit of output adds more to total revenue than total cost, causing total profits to rise, and firm is not yielding the highest level of total profit yet
- It will increase production
- When MR < MC, an additional unit out output adds more to total cost than total revenue, causing total profits to fall, and the firms is not yielding the highest level of profit
- It will decrease production
- At MR = MC, the firm cannot increase or decrease its profit by increasing or decreasing production
- It is in equilibrium as there is no tendency for the firm to change its output level since total profits are maximised
## Pricing decision
- Imperfectly competitive firms can affect the price of the product it sells
- Firms will fully exploit its market power by charging the highest price that consumers are willing and able to pay
- This is assuming there is no rival consciousness, there is no regulation by the government, and firms have knowledge on their revenue and costs
- As an imperfectly competitive firm has market power, its demand curve is downward sloping, causing marginal revenue to be lower than price or average revenue
- Firms will produce up to MR = MC to maximise total profit
- It will then fully exploit its market power and change the highest price given by the demand curve for the output
- This is the highest price that consumers are willing and able to pay
### Types of profits
- When P > ATC or TR > TC, the firms is earning supernormal profits
![[supernormal profits.png]]
- When P = ATC or TR = TC, the firm is earning normal profits
![[normal profits.png]]
- When P < ATC or TR < TC, the firm is earning subnormal profits
![[subnormal profits.png]]
## Shut-down decision
- A shut down refers to a short run decision not to produce anything during a specific period because of market conditions
- ==A firms should shut down if TR is not able to cover all variable costs== ($TR < TVC$ or $P < AVC$)
- If a firms total revenue cannot cover all its variable costs of production, by shutting down, it only incurs fixed costs
- But, by continuing, it incurs both fixed and variable costs
- Shutting down helps it to minimise losses
## Long-run exit decision
- Exit refers to a long run decision to leave the market
- In the long-run, all costs are variable, as firms can choose the industry it operates in, or adjust the size of their plants
- Firms should only stay in operation if they can cover all costs
- If firms are making subnormal profits (losses), where $P<AC$, they should leave the industry
- They must earn at least normal profits 
## Profits in the long run
**Perfect competition**
- Under perfect competition, firms will be making only normal profits in the long run due to the low barriers of entry and exit
- If it is making supernormal profits, new firms will enter and cause supply to rise, putting downward pressure on price, eroding the supernormal profits
- Long run equilibrium is reached when the supernormal profits are completely eroded and firms are only earning normal profits
- If it is making subnormal profits, firms will exit and will cause supply to fall, putting upward pressure on prices, eroding the subnormal profits
- Long run equilibrium is reached when subnormal profits are completely eroded, and firms are earning normal profit
**Monopolistic competition**
- A monopolistically competitive firm can only make normal profits in the long run due to the low barriers of entry and exit
- If it is earning supernormal profits, new firms will enter the industry, causing demand to fall and become more price elastic, eroding the supernormal profits
- Long-run equilibrium is reached when all supernormal profits are completely eroded, and the firm is earning normal profits
- If it is earning subnormal profits, firms will exit the industry, causing demand to rise and become less price elastic, eroding the subnormal profits
- Long-run equilibrium is reached when all subnormal profits are completely eroded, and the firm is earning normal profits
**Oligopoly/ monopoly**
- Oligopolies/ monopolies can continue to enjoy making supernormal profits in the long run as new firms cannot enter the industry due to the high barriers of entry and exit

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Changes in demand affecting profits of an MC firm
>![[changes in demand affecting profits of an MC firm.png]]
>- Initial position
>	- The restaurant that serves Korean meals using using a plant (restaurant) whose cost curves are represented by $MC$ and $ATC$
>	- The demand curve is $D$ and the marginal revenue curve is $MR$
>	- Profit maximizing level of output is $Q$, where MR = MC
>	- The firms charges the price $P$ based on the level of demand
>	- The price = ATC and the firm only earns normal profits
>- Introduce the change
>	- A growing interest in Korean culture has led to the rise in demand for Korean meals, causing demand to rise to $D'$ and MR rise to $MR'$
>- Response in the short run
>	- This firm will increase output to $Q'$ as for each unit in $Q' - Q$, MR > MC and total profits could be increased by increasing output
>	- The firm raises its price to $P'$ as this is the highest price that consumers are now willing to able to pay at $Q'$ units
>	- At the new output level, supernormal profits of area $P'BCX$ are made
>- Response in the long run
>	- The new supernormal profits attract new firms into the industry in the long run
>	- New firms are able to enter due to the very low entry barriers into the industry
>	- As new firms enter, the existing firm will have more competitors and hence its market share decreases
>	- The fall in demand is represented by a leftward shift of the demand curve for its product
>	- There are more substitutes available, and demand becomes more price elastic
>	- This process continues until demand curve $D$ is tangent to the ATC curve at point $A$
>	- At this point, the firm maximizes profit by producing at $Q$ where MR = MC and the price $P$ is enough to cover average costs
>	- It is back to earning normal profits

## Allocative efficiency
**Perfect competition**
- Assuming no externalities, and the good is a private good, perfect competition would lead to allocative efficiency
- When firms have no market power, the pursuit of profit maximisation would lead to allocative efficient
- Firms are price takers, and will take market price, which is the $MR$ of selling an additional unit
- Firms will maximise profits and produce until $MR=MC=P$
- The market equilibrium quantity will be allocative efficient, as the demand and supply curve intersect where $P=MC$ 
- The price/ marginal benefit of the last good purchased is equal to the marginal cost (opportunity) cost of producing the unit
- The last unit produced is valued as much as any other good that could have been produced using the same resources
- There is no way to reallocate resources to increase the net total benefit for society, and there is neither over nor under production 
**Imperfectly competitive**
- When a firm has market power, its demand curve is downward sloping, and marginal revenue is below the demand curve
![[allocative inefficency firms.png]]
- The firm will maximise profits and produce up to $MR=MC$
- An imperfectly competitive firm will exploit its market power and charge a price $P_M$, which is greater than $MC$
- Hence, the price charged is higher than MC of production
- For units $Q_M-Q^*$, $P>MC$ and the price consumers are willing to pay for the marginal unit exceeds the additional cost incurred by society in producing it
- There is underproduction of the good, leading to allocative inefficiency, as there is a gain to society welfare if $Q_M-Q^*$ units were produced
- Total social benefit is given by area $abQ^*Q_M$, total social cost is given by $cbQ^*Q_m$
- There is a deadweight loss of area $abc$
- The extent of allocative inefficiency is less severe in monopolistic competition
- This is because the demand for a monopolistic competitive firm is more price elastic as there are lesser firms in the industry, and it is less able to charge a higher price
## Productive efficiency
- Productive efficiency occurs when a firm is producing its output at the lowest possible unit cost
- When firms are profit maximisers, they will be cost-minimisers and thus productive efficient
- But, monopoly firms, or oligopoly firms that colluding might be complacent and become X-inefficient, and the firm does not seek to lower unit costs
- Perfectly competitive and monopolistic competitive firms have strong incentive to be productive efficient due to low entry barriers and high level of competition
## Dynamic efficiency
- Dynamic efficiency is the situation where firms are technologically progressive through investing in R&D for process and product innovation
**Perfect competition**
- With perfect information, any invention of new products or improved methods of production can be copied by other firms, thus they lack the incentive to invest in R&D
- The lack of entry barriers also erode any supernormal profits that could be made
- They also only earn normal profits, and do not have supernormal profits to fund expensive R&D
**Monopolistic competition**
- Firms do engage in some innovation to differentiate their product, raising demand and decreasing price elasticity of demand
- But, due to the low barriers of entry leading to the erosion of any supernormal profits, and the difficulty of obtaining loans, they do not have the incentive or ability to engage in revolutionary R&D
**Monopoly**
- Monopolies have the incentive and ability to engage in innovation due the possibility of earning supernormal profit in the long run
- But, they might not innovate since it is already earning supernormal profits and will be complacent unless there is the treat of entry of new firms
**Oligopoly**
- Oligopolists have the incentive and ability to innovate
- Due to rival consciousness, firms are afraid of price competition as it can lead to a price war, causing them to opt for non-price competition by improving products via innovation
- The desire to start a price war or survive one may cause them to engage in process innovation
## Are monopolies desirable
- A monopoly's profit maximising decision making and behaviour leads to allocative inefficiency 
- Besides price exceeding MC, the price charged by a monopolist will be higher than prices in a perfectly competitive market
![[argument against monopolies.png]]
- Assuming there is no difference in the economies of scale achieved by a monopoly compared to a perfectly competitive industry,
- They operate under the same conditions $$MC_{Monopoly} = \Sigma MC_{PC\ firms} = SS_{PC\ industry}$$
- Under perfect competition, market equilibrium occurs when market demand = market supply
- Equilibrium price is $P_{PC}$ and output is $Q_{PC}$, which is allocative efficient as $P_{PC} = MC$
- If the market was monopolised by one firm, the monopolist in pursuit of profit maximisation, produces $Q_M$ where $MR = MC_{Monopoly}$ and charges a price $P_M$
- Price is higher and output is lower under a monopoly than under a PC industry
- There is underproduction of the good, and there is welfare loss of area $abc$ by producing at $Q_M$
- But, the assumption that a monopoly has the same cost structure as a perfectly competitive industry may not always hold
- Monopolies may use a large plant that allows it to enjoy EOS which are not open to the smaller firms in a perfectly competitive industry
![[argument for monopolies.png]]
- Under perfect competition, $DD=SS_{PC}$ and price is at $P_{PC}$ and output is at $Q_{PC}$
- Assume that a monopoly would enjoy substantial EOS, and the monopolists MC curve would be lower than the $SS_{PC\ industry}$
- Monopolists maximises profits at price $P_M$ and output $Q_M$, where MR = MC
- Consumers benefit form the lower price and higher output, but it is still allocative inefficiency as P > MC
### Inequity
- Perfect competition and monopolistic competition firms only earn normal profits in the long run, which is just enough to retain them in the industry
- Oligopolies and monopolies earn supernormal profits in the long run, and sustained supernormal profits may come at the expense of consumers paying higher prices
- The monopoly/ oligopoly shareholders are also probably more affluent than their customers
