## Taxes
- A government can impose and indirect tax, which is a tax on on goods and services
- Producers have the legal responsibility to pay such taxes to the government, but some of the tax may be passed onto consumer by firms through a higher price
- This is done in order to discourage consumption/ production  of a particular goods, or to raise tax revenue to finance government spending
![[Production tax.jpeg]]
- To correct the problem of negative externalities, a government can levy a tax on output to reduce consumption/ production levels to the socially optimal level
- The government could impose a per unit output tax equal to the MEC at the socially optimal output $Q*$
- This forces firms to internalise the external costs when making production decisions
- This raises the firms marginal private costs of production, causing supply to fall
- The SS curve (also the MPC curve) will shift leftwards to SS' (MPC') by the amount of MEC at $Q*$
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEC accurately, the tax results in a fall in market equilibrium from $Q$ to $Q*$
- The fall in supply due to the indirect tax would lead to a shortage, which creates upwards upward pressure on price
- As price rises, quantity demanded falls until quantity demanded = quantity supplied again at a lower $Q*$ units
- The new market equilibrium output, were SS' = DD, coincides with the socially optimal output $Q*$, where MSB  = MSC, eliminating welfare loss of area D, restoring allocative efficiency
## Pollution tax
- A pollution tax is a compulsory levy imposed on producers, where firms have to pay the government a fixed fee per unit of pollution generated
- It works by creating incentives for firms to reduce pollutants/ emissions
![[Pollution tax.jpeg]]
- Rational firms will choose to lower pollution, if the marginal private benefit of lowering pollution (avoiding having to pay the pollution tax) outweighs the marginal private costs (installing equipment to reduce pollution)
- This is shown by a rise from MPC to MPC'
- With amount of pollution emitted reduced, the extent of the negative impact on third parties is reduced from MEC to MEC'
- This causes welfare loss to fall from area $D$ to area $C$, resulting in a more allocative efficient outcome
- If firms choose to pay the tax, their cost of production will rise, and as profits decrease, supply will fall
- This will also lower the levels of pollution in society and result in a more allocative efficient outcome
## Subsidies
- A production subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, but not made in exchange for any goods or services
- Done so to encourage overall consumption/ production of a particular good, or to make a good more affordable for the poor
- To correct for the problem of market failure caused by positive externalities, the government could increase consumption/ production levels by using subsidies
![[subsidy.jpeg]]
- The government could pay firms a per unit output subsidy equal to MEB at the socially optimal output $Q*$
- This would lower the producers marginal private cost of production, causing an increase in supply
- The SS curve, which is also the MPC curve, will shift rightwards to SS' (MPC') by the amount of MEB at $Q*$, leading to a fall in the price of the good/ service from $P$ to $P_1$
- This will incentivise consumers to increase their consumption towards the socially optimal level $Q*$, internalising the MEB to society
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEB accurately, the subsidy results in a rise in output from $Q$ to $Q*$
- The new market equilibrium output, where SS' = DD coincides with the socially optimal output $Q*$, where MSB = MSC
- The welfare loss of area $A$ is eliminated, and allocative efficiency is restored

- Governments can vary the per unit subsidy according to the MEB, enabling the socially optimal output level to be attained, thus they are flexible
- The government can also subsidies training by private firms to encourage existing workers whose skill sets have become redundant to continuously upgrade their skills
- With the subsidies, the price of training courses would fall, leading to an increase in quantity demanded
- As workers are now equipped with the latest skills, they can move more easily into industries that are in demand, reducing occupational immobility
## Tradable permits
- Tradable permits are permits to pollute issued to firms by a government
- The permits to pollute can be traded in a market

- The government first decided on the optimal level of pollution that is allowable
- They then auction the corresponding number of permits to pollute directly to firms or distribute the permits to firms for free
- After this initial allocation of permits, the firms are free to buy and sell the permits with each other, with the prices of permits being determined in the market by demand and supply forces
- Firms that acquire the permits acquire the right to emit the given quantity of pollution
- Firms do not all have the same costs of reducing pollution
- Firms with high clean up costs would wish to pollute above the quota for permits they were initially given, buy permits from other firms with low-clean up costs
- Firms with low clean up costs would rather pollute less than the quota assigned to them, so they can sell their permit and earn revenue from it, adding to their profits
- Firms would have to weigh the cleanup costs against the permit costs
- Some firms are incentives to find cleaner methods of production to reduce their pollution, and the overall pollution level is reduced to the total allowable pollution that the government set, achieving allocative efficiency

- Tradable permits provide incentives for firms to switch to cleaner methods of production, targeting the root cause of the problem
- They allow for certainty of outcome in terms of the overall solution level
## Grants/ vouchers
- The government can give grants (a lump sum payment for a specific purpose), or vouchers (with expiry) to consumers or producers 
- To increase the consumption/ production of goods and services
- They increase the consumers ability to spend on the goods or service, increasing their demand and therefore consumption of the goods tot the socially optimal quantity
- Thus, they achieve allocative efficiency
- They can also increase firms ability to produce more of the goods or service to improve allocative efficiency
## Direct provision
- Direct provision is when the government supplies the good directly to consumers, taking on the role of the producer
- The government can produce the goods that society wants at the socially optimal quantity, maximising society's welfare
### Free direct provision
- As the government is not profit-oriented, it does not need to earn revenue to cover the costs of production
- They can finance the production of goods and service through the taxes the government collects, and public goods can be provided for free to consumers
- Thus, this achieves allocative efficiency

- The government incurs an opportunity cost as government funds for public goods could have been spent on other areas
- The lack of perfect info may result in the government under or over producing the good
- The government is not profit motivated, and thus there is no incentive to minimise cost, leading to productive inefficiency
- One way to solve this is to outsource production to private firms
	- The government provide the funding and resources for the production and maintenance of the goods to private firms by awarding them contracts
	- Private firms are more efficient in minimising costs than the government since the cost has a direct effect on their profitability
### Direct provision (may or may not be free)
- The government may also use direct provision where there are significant positive externalities, supplying goods for free or at a very low price
![[free direct provision.jpeg]]
- The market output when the price is zero is $Q_f$, and a welfare loss of area $CDE$ is incurred
- $Q_f$ is close to the socially optimal output, $Q*$, and a smaller welfare loss is incurred, compared to the welfare loss of area ABC when $Q$ was consumed
- But, there is the possibility of creating greater welfare loss for society due to overconsumption, in cases where the MEB is not that large at the socially optimal output
- The welfare loss from over consumption, area $CDE$ is greater than the initial welfare loss of area $ABC$ from underconsumption
- In such cases, the government can instead charge a very low price for the goods

- Joint provision is when the public and private sectors can produce a particular good or service together
- The private sector create competition for the government enterprise and improves productive efficiency
## Regulations
- Regulations compel consumers/ producers to change their behaviour, or by reducing the extent of the externality to reduce the welfare loss to society
### Ban
- Bans are used when it is very difficult to sue other policies to limit the amount of the externalities generated, or when the damage cause is very severe
![[total ban.jpeg]]
- The socially optimal level of output is $Q*$, where MSB = MSC
- At $Q*$, the net total social benefit is area $A$
- Under the free market, the equilibrium output is $Q$, where DD = SS
- The negative externality causes a deadweight loss to society of area $B$
- If the government chooses the use a total ban, the ouput will drop form $Q$ to 0
- Society will no longer incur the welfare loss of area $B$, but it will also lose the net total social benefit of area $A$ from consuming/ producing $Q*$
- If the MEC was hgih such that the divergence between MPC and MSC was large resulting in area $B$ > area $A$, a total ban will improve society's welfare
- But, if the MEC is small, area $A$ > area $B$, the welfare loss from under consumption is greater than the welfare loss of under consumption
- It is better for the government to leave the market along and let it produce at $Q$
### Quota
- A quota is a measure by which the government regulates the quantity of a goods that can be offered for sale
![[quota.jpeg]]
- With the quota, the quantity of goods that can be sold is fixed to $Q_2$
- The new supply curve is represented by the bold line in diagram 2, resulting in the new equilibrium price of $P_2$, where DD = SS
### Compulsory consumption of goods and services
- E.g. Singapore children have to attend to a minimum of 6 years of education
- If the new quantity consumed rises to the socially optimal level, welfare loss will be eliminated
### Laws to address adverse selection
- To manage adverse selection, there is a need to put in place structures that allow for a free flow of information
- The government can enforce certain rules and regulations to ensure more information is provided tot he side which has lesser information, improving their access to information
### Lemon Law
- Lemon laws force sellers to replace or repair defective goods, and allow the buyers to a right to a discount/ refund if the repairs or replacements are not possible at a reasonable time
- As there is now an avenue for buyers to punish the sellers should the good be found to be defective, sellers are force to be honest about the productive quality
- Buyers would be more willing to pay higher prices for good quality products, since they have greater assurance of the product quality
- This reduces the problem of adverse selection as buyers and sellers of good quality product can engage in mutually advantageous trade based on an agreeable price
## Public education
- Public education provides information to educate consumers on the true marginal private benefits of consumption when there is imperfect information
- This reduces the extent of information failure in the market, and encourages consumers to consumer more/ less of a good
![[public education.jpeg]]
- With public education, consumers are aware of the true marginal private costs of being vaccinated, and their willingness to be vaccinated increases
- This increases demand for vaccination to increase to the true MPB curve (DD')
- The new market equilibrium quantity matches the socially optimal quantity to be consumed at $Q*$, resolving allocative inefficiency
## Evaluation
### Imperfect information
- In order for market-oriented policies like taxes and subsides to effectively achieve the socially optimal level of output, the government needs to be able to determine accurately the optimal level of the tax or subsidy
- In the case of a tax/ subsidy, the government may not have perfect information on the MEB/ MEC at the socially optimal output
- In the case of tradable permits, the government may not have perfect information on the optimal total allowable pollution level
- For command policies like the direct provision of public goods, the government may not have perfect information on what is the socially optimal quantity to be produced
- However, having some quantity of the good being produced by the government is better than having non at all under the free market
- This may not apply to counties like Singapore, where the country is small and the method of obtaining information is efficient due to technologically advanced methods of data collection
### Price elasticity of demand
- A production tax has the effect of increasing the price of a good
- But if demadn for the good is price inelastic, the rise in price will cause quantity demanded to fall less than proportionately
- A higher tax is required to lower the quantity demand by enough to reach the socially optimal level
### Responsiveness of consumers/ producers to measure
- The effectiveness of education depends on consumers' responsiveness
- It may take a long period of time as it is hard to change existing mindsets, which consumers decisions are based on
- But, it is still necessary as it is the only way to solve information failure
### Cognitive biases
- Economic agents may not always make rational decisions as decision making can be affected by cognitive biases resulting in irrational decisions
- Governments can consider the cognitive biases of people when designing policies
#### Sunk cost fallacy
- Sunk costs are costs that already have been incurred by economic agents and cannot be recovered
- They are not considered during decision-making as they are irrelevant for both present and future economic decision, only the future benefits and costs matter
- The sunk cost fallacy is the human tendency to continue a behaviour as a result of previously invested resources whether or not the MC outweighs the MB
- For example, the cost of owning a car is expensive, and once a car has been purchased, these are sunk costs, and should not impact a drivers decision whether or not to drive to a location
- However, drivers in Singapore then to use their cars more often to make the price paid 'worthwhile' due to sunk cost fallacy
- This worsens congestion and increases car usage, the opposite of the goal of raising the cost of owning a car
- Drivers are also less responsive to a rise in ERP, since they have already invested so much into buying. car, making them reluctant to cut back on driving, reducing the effectiveness of the ERP
### Loss aversion
- This refers to the tendency of people to prefer avoiding a loss over making an equivalent or equal gain
- Taxing the use of plastic bags is more effective than subsidising the use of alternatives as consumers tend to avoid losses
- The pain of losing is two times stronger than the pleasure of gaining
### Saliency bias
- Saliency bias refers tot the tendency for people to focus on information that is more prominent and ignore other less prominent but equally relevant pieces of information
- This causes economic agents to overestimate the likelihood of events that come easily to mine, skewing the weighting of benefits and costs when making decisions
- For example, when the government wants tot tackle sugar consumption, They are more likely to be successful if it were to focus on how sugar can help weight loss than how it can help prevent diabetes
- obesity is amore visible problem compared to other health issues such as diabetes
### Targeting the root cause of the problem
- Pollution tax and tradable permits are more effective than a production tax as it targets the root cause of the problem
- A production tax reduces the amount of negative externalities indirectly by reducing the quantity of goods produced/ consumed, producers do not have any incentives to develop methods to lower incentives
- Pollution tax will give firms the incentives to find cleaner production methods or engage in R&D that allows them to reduce the amount of tax it needs to pay, reducing pollution
### Unintended consequences
- Taxes on goods and services increase the MPC, thus reducing supply and leading to a rise in the price of the good
- If the good is a necessity, it may have a particularly negative impact on low income households
- This is because it is less affordable for them a, causing them to be rationed out of the energy market
- Since it is a necessity, it leads to a new problem of inequity, where there is unfair distribution of the good since only the rich who have a higher ability to pay for it will be able to afford it
- Subsidies, grants and vouchers for necessities will benefit poor households in particular as the subsidy causes the good to become cheaper, enabling more lower income households to afford the good/service
### Long-term sustainability
- Whether or not these policies are sustainable in the long run depends on the cost of of implement
- For regulations to be effective, the government must have the recourses and capability to ensure compliance by consumers and firms
- But, this may be difficult in large countries where it is difficult to monitor every area effectively and monitoring costs will be high
- Taxes on goods with price inelastic demand generates a lot of tax revenue as the tax will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, and can be sued to finance alternative measures and implementation costs
- Direct provision of goods and services, subsidies, grants and vouchers require the use of government funds to finance, and may incur opportunity cost
  The government may also run a budget deficit, which is not sustainable in the long run
### Cost efficiency
- A policy is cost efficient if it is the least cost method to solve the market failure problem
