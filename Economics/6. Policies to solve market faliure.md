## Taxes
- A tax on goods and services is called an indirect tax
- Producers are the ones with the responsibility to pay such taxes to the government, but some of the tax may be passed onto consumers by firms through higher prices
- This could be to discourage consumption/ production of a goods
- It could also be used to raise tax revenue and finance government spending
### Production tax
- Governments can impose a tax to reduce the consumption/ production levels of a particular good
- For example, to correct the problem of negative externalities due to air pollution in the production of petrochemicals, the government can levy a tax on output (production tax)
- This will help to reduce consumption/ production levels to the socially optimal level
![[Production tax.jpeg]]
- The government can impose a per unit output tax equal to the marginal external cost at the socially optimal output $Q*$
- This will force firms to internalise the external costs when making production decisions
- The output tax raises the producers marginal private costs of production (MPC), causing supply to fall
- SS curve (MPC) will shift vertically upwards to $SS' (MPC')$, by the amount of MEC at $Q*$
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEC accurately, the tax results in a fall in market equilibrium output from $Q$ to $Q*$
- This is because the fall in supply due to the indirect tax would lead to a shortage, putting upward pressure on price
- As price rises, this disincentivises consumption, and quantity demanded falls until quantity demanded equals quantity supply again at a lower $Q*$ units
- At the new market equilibrium output, where $SS' = DD$ coincides with socially optimal output $Q*$, where $MSB = MSC$
- The welfare loss of area $D$ will be eliminated, and allocative efficiency is restored
### Pollution tax
- A pollution tax is a compulsory levy improved on producers, where firms have to pay the government a fixed fee per unit of pollution
- A pollution tax works by creating incentives for firms to reduce pollutants/ emissions such as by using cleaner production methods to reduce the amount of taxes paid
![[Pollution tax.jpeg]]
- With this tax, rational firms will choose to lower pollution if the marginal private benefit of lowering pollution (avoiding having to pay the pollution tax) is greater than the marginal private cost of lowering pollution (installing equipment to reduce emissions)
- This will cause $MPC$ to rise to $MPC'$ 
- With the reduction of pollution emitted, there would be a reduction in welfare loss to society from area $D$ to area $C$, resulting in a more allocative efficient outcome
- If firms choose to pay the tax, their cost of production will rise
- As profits decrease, they will end up cutting back production, leading to a fall in supply, lowering the levels of pollution in society, resulting in a more allocative efficient outcome
## Subsidies
- A production subsidy is a payment by the government to producers to encourage production of goods or services, but not made in exchange for any goods or services
- This is to increase overall consumption/ production of a good
- It could also make a good more affordable for the poor
### To address market failure
- Subsidies correct allocative efficiency by increasing consumption/ production of the good or service
- For example, in the case of positive externalities, the government could increase consumption/ production levels by granting per unit output subsidies to firms
![[subsidy.jpeg]]
- The government could pay firms a per unit output subsidy equal to MEB at the socially optimal output $Q*$
- The per unit output will lower the producers' marginal cost of production, causing an increase in supply
- The SS curve (MPC) will shift vertically downwards $SS' (MPC')$ by the amount of MEB at $Q*$
- This will lead to a fall in price of the good/ service from $P$ to $P'$
- This lower price will incentivise consumers to increase their consumption towards the socially optimal level of output $Q'$, internalising the MEB to society
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEB accurately, the subsidy results in a rise in output from $Q$ to $Q*$
- The new market equilibrium output, where $SS' = DD$ coincides with the socially optimal output $Q*$, where $MSB = MSC$, causing the welfare loss of area $A$ to be eliminated
- The government can vary the per unit subsidy according to the MEB, enabling the social optimal output to be obtained
### To address factor immobility
- The government can also subsidise the provision of training by private firms to encourage workers whose skillsets have become redundant to upgrade their skills
- The price of training costs would fall, leading to a rise in quantity demanded
- As workers are equipped with the latest skills, they can move more easily into industries that are in demand, reducing occupational mobility
## Tradable permits
- Tradable permits are permits to pollute issued to firms by a government, which can be traded in a market
- The government first decides on the optimal level of pollution that is allowable
- The government can then auction the corresponding number of permits to pollute directly to firms or distribute them for free
- Firms are then free to buy and sell the permits with each other, with the price of permits being determined in the market by demand and supply forces
- Firms that acquire the permits acquire the right to emit the given quantity of pollution 
- Firms do not all face the same cost of reducing pollution
- Firms with high clean up costs would wish to pollute above the quota of permits they were initially allocated
- They may buy permits from other firms with low-clean up costs, who would rather pollute lesser than the quota they were assigned
- They can sell their permit and earn revenue from it, adding to their profits
- Firms would weigh cleanup costs against the cost of buying a permit
- Thus, some firms are incentivised to find cleaner methods of production to reduce their pollution, and the overall pollution level is reduced to the total allowable pollution
- Tradable permits provide incentives to producers to switch to cleaner methods of production, targeting the root cost of the problem
- They allow for certainty of outcome in terms of overall pollution level, since the government decides on the total allowable pollution and the number of permits to issue
## Grants/ vouchers
- The government can give grants (a lump sum payment for a specific purpose) or vouchers (with expiry) to consumers or producers to increase the consumption/ production of a good or service
- These increase consumer's ability to spend on goods and services, increasing demand and therefore consumption of the good to to socially optimal quantity
- Grants to producers can also increase their ability to produce more of the good or service to improve allocative efficiency
## Direct provision
- Direct provision is when the government supplies the good directly to consumers, taking on the role of producer
### For public goods
- The market fails to allocate resources to the production of public goods as private producers would not produce them due to a lack of effective demand
- This would result in a missing market and a significant welfare loss to society
- Hence, the government must step in to ensure that public goods are produced at socially desirable levels
- As the government is not profit-oriented, it does not need to earn revenue to cover the cost of production
- The direct provision of good and services can be finance through the taxes the government collects, and the public goods can be provided free of charge to consumers
- This is known as free direct provision, achieving allocative efficiency
- However, funding the provision of public goods causes the government to incur an opportunity cost
- This is because government funds used to public goods could have been spent on other areas
- The lack of perfect information may result in under or over production of the good
- There could be productive inefficiency
- Unlike profit-motivated firms that have the incentive to produce output at the east possible costs, government firms only want to meet the output level targets set
- It might thus lack the incentive to minimise cost as it is not profit motivated, leading to productive inefficiency
- The government could merely provide the funding and outsource the production and maintenance of the goods to private producing by awarding them contracts
- Private producers are more efficient in minimising costs than public sector , as cost has a direct effect on their profitability
### For positive externalities
- Government may also take over the production of good and services where there are significant positive externalities like education or healthcare
- It can supply these goods to consumers for free or at a very low price
![[free direct provision.jpeg]]
- In this case, the market output is when the price is zero at $Q_f$ and a welfare loss of area $CDE$ is incurred
- But, $Q_f$ is closer to the socially optimal level of output, $Q*$, than $Q$ and a smaller welfare loss is incurred
- But, there is also a possibility of creating greater welfare loss in cases where MEB is not that large at the socially optimal level of output
- The welfare loss of area $CDE$ from overconsumption will be larger than the initial welfare loss area $ABC$
- The government can instead directly provide the goods and charge a positive low price for it
## Rules and regulations
- Governments can influence consumer's or firms behaviour through imposing regulations, which uses the law to compel certain actions to be taken by consumers or firms
- Those who violate the law would face punishment in the form of fines or imprisonment
- E.g. standards or command the use of particular methods to limit negative externalities, limiting sale of goods at certain times/ places
### Ban
- Bans are used when it is very difficult to use other policies to limit the amount of the externalities generated, or when the damage caused is severe
- A total ban, where zero quantity of the good is allowed to be consumed/ produced may be imposed
![[total ban.jpeg]]
- The socially optimal level of output is $Q*$, where MSB = MSC
- At $Q*$, the total social benefit is equal to area $A$
- Under the free market, the equilibrium output is $Q$, where DD=SS
- The negative eternality causes a welfare loss to society of area $B$
- If the government bans production to eliminate the externality, output will fall form $Q$ to 0
- Society will no longer incur the welfare loss of area $B$, but it will also lose the net total social benefit of area $A$ from consuming/ producing $Q*$
- But, if MEC was high such that the divergence between MSC and MPC was large, resulting in area $B$ > area $A$, there is an improvement in social welfare
- But, if area $A$ > area $B$, it is better to leave the market along and let it produce at $Q$
- Thus, whether a ban is desirable or not depends on the extent of negative externality
- If MEC is high, bans lead to an improvement in society's welfare
### Quota
- A quota is a measure where the government regulates the quantity of a good that can be offered for sale
![[quota.jpeg]]
- Initially, at market equilibrium, equilibrium price is at $P_1$ and equilibrium quantity is at $Q_1$
- If the government imposes a quota, fixing the new quantity of goods to be $Q_2$, the new supply curve is given by the bold line
- This results in the new equilibrium price of $P_2$
### Lemon law
- In the case of adverse selection, the cause of the problem is the lack of information
- To manage adverse selection, there is a need to put in place structures to allow for a free flow of information
- The government can enforce certain rules and regulations to ensure more information is provided to the side that has lesser information
- A Lemon Law forces sellers to replace or repair defective goods and allows buyers the right to a discount or refund if the repairs or replacements are not possible or within a reasonable time
- There is now a avenue for buyers to 'punish' the seller should the good be defective, and sellers are forced to be honest about the product quality
- Buyers would be more willing to pay for higher quality produts since they have an assurance of product quality
- This reduces adverse selection as buyers and sellers of good quality products can engage in mutually advantageous trade base on a agreeable price
## Education
- This addresses the problem of imperfect information, by providing information to educate consumers on the true marginal private benefits of consuming these goods
- This reduces the extent of information failure in the market and encourages consumers to consume more/ less of a good
![[public education.jpeg]]
- With education, consumers are aware of the true marginal private benefits of being vaccinated
- Consumers' willingness to get vaccinated increases, causing demand for vaccination to increase to the true MPB curve ($DD'$)
- The new market equilibrium quantity matches the socially optimal quantity to be consumed at $Q*$, resolving the allocative efficiency problem
## Evaluation
### Imperfect information
- In order for market-oriented policies like taxes and subsides to effectively achieve the socially optimal level of output, the government needs to be able to determine accurately the optimal level of the tax or subsidy
- In the case of a tax/ subsidy, the government may not have perfect information on the MEB/ MEC at the socially optimal output
- In the case of tradable permits, the government may not have perfect information on the optimal total allowable pollution level
- For command policies like the direct provision of public goods, the government may not have perfect information on what is the socially optimal quantity to be produced
- However, having some quantity of the good being produced by the government is better than having non at all under the free market
- This may not apply to counties like Singapore, where the country is small and the method of obtaining information is efficient due to technologically advanced methods of data collection
### Price elasticity of demand
- A production tax has the effect of increasing the price of a good
- But if demand for the good is price inelastic, the rise in price will cause quantity demanded to fall less than proportionately
- A higher tax is required to lower the quantity demand by enough to reach the socially optimal level
### Responsiveness of consumers/ producers to measure
- The effectiveness of education depends on consumers' responsiveness
- It may take a long period of time as it is hard to change existing mindsets, which consumers decisions are based on
- But, it is still necessary as it is the only way to solve information failure
### Cognitive biases
- Economic agents may not always make rational decisions as decision making can be affected by cognitive biases resulting in irrational decisions
- Governments can consider the cognitive biases of people when designing policies
#### Sunk cost fallacy
- Sunk costs are costs that already have been incurred by economic agents and cannot be recovered
- They are not considered during decision-making as they are irrelevant for both present and future economic decision, only the future benefits and costs matter
- The sunk cost fallacy is the human tendency to continue a behaviour as a result of previously invested resources whether or not the MC outweighs the MB
- For example, the cost of owning a car is expensive, and once a car has been purchased, these are sunk costs, and should not impact a drivers decision whether or not to drive to a location
- However, drivers in Singapore then to use their cars more often to make the price paid 'worthwhile' due to sunk cost fallacy
- This worsens congestion and increases car usage, the opposite of the goal of raising the cost of owning a car
- Drivers are also less responsive to a rise in ERP, since they have already invested so much into buying. car, making them reluctant to cut back on driving, reducing the effectiveness of the ERP
#### Loss aversion
- This refers to the tendency of people to prefer avoiding a loss over making an equivalent or equal gain
- Taxing the use of plastic bags is more effective than subsidising the use of alternatives as consumers tend to avoid losses
- The pain of losing is two times stronger than the pleasure of gaining
#### Saliency bias
- Saliency bias refers tot the tendency for people to focus on information that is more prominent and ignore other less prominent but equally relevant pieces of information
- This causes economic agents to overestimate the likelihood of events that come easily to mine, skewing the weighting of benefits and costs when making decisions
- For example, when the government wants tot tackle sugar consumption, They are more likely to be successful if it were to focus on how sugar can help weight loss than how it can help prevent diabetes
- Obesity is amore visible problem compared to other health issues such as diabetes
### Targeting the root cause of the problem
- Pollution tax and tradable permits are more effective than a production tax as it targets the root cause of the problem
- A production tax reduces the amount of negative externalities indirectly by reducing the quantity of goods produced/ consumed, producers do not have any incentives to develop methods to lower incentives
- Pollution tax will give firms the incentives to find cleaner production methods or engage in R&D that allows them to reduce the amount of tax it needs to pay, reducing pollution
### Unintended consequences
- Taxes on goods and services increase the MPC, thus reducing supply and leading to a rise in the price of the good
- If the good is a necessity, it may have a particularly negative impact on low income households
- This is because it is less affordable for them a, causing them to be rationed out of the energy market
- Since it is a necessity, it leads to a new problem of inequity, where there is unfair distribution of the good since only the rich who have a higher ability to pay for it will be able to afford it
- Subsidies, grants and vouchers for necessities will benefit poor households in particular as the subsidy causes the good to become cheaper, enabling more lower income households to afford the good/service
### Long-term sustainability
- Whether or not these policies are sustainable in the long run depends on the cost of of implement
- For regulations to be effective, the government must have the recourses and capability to ensure compliance by consumers and firms
- But, this may be difficult in large countries where it is difficult to monitor every area effectively and monitoring costs will be high
- Taxes on goods with price inelastic demand generates a lot of tax revenue as the tax will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, and can be sued to finance alternative measures and implementation costs
- Direct provision of goods and services, subsidies, grants and vouchers require the use of government funds to finance, and may incur opportunity cost
  The government may also run a budget deficit, which is not sustainable in the long run
### Cost efficiency
- A policy is cost efficient if it is the least cost method to solve the market failure problem
