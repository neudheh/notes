## Globalisation
- ==Globalisation is increased integration of economies around the work, through the movement of goods, services, capital, labour and knowledge across international borders==
### Trade integration
- Good and services markets become integrated when trade barriers are reduced, enabling countries to engages in inter-industry and intra-industry trade more freely
### Capital mobility
- Financial markets become integrated when capital controls are reduced, enabling greater international capital flows
- International capital flows are purchases or sales of financial and real assets across international boundaries
- When foreigners buy domestic assets (e.g. shares, bonds), there is capital inflow into the country, and foreigners are lending to residents of the country
- When locals buy foreign assets, there is capital outflow from the country, and the residents are lending to foreigners
#### Short-term capital flows
- Short-term capital flows include purchases of shares/ bonds
- This allows residents of a country to diversify their wealth portfolios and spread their risks
- For firms, free capital movement enables them to raise financial capitals in international markets at a lower cost
#### Long-term capital flows
- Long term capital flows include FDI
- Firms invest overseas to tap on lower costs due to land/ labour abundance, or less restrictive regulation
- They may also do so to overcome trade barriers
### International migration
- International migration refers to the movement of labour across national borders
- Modern transportation has made it easier, cheaper and faster for people to move in search of jobs, education, opportunity and quality of life
- Migration can contribute to inclusive and sustainable growth and development in both host and home countries
- Migrants help to close labour gaps, create jobs as entrepreneurs, and pay taxes and social security contributions
- They can also contribute to the development of science and technology and enrich their host communities by providing cultural diversity
- But, migrants are fist to lose their jobs in an economic downturn
- They also receive lesser pay, work longer hours and worser conditions
## Drivers of globalisation
### Technological advancement
- Advances in telecommunications (e.g. internet) have reduced the costs of telecommunication, allowing business to reach and sell to overseas customers
- Technological advances in freight transport (shipping) have reduced to cost of transporting goods around the globe
- This encourages trade in finished products, and product fragmentation in manufacturing, where a firm locates different phases of production in different and far away countries
- Thus, there is also an increase in trade of semi-finished products
### Reduction in trade barriers
- The World Trade Organisation (WTO) promotes multilateral trade liberalisation, and has reduced trade barriers (e.g. tariffs, quotas)
- Countries can form preferential trade agreements (e.g. EU), which has led to further reduction of tariffs and other trade barriers, increasing the volume of international trade
- Free trade between countries is mutually beneficial and trade presents opportunities for economic growth
- Thus, more governments are reducing protection from foreign competition and influence, allowing trade and FDI
### Reduction in capital controls
- The liberalisation of capital markets has become increasingly common
- Capital flows between countries became more significant as more countries undertook structural reform of their financial sector and opening their economy
### Reduction in legal barriers restricting movement of labour
- Fall in legal barriers to labour mobility and relaxation of immigration policies has ld to movement of labour across borders
- EU workers have the right to move and reside, the right to entry and residence for family members, and the right to work in another member state and have equal footing with nationals of that state
## Basis of free trade and specialisation
- International trade refers to the exchange of goods and services between countries
### Free trade 
- Free trade is the economic policy by which the government does not discriminate against import from or exports to other countries
- There is an absence of government intervention and trade takes place without any restrictions (or barriers)
### Inter-industry trade
- Inter industry trade is trade in products that belong to different industries
### Theory of comparative advantage
- The theory of comparative advantage states that mutually beneficial trade between countries is possible when one country has a comparative advantage in producing an item over another country
- This means that it can produce a good/ service at at lower opportunity cost in terms of other goods sacrificed
- It makes the following assumptions
1. Perfect competition - homogenous goods, prices set by market forces
2. Perfect mobility of resources within the country
3. Imperfect mobility of resources between countries
4. Constant opportunity cost of production
5. No transport costs
6. No trade restrictions
- The theory of comparative advantage explains how trade can be mutually beneficial to countries in the form of more output and consumption levels
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- 1 unit of labour in country A and B
>
>||Country A|Country B|
>|-|-|-|
>|Cloth|2 units|4 units|
>|Hard disks|1 units|8 units|
- Countries should specialise in the production of the goods in which it has comparative advantage in and export it
- They can then import other goods in which it does not have comparative advantage in
- Absolute advantage is the ability to produce a good at a lower absolute cost (i.e. it uses lesser resources in production/ can produce more with the same amount of resources)
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Country B has an absolute advantage of country A in producing cloth and hard disks as it is able to produce more of both cloth and hard disks using one unit of labour

- But, when it comes to comparative advantage, we look at opportunity cost and the difference in opportunity cost in comparative advantage
- The terms of trade measures the exchange rate of one good/ service for another when two countries trade with each other
- For mutually beneficial trade, the required range of the terms trade must be between the two countries opportunity cost
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Country B incurs an opportunity cost of 2 hard disks when producing 1 unit of cloth, while country A incurs an opportunity cost of 0.5 hard disks
>- Country A incurs an opportunity cost of 2 unit of cloth when producing 1 hard disk, while country B incurs an opportunity cost of 0.5 cloth
>- Country A has a comparative advantage in producing cloth, while country B has a comparative advantage in producing hard disks
>- To benefit from trade, for each unit of cloth exported, country A must obtain more than 0.5 hard disks from country B
>- Country B must give up less than 2 hard disks to import a unit of cloth
>- Thus, for mutually beneficial trade, the required terms of trade 0.5 hard disks < 1 cloth < 2 hard disks

- Thus both countries can enjoy higher levels of consumption as each country would get more of the other good than by domestic consumption
### Terms of trade
- Terms of trade can also be measured using export and import price indices $$Terms\ of\ trade = \frac{Export\ price\ index}{Import\ price\ index}$$
- The terms of trade would have improved if a given quantity of exports can be exchanged for a higher quantity of imports
- The terms of trade would have deteriorated if a given quantity of exports can be exchanged for a lower quantity of imports
## Factors that determine a countries comparative advantage
### Factor endowment
- The quantity and quality of factors of production are unevenly distributed over different countries resulting in differences in opportunity costs of production
- Land-abundant countries (e.g. Australia) produce land-intensive products such as agriculture at lower opportunity cot than land-scarce countries (e.g. Singapore)
- They have a comparative advantage in producing land-intensive products as the use of land for these products has a lower opportunity cost in terms of other goods forgone
- Labour-abundant countries (e.g. China) have comparative advantage in producing labour-intensive products (e.g. clothes)
- This is because they produce goods at a lower opportunity cost compared to countries where labour is less abundant
### Capital accumulation, level of technology and skills of the labour force
- Accumulation of physical capital (via domestic investment or FDI) and human capital (via education) can enable a country to have comparative advantage
- E.g. Japan has comparative advantage in producing cars due to its capital stock, skilled labour force and superior technology
- Countries with a strong technological and capital base will have an comparative advantage in the production of high tech products such as electronics
### International immobility of resources
- Factors of production are immobile between countries
- Land is not transferrable from one country to another
- Labour has large geographical immobility between countries due to immigration laws that restrict the inflow of foreign labour, and differences in culture and language
- Movement of capital between countries may be hampered by political instability or government restriction, and inadequate financial legal and physical infrastructure
- Thus, intentional immobility of resources enables differences in the relative abundance of resources between countries to persist
- This allows countries to have comparative advantage in certain products
## Dynamic comparative advantage
- Comparative advantage is a dynamic concept, as a country's comparative advantage can change over time
- There may be erosion of comparative advantage due to the depletion of factors of production due to the depletion of labour endowment such as a shrinking labour force
- Comparative advantage can be gained by investing in human capital (e.g. education)
- Comparative advantage may be lost due to more rapid technological progress by international competitors
- Increased capital mobility between countries allow countries to gain comparative advantage (e.g. allowing MNCs)
## Limitations of the theory of comparative advantage
### Factor immobility in the countries
- For a country to specialise in the good that it has comparative advantage in, resources need to be moved from declining industries to expanding ones
- But, resources are not perfectly mobile as labour may lack the skills required to join expanding industries, and there is structural unemployment
- The impact of unemployment depends on the extent to which governments have skills retraining that reduces the degree of occupational immobility
### Transport costs
- The theory of comparative advantage assumes the absence of transport cots
- While a country might have comparative advantage in a good, high transport costs between countries might offset the gains form trade and discourage international trade
- The impact of transport costs may depend on the nature of the good (e.g. transport costs are higher for perishable goods)
- But, transport costs have reduced over the years due to technological progress
### Trade barriers
- Trade barriers are still present, causing a country to not be able to export as much as it likes due to these barriers
- With the absence of trade barriers, the theory of comparative advantage is not able to fully account for real world trade patterns
- Factor immobility within countries is a major source of structural unemployment for countries that are open to trade, pressing governments to impose trade barriers
## Horizontal intra-industry trade
- Intra-industry trade is international trade in goods that belong to same/ similar industries
- Horizontal-intra industry trade is trade in different varieties of the same end-product of the same industries
### Differentiated products and differences in tastes
- There are differences in taste between people living within a single country and across countries
- Hence, consumers prefer a wide choice of the same product
- Consumers of one country are willing and able to buy a differentiated product produced by another
- Such trade is not explained by the theory of comparative advantage
### Economies of scale in intra-industry specialisation
- It is not economically feasible for each country to makes small quantities of each bran in each industry as the opportunity cost would be higher
- Each country could focus on a limited range to take advantage of economies of scale, and yet cater to differences in taste by trading with one another
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- British car manufacturers specialise in cars to suit British consumers, while German car makers produce high-end cars for German consumers
>- Each country's car manufacturers enjoy EOS from specialisation
>- But, some British consumers demand cars produced from those produced in Britain, and buy them from Germany more cheaply than if they were domestically produced
### Narrowing technological gaps
- As a country innovates, it produces new products and production processes, increasing its exports
- Other countries may narrow the technological gap in time through imitation and start exporting similar products
- Thus, comparative advantage is not static, but changing gradually
- This changes the direction of trade flows, giving rise to intra industry trade
### Seasonality
- The harvesting of fruits for consumption depends on different seasons
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Americans enjoy strawberries grown in the US during the peak season from May to October
>- But, in the winter months from December to March, the US may import strawberries form countries like Australia to satisfy consumer's demand
## Vertical intra-industry trade
- Vertical intra-industry trade refers to trade in parts/ components and finished products belonging to the same industry or sector (e.g. car parts and cars)
- The theory of comparative advantage can explain this phenomenon
- Countries with low levels of technology will specialise in low-tech production, while countries with high levels of technology will specialise in high-tech production
- When the same technology is used regardless of where a good is produced, labour-intensive component production and assembly will take place in labour-abundant countries
- They have comparative advantage in this stage of the production process
- Skill-intensive and capital-intensive activities will be performed in labour and capital abundant countries
- They have the comparative advantage in these other stages of production
## Trade patterns in the real world
- The theory of comparative advantage predicts trade to occur between countries with different factor endowments, hence different opportunity cost of production
- Developing countries export land-intensive goods and labour-intensive goods to developed countries in return of their high-tech and capital intensive goods
- Product fragmentation is where firms from developed countries forge production networks with developing countries
- Skill and capital intensive components are exported by developed countries to developing countries for the labour-intensive process of assembling
- The finished product is then exported back to developed countries
- With the fall in telecommunication and transport costs, firms in developed countries have been engaging in outsourcing of parts of production to firms in developing countries
- ==Outsourcing refers to the shifting of productions operations and jobs to an external party, by contracting with a third party==
- Firms do this to reduce costs and improve efficiency
- ==Offshoring is the practise of moving all or part of a firm's operations overseas to reduce the cost of doing business==
- This has resulted in increased trade in goods and services between developing and developed countries
