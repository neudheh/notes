## Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)
- ==Income Elasticity of Demand (YED) measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in income, ceteris paribus==
- Measured by the % change in demand for a good resulting for a % change in income
- Determines the direction and magnitude/ extent of a shift in demand for a given change in income, assuming all other factors remain unchanged 
  $$YED = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ demand}{Precentage\ change\ in\ income} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}\times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}\times 100\%}$$
### Interpreting YED values
- To interpret YED values, we need to consider sign and magnitude
- Normal goods have a positive YED; the demand for normal good increases when people's income rises and vice-versa
- Inferior goods have a negative YED; the demand for inferior goods decreases when people's income rises and vice-versa

|Value of YED|Types of goods|Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative $(YED <0)$|Inferior (cheaper alternatives, second-hand clothing)| Increase in income leads to a fall in demand, Conversely, decrease in income leads to a rise in demand|
|Positive $(0 < YED < 1)$| Normal (Necessity, rice, bread)|Increase in income leads to a less than proportionate increase in demand, meaning that demand is income inelastic. Conversely, decrease in income leads to a less than proportionate decrease in demand|
|Positive $(YED > 1)$|Normal (Luxury, sports car)|Increase in income leads to a more than proportionate increase in demand, meaning that demand is income elastic, conversely decrease in income leads to a more than proportionate decrease in demand|

### Factors affecting YED values
#### Degree of necessity of the good
- Necessities (veggies, food, etc) have a low income elasticity of demand -> as peoples income change, the demand for necessities change less than proportionately
- This is because we have a limited need to consumer more/ less quantities of a necessity as our incomes change, especially if we have been consuming sufficient quantities already 
- On the other hand, luxuries have a high income elasticity of demand, as they are items we can do without  during periods of falling income
- A continuous rise in income give consumer the confidence to go ahead with big-ticket items such as cars and holidays, and the demand for luxury goods will increase more than proportionately
- Conversely, when income falls, households will cut back on these non-essential items and demand will fall more than proportionately
#### Changing perception of the good due to income level of consumers
- A good can be considered a normal good at low income levels, but the same goods may be regarded as an inferior good at higher income levels
- When income rises from an initial low level, the demand for public transport rises and the good is considered a normal good
- People still buy them as they cannot afford better substitutes such as cars
- At higher income levels, these substiutues might become affordable, and demand for public transport will fall as people switch to more desrieable substitutes
- Public transport, which was initially viewed as a normal good, is now considered a inferior goods
## Cross-price elasticity of demadn
- ==Cross price elasticity of demand (XED) measures the responsiveness of demand for one good to a change in price of another good==
- % change in the demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of another good
$$XED_{AB} = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ demand\ for \ good\ A}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ for\ good\ B} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_A}{Q_A} \times 100 \%}{\frac{\Delta P_B}{P_B} \times 100\%}$$
### Interpreting XED values
- To interpret XED values, we need to consider sign and magnitude
- The negative/ positive sign shows the type of relationship between the two goods

|Sign| Relationship between goods A and B| Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative $(XED_{AB} < 0)$|Complementary goods (Bread and butter)| If the price of good B (Bread) rise, the quantity demanded of good B falls, and lesser of good A (butter) will be demanded. If the change in demand of good A and the change in price of good B are in opposite directions, XED will be negative|
|Positive $(XED_{AB} > 0)$|Substitute goods (Butter and margarine)| If the price of good B (Margarine) rises, the quantity demanded of good B falls, and more of good A (butter) will be demanded. If the change in demand for good A and the change in price of good B are in the same direction, XED will be positive|
|$XED_{AB} = 0$| Independent goods| If the price of good B rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, but demand for good A will be unchanged|
### Factors affecting XED
#### Closeness of substitutes or complements
- The main determinant of the magnitude of XED is the closeness of the substitute or complement of the two goods
- The closer the relationship between the two goods, the larger the effect on the demand given a change in price of the related goods
- Large positive XED values -> Close Substitutes; Large negative XED values -> Close complements, and vice versa
- Close substitutes must also be in the same price range
>[!NOTE]
>- The cross price elasticity of demand for good A with respect to the price of good B can be different from the cross price elasticity of demand for good B with respect to the price of good A (i.e. $XED_{AB} â‰  XED_{BA}$ )
>- This is because of the different price ranges of the two goods (e.g. taxis and MRT)
## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
- ==Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded for the good to a change in its price, ceteris paribus==
- % change in quantity demanded for a good resulting in a % change in price of the good, ceteris paribus
- When price changes, with all other non-price factors remaining constant, PED will measure how much quantity demanded will change
$$PED = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ a\ good}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ a\ good} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta P}{P} \times 100\%}$$
- Mathematically, PED has a negative sign due to the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, but this is usually ignored
- Varies from zero to infinity

|Value of PED| Explanation|
|-|-|
|Perfectly price inelastic demand $(\lvert PED\rvert = 0)$|For a given percentage fall/ rise in price, the quantity demanded for the good remains the same, and demand for the good is perfectly price inelastic|
|Price inelastic demand $(0 < \lvert PED \rvert < 1)$|When a give percentage rise/ fall in price brings about a less then proportionate fall/ rise in quantity demanded, the demand for the good is said to be price inelastic|
|Price elastic demand $(\lvert PED \rvert > 1)$| When a given percentage rise/ fall in price brings about a more than proportionate fall/ rise in quantity demanded, the demand for the good is said to be price elastic|
|Perfectly price elastic demand $(\lvert PED \rvert = \infty)$ | At the given price, quantity demanded is infinitely large. Any increase in price will cause quantity demanded to drop to zero. The demand for the good is said to be perfectly price inelastic|

- Mathematically, every point along any straight line demand curve has varying price elasticity of demand
- It is not the gradient
![[PED on a graph.jpeg]]

>[!NOTE] Drawing demand curves
>- We only change the gradient of a demand curve to show PED because we are lazy
>- For price inelastic demand $(0 < |PED| < 1)$, draw a graph with a steep gradient
>- For price elastic demand, $(|PED| > 1)$, draw a graph with a gentle gradient
### Factors affecting PED
#### Number and closeness of substitutes
- The more numerous and the closer the substitutes, the more price elastic is the demand for the goods

**Number of substitutes**
- An increase in price of a good, causes its substitutes to become relatively cheaper
- If there are numerous, an increase in price tends to leads to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded because consumers can easily switch away

**Closeness of substitutes**
- There are a few factors affecting the closeness of the substitutes
- **Definition of the good**
	- The demand for narrowly defined goods/ services (e.g. Starbucks Caramel Frappuccino) will be price elastic as there are many close substitutes available (e.g. McCafe Caramel Frappe)
	- Goods that are widely defined (e.g. Meat) is price inelastic as there are very few close substitutes available
- **Price range**
	- Close substitutes must be in the same price range
	- The smaller the price difference, the closer the substitutes
- **Advertising**
	- Advertising raises demand by bringing the product to more people's attention and increases their desire for it
	- It also reduces PED for the good as it creates greater brand loyalty, and consumer view competitor brands as poor substitutes
	- This allows the firm to raise prices above that of its rivals with no significant fall in sales as a rise in price would lead to a less then proportionate fall in demand
#### Proportion of income spend on the goods
- The larger the proportion of income spent on the goods, the greater the PED
- This is because when the price of such goods rises, consumers ability to afford them is lowered more significantly, and so quantity demanded will fall more than proportionately
#### Degree of necessity
- A necessity is a good or service that consumers will buy regardless of their change in their income
- The more necessary a good or service is, the lower its PED
#### Habit-forming nature of the good
- When a product is habit-forming, such as addictive goods like alcohol, other goods become poor substitutes
- An alcoholic, who is addicted to alcohol will view other substitutes such as juices will see them as poor substitutes
- This lowers its PED
#### Time period
- Demand will be more price elastic in the long run than in the short run
- Time is needed for consumers to find suitable substitutes after a price change and tot taler their expenditure patterns
- Imperfect knowledge about price changes in the short run, as consumers do not have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices at all times
- This causes quantity demanded to not initially rise if price falls as consumers may not be aware of such price changes
- But, as time passes, they will be able to respond to the fall in price of the goods by reallocating their expenditure from other goods to the relatively cheaper good
## Total revenue/ expenditure
- The total expenditure paid by consumers/ households for the purchase of goods and services is equal to the total revenue received by firms/ producers for the sale of goods and services
$Household's\ expenditure\ (TE)$
$= Price\ (P) \times Quantity\ bought/sold\ (Q)$
$= Total\ revenue\ (TR)\ received\ by\ firms$
- Note that price does not change on its own, it is only through a shift in supply which leads to a change in price
### Price elastic demand
- A change in price brings about a change in total revenue in the opposite direction to the price change
![[TRTE for price elastic demand.jpeg]]
- A decrease in price leads to an increase in TR
- If prices falls from $a$ to $c$, TR increases
- Increases because the loss in revenue from the fall in price (area $abdc$) is lesser than the gain in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded (area $degf$)
### Price inelastic demand
- A change in price brings about a change in total revenue in the same direction as the price change
![[TRTE for price inelastic demand.jpeg]]
- A decrease in price leads to a decrease in TR
- If price falls from $t$ to $v$, TR decreases
- Decreases because the gain in revenue from the from the less that proportionate rise in quantity demanded (area $tuwv$) is lesser than the loss in revenue fall in price (area $wxzy$)
## Price elasticity of supply (PES)
- ==Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price, ceteris paribus==
- % change in quantity supplied of a goods resulting from a % change in price, ceteris paribus
- Positive sign, as there is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied
$$PES = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ supplied\ of\ a\ good}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ a\ good} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_s}{Q_s}\times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta P}{P} \times 100\%}$$
### Interpreting PES values

|Value of PES|Explanation|Diagram|
|-|-|-|
|Price elastic supply $(PES\ more\ than\ 1)$| A given percentage change in price brings about a more than proportionate change in quantity supplied|![[PES more than 1.jpeg]]|
|Price inelastic supply $(0 < PES < 1)$|A given percentage change in price brings about a less than proportionate change in quantity supplied|![[PES more than 0 but lesser than1.jpeg]]|
|Perfectly price elastic supply $(PES = \infty)$|Producers are able to sell at whatever quantity they want at the given price|![[PES = INF.jpeg]]|
|Perfectly price inelastic supply $(PES = 0)$|A fixed quantity that the producer can sell regardless of the price|![[PES = 0.jpeg]]|
### Factors affecting PES
#### Time period
- PES depends on how easy it is to expand or reduce output in response to a change in price, which depends on the time period that firms have to adjust their production processes
- As time period increases, the PES increases, because firms have more time tot make changes to production processes
- **Very short run**
	- Period is so short that all factors of production cannot be varied, and the quantity supplied is unable to respond to a change in price
	- Supply is perfectly price inelastic
- **Short run period**
	- Short run is the period of time where there is at least one fixed factor of production
	- In the short run, firms can only adjust by using more of the variable factors to increase production
	- Supply is relatively price inelastic
- **Long run period**
	- In the long run, all factors of production are variable
	- Existing firms can increase output by increasing all factors of production
	- New firms can respond by entering the industry as it is now more profitable
	- In the long run, supply is more price elastic
	- Quantity supplied is likely to increase more than proportionately to the rise in price
#### Behaviour of marginal costs as output changes in response to price changes
- Supply is likely to be more price elastic if
- Firms have spare capacity to increase production without a huge rise in marginal costs
	- Firms can respond to a given rise in price by using their existing resources that are easily affordable and available, and produce a more than proportionate amount
- Firms cans which away from producing alternative products easily (i.e. factors of production are mobile)
	- Factors of production can be transferred from the production of one good to another without a huge raise in marginal costs
	- E.g. Magazine printing machine can be used to print greeting cards instead easily
#### How the goods is defined
- PES is greater for narrowly defined goods
- E.g. the supply of Nike shoes is more price elastic, as Nike can easily obtain factors of production from other shoe firms
- It is harder for the whole shoe industry to obtain factors of production from other industries
## Answering technique
### Extent of a change in price
- Explain the shift in demand and supply
- Explain why the goods has price elastic/ inelastic demand/ supply
- For a shift in supply, see if demand is more elastic/ inelastic
- For a shift in demand, see if supply is more elastic/ inelastic

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Primary products are goods that have not been processed and is in it natural state, such as agricultural products (e.g. wheat, grains and meat)
>- The demand for such good tends to be price inelastic, as there are few close substitutes
>- When there's a rise in price, consumers have few alternatives to switch to and quantity demanded will fall less then proportionately
>---
>- The supply for primary products is price inelastic since the factors of production to produce such products cannot be increased easily (e.g. land to grow wheat, oil reserves) cannot be increase easily in the short run
>- Supply will increase less then proportionately in the short run

- Draw diagram and explain the new price change

>[!EXAMPLE]
>Hence, when demand and supply are both price inelastic, a shift in supply will result in price changing by a large extent

### Change in price and quantity for simultaneous shifts in demand and supply
- The change in equilibrium price and quantity depend not only on the direction of the change, but also the relative magnitude/ extent of the change in terms of demand or supply

- Explain the shift in demand and supply
- Evaluate why supply/ demand would have fallen more

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The fall in supply is likely to be more significant than the fall in demand as prolonged floods would have reduced supply significantly
>- The demand for agricultural produce likely only fell marginally when income fall since demand for such produce is income inelastic ($0 < YED < 1$)
>- Prolonged floods have caused production shocks, reducing firms ability to supply, causing supply to fall from $S_1$ to $S_2$
>- The prolonged flood would have caused a severe fall in production and supply of agricultural produce may have decreased significantly
>- The larger fall in supply relative to demand will cause a shortage at the existing price, causing price to rise in order to eliminate the shortage

- Explain why the goods has price elastic/ inelastic demand/ supply

>[!EXAMPLE]
> - The demand for agricultural products tends to be price inelastic nature as there are a few close substitutes for wheat or grains. When there is a rise in price, consumers have few alternative to switch to
> - Supply for agricultural produce is price inelastic too since the factors of production to enhance agricultural produced cannot be increased easily (e..g land to grow wheat)

- Show the rise in price

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Since demand and supply are both price inelastic, a large rise in price is required to eliminate the shortage, since the rise in price will result in a less than proportionate fall in quantity supplied and a less than proportionate increase in quantity supplied
>- Price will have increased sharply($P_1$ to $P_2$) relative to the fall in quantity ($Q_1$ to $Q_2$) at the new equilibrium $E_2$
>

### Prediction of change in total revenue/ total expenditure for simultaneous shifts in demand/ supply
- To analyse the impact on total revenue of agricultural producers, we will need to analyse the changes in supply and demand step by step

- Analyse the change while holding demand constant

>[!EXAMPLE]
> - Holding demand constant, the fall in supply from $S_1$ to $S_2$ will cause a rise in price from $P_1$ to $P'$
> - Since demand is price inelastic, the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded from $Q_1$ to $Q'$ 
> - Total revenue thus increases from $0P_1E_1Q_1$ to $0P'E'Q'$ as the equilibrium point moves from $E_1$ to $E'$

- Analyse the change while holding supply constant, continue from the total area previously calculated

>[!EXAMPLE]
> - Holding supply constant at $S_2$, the decrease in demand form $D_1$ to $D_2$ would result in a fall in total revenue from $0P'eE'Q'$ to $0_2E_2Q_2$ since both price and quantity decreases as demand falls
> - Demand is likely to fall by a smaller extent than the fall in supply due to the prolonged flood, coupled with a very price inelastic demand, and  demand for an agricultural good is income inelastic
> - the increase in total revenue from the fall in supply will outweigh the fall in total revenue from the fall in demand, causing an overall rise in total revenue
## Elasticity in decision making for firms 
### Price inelastic/ elastic demand (PED)
- For goods with price inelastic demand, firms could consider raising the prices of such goods since this will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- As a result, total revenue of the firms will rise
- To reduce the price elasticity of demand for a good, firms can adopt strategies like advertising to create brand loyalty
- On the other hand, firms selling goods with price elastic demand can consider lowering the price to raise total revenue
### Positive/ negative income elastic/ inelastic demand (YED)
- When an economy is doing well, demand for normal goods (i.e. $YED > 0$) rises and goods with $YED > 1$ will do exceptionally well
- Firms can consider allocating more of its resources to provide these higher-end products as the rise in demand will be significant and the firm's revenue is likely to rise significantly too.
- During a recession, demand for inferior goods (i.e. $YED <0$) will rise, and firms will now reallocate resources to producing lower-end products 
### Positive/ negative XED with high/ low magnitude
- If there are many rivals in the industry selling similar products (i.e. the firms is selling a good with a high cross price elasticity of demand), the firm can respond to a fall in price of its rival's good by reducing the substitutability of its own product through advertisements, improving the quality of the good, or providing better service at its outlets
- For multi-product firms that sell complementary goods, firms can reduce the price of a good to raise the demand of its complement
## Elasticity in government policy making
### Income elasticity of demand
- Knowledge of YED will enable the government to implement better policies to meet the aspirations and needs of her people
- With rising income, the government can decide to allocate more land for private housing as demand for it should rise more than proportionately as the income elasticity for demand for private housing is likely to be high
- During a recession, knowledge of YED will help a government deciding on which industries need assistance
- With a very high and positive income elasticity of demand, firms selling luxury goods will face a more than proportionate fall in demand for their goods and might need more assistance form the government
### Cross-price elasticity of demand
- A fall in price on public transport can reduce the demand for private cars usage as the XED is is positive
- If the XED for private car usage with respect to MRT travel is highly positive, meaning they are close substitutes, the positive is more likely to be effective
- But, if the XED for private car usage with respect to MRT travel is highly positive but low, not many people will switch from private car usage to taking the MRT, hence effectiveness of the policy will be low
### Price elasticity of demand
- If the government want to raise tax revenue, then it should impose indirect tax on goods with price inelastic demand (e.g. tobacco and liquor) as tax revenue will rise given a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- On the other hand, if the aim of the government is to alter consumers' behaviour by discouraging the consumption of these goods, then this is likely to be ineffective since the fall in consumption will be minimal given the addictive nature of the goods and hence its price elastic demand
### Indirect taxation
- An indirect tax is a compulsory levy imposed on the sale of goods and services, and the producer or retailer has the legal responsibility to pay the tax to the government
- There are two types:
	- A specific tax, where it is a tax that is levied as a fixed amount per unit sold, irrespective of price (e.g. $0.50 per litre of oil); 
	- An ad valorem tax, where it it a tax that is levied as a percentage of the selling price of the goods (e.g. 3% on the price of a litre of oil)
![[elasticity tax.jpeg]]
- When a indirect tax is imposed on a particular good, the marginal cost of production rises by the amount of the tax per unit
- This causes a leftwards shift of the supply curve to $S_2$
- The amount taxes is equal to the vertical distance between the two curves
- The fall in supply causes the equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and the equilibrium output to fall to $Q_2$
- Consumers pat a higher price at $P_2$ (the equilibrium price), while producers receive a lower price of $P_0$ for each unit of the good
- Initially, consumer surplus was area $abP_1$, but with the tax, price has increased to $P_2$ and quantity has fallen to $Q_2$, and the new consumer surplus is area $acP_2$, and there is a loss in consumer surplus of area $P_2cbP_1$ 
- Initially consumer surplus os area $P_1be$ but with the tax, the new consumer surplus is represented by area $P_0de$
- The total tax revenue is equal to the tax per unit X units sold = $P_2P_0 X 0Q_2$ = $P_2cdP_0$ as tax revenue
- The amount of tax revenue collected depends on the price elasticity of demand, the tax revenue is greater when demand for the good is more price inelastic
- This is because a tax (which causes price to increase) leads to a less than proportional fall in quantity demand for a good facing a price inelastic demand
- In contrast, a tax will lead to a larger fall in quantity demanded for a good facing a more price elastic demand, and the total tax revenue collected is lesser
![[tax revenue collected.jpeg]]
### Subsidy
- A subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods/ services, but not in exchange for any goods/ services
![[elasticity subsidy.jpeg]]
- When a subsidy is provided on a particular good, the marginal cost of production falls by the amount of subsidy per unit
- This cases a rightwards shift in the supply curve towards $S_2$
- Equilibrium price falls to $P_2$ and equilibrium output rises to $Q_2$ 
- Consumers pay a lower price $P_0$ for each unit of the good while producers receive a higher price of $P_2$ 
- Initially consumer surplus is represented by the area $abP_1$, but with the subsidy, price falls to $P_2$ and quantity demanded rises to $Q_2$, and the new consumer surplus is area $acP_2$, and there is a gain in consumer surplus of area $P_1bcP_2$
- Initially, producer surplus was area $P_1bd$, but with the subsidy, producer surplus is area $P_0ed$ and there is a gain of producer surplus of area $P_0ebP_1$ 
- Total expenditures by the government on the subsidy = subsidy per unit X units sold = $P_0P_2 \times 0Q_2$ = area $P_0ecP_2$
- The size of the government's expenditure depends on the price elasticity of demand; the government's expenditure on subsidy is greater when demand for the good is more price elastic
- A subsidy (which causes a fall in price) leads to a more than proportionate increase in quantity demand for a good facing a price elastic demand
- In contrast, the subsidy will lead to a smaller increase in quantity demanded for a good facing a more price inelastic demand
![[government expenditure.jpeg]]
## Limitations
- Elasticity measures are based on the assumption of ceteris paribus, which is rarely true, causing estimates to be unreliable (e.g. a firm cutting price to increase total revenue may not work as other firms may also cut price as they do not want to lose market share and total revenue)
- Elasticity values are based on past data and may not reflect in current changes in taste and preferences, etc
- Calculation of elasticities are based on small changes in price, income or prices of other goods. If there is a large percentage change, then the estimate of elasticity may be inaccurate and a false prediction will result
