## Allocative efficiency
- Allocative efficiency is a situation where the combination of goods/ services produced maximises the total economic welfare of society
- This occurs when the goods and services that are wanted by the economy are produced in the right quantities, from society's point of view
- It is achieved when Marginal Social Benefits (MSB) = Marginal Social Costs (MSC)
- I.e. the additional benefit to society of the last unit of output is equal to the additional cost to society of the last unit of output 
## Price mechanism
- A free market refers to a market free of government intervention
- The price mechanism refers to the interaction of market demand (reflecting consumer's decisions) and market supply (reflecting firms decisions)
- The price mechanism helps to answer the three basic economic questions of what and how much to produce, how to produce and for whom to produce
### Signalling and incentive role of prices
- The signalling role of prices help the economy to decide what and how much to produce of a particular good or service
- Consumer sovereignty means that consumers ultimately determine which goods and services are produced by firms
- This is because to earn profits, firms need to produce goods and services demanded by consumers
- Consumers 'vote' for what they want firms to produce through their purchases and 'vote' against a product by not buying them
- This helps consumers determine what and how much to produce, and firms produce only these goods at prices they are willing to accept 

- As resources are scarce and command a price, firms will devote scarce resources to produce a particular goods or service only if production is profitable
- How much of a goods is produced is determined by the price mechanism finding the price at which quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied
- Changes in price signal to producers if more/ less resources should be allocated to the production of a good

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- When consumers increase their demand for a particular good (cars) due to changes in a non-price factor (rise in income)
>- The rise in demand is indicated by their willingness and ability to pay a higher price for it
>- The rise in demand is represented by a shift in the demand curve to $DD'$, leading to a shortage of $Q_2 - Q_e$ units at the initial price, putting upward pressure on prices
>- The rise in price incentivises firms to increase quantity supplied (movement along SS curve) because it means a higher profit margin
>- It also allows them to cover the increasing marginal cost of production
>- The higher price means that firms are getting more than waht they need to cover their marignal cost of production

- This rise in profitability, as signalled by the rise in price, incentivises profit motivated firms to expand production in response to the change in preference of consumers
- The firms will enter markets for factors of production and demand for more (e.g. labour) to do so
- Thus, more resources will be channeled into the industry and more of the good will be produced

- The rise in price is also a signal and incentive for the consumer
- The rise in price that the net MB of the good is now lower and is thus a disincentive for consumers to buy the same quantity
- Graphically, this is reflected as a movement along the demand curve

- Price can also determine how a goods is produced as profit maximising firms will use the optimal mix of factors of production such as labour or capital to produce a given output
- They will react to relative factor price to determine which factor will they use more off the minimise costs
### Rationing role of prices
- Prices also serve to indicate the distribution of goods i.e. for whom to produce
- In their pursuit of profits, firms will sell their output only to those who are willing and able to pay a price that at least covers the marginal cost of production incurred
- The goods will be distributed to consumers who have the willingness and ability to pay the market equilibrium price

### How it achieves allocative efficiency
##### Consumers
- Rational consumer will seek to maximise the net total private benefits from buying and consuming a good/ service given his limited income
- He will buy an additional unit of good so as long as the marginal private benefit of consuming it does not exceed its marginal private cost
- The MPB is the additional utility derived from consuming an additional unit of the goods (i.e. marginal utility/ satisfaction)
- The MPC is the additional cost of consuming one more unit of the goods, which is how much the consumer pay for the goods
- The demand curve represents the maximum price consumers are willing and able to pay for various quantities of the goods
- The maximum price a consumer would be willing to pay for one more unit of a goods would represent the marginal utility that he derives from consuming that additional unit
- The market demand curve is therefore the same as the MPB curve for consumers
#### Producers
- The supply curve represents the minimum price that producers are willing and able to accept for various quantities of the goods
- A rational producer will maximise total profits
- He will be willing to sell an additional unit of the goods as long as the MPB of producing it exceed the MPC
- The MPB is the additional revenue from selling an additional unit of the good, which is equal to the price consumers pay in a perfectly competitive market
- The MPC is the additional cost of producing one more unit of the good (i.e. marginal cost of production)
- The minimum price a producer would be willing to accept to produce one more unit of a good represents the marginal cost of production
- The market supply curve is therefore the same as the MPC curve of consumers
#### Assumptions
- ==Assuming no externalities==, the MPC incurred buy firms is the same as the MSC (marginal social cost) incurred by society as a whole
- The MPB enjoyed by consumers will be same as the MSB (marginal social benefit) incurred by society as a whole
- As such, in a ==perfectly competitive market== for a ==private good==, the demand curve will reflect both MPB and MSB and the supply curve will reflect MPC and MSC
![[allocative efficiency in the free market.png]]
- As such, the market equilibrium point $e$ is also the socially optimal equilibrium, where MSB = MSC
- At $Q_e$, society's welfare is maximised, and allocative efficiency is achieved
#### Consider what if market output is less than/ more than
- Output is less than $Q_e$, i.e. at $Q_1$
	- For units $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, the MSB is greater than the MSC
	- For every additional unit of output from $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, the additional benefit to society is greater than the additional cost incurred
	- Total social benefit -> Area $beQ_eQ_1$, Total social cost -> Area $ceQ_eQ_1$
	- There will be a net increase in society's welfare of area $bec$ that could be gained if ($Q_e - Q_1$ units were consumed
	- Thus, society's welfare is not maximised and allocative efficiency is not achieved
- Output is more than $Q_e$, i.e. at $Q_2$
	- For units $Q_e$ to $Q_2$, the MSC is greater than the MSB
	- For every additional unit of output from $Q_e$ to $Q_2$, the additional benefit to society is lesser than the additional benefit incurred
	- Total social benefit -> Area $eyQ_2Q_E$, Total social cost -> Area $exQ_2Q_e$
	- There is a net loss in society's welfare of area $xeY$ that is incurred because ($Q_2- Q_e$) units were consumed
	- Thus, society's welfare is not maximised and allocative efficiency is not achieved
### Allocative efficiency using CS/PS
- At the market equilibrium output $Q_e$ where the demand and supply curves intersect, the sum of consumer and producer surplus is maximised, hence society's welfare is maximised and allocative efficiency is achieved
