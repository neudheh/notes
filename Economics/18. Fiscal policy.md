## Government budget
$$Government\ budget = Tax\ revenue - Government\ spending$$
- Government spending consists of government expenditure and transfer payments
- Government expenditure refers to direct expenditure undertaken by the government on goods and services
- Government expenditure ($G$) contributes to AD and is included in the GDP
- Transfer payments are funds paid to individuals by the government for which it receives no goods and services in return
- These include unemployment benefits, income support payments, and bursaries for students
- Transfer payments will not directly increase AD as they do not contribute towards demand for final goods and services
- Transfer payments indirectly increases AD when households spend the transfer payments received on final goods and services, increasing AD through $C$
- Government tax revenue comes from direct taxes and indirect taxes
- Direct taxes refer to taxes imposed on all forms of income and is paid directly to the government, such as personal income tax and corporate tax
- Indirect taxes refer to a compulsory levy imposed on the sale of goods and services, such as GST
- When a government runs a budget deficit, it can be financed by using past accumulated reserves
- In the future, the government will has less reserves to spend, or tax revenue will have to be diverted to pay for the resulting debt and the interest incurred
- There will be less financial resources in the future for the government so spend on social and developmental needs
- There is an intergenerational transfer of welfare from future generations to current ones
- Excessive fiscal debt may result in the government's creditors becoming fearful that the government will default on its debt, triggering capital flight
- This can create severe macroeconomic instability, thus the government may need to undertake painful austerity measures that have a contractionary effect on the economy
## Expansionary fiscal policy
- ==An expansionary fiscal policy would involved reducing direct tax and/ or increasing government spending==
- This is to address the problems of negative actual growth (recession)and demand-deficient unemployment due to a fall in demand for domestic goods and services
- It can also be used to combat demand-side deflation
- Governments can increase government expenditure ($G$) component of AD by building infrastructure such as roads
- Governments can increase the consumption expenditure ($C$) component of AD by giving more transfer payments such as cash vouchers to households
- This will increase disposable income and their purchasing power, and they will demand more consumer goods and services
- Governments can increase the consumption expenditure ($C$) and investment expenditure ($I$) components of AD by cutting direct taxes
- Lower income tax means that households will have higher disposable income, increasing their purchasing power
- They will spend more on consumers goods and services to satisfy their wants
- Lower corporate tax will increase the post-tax expected rate of returns on investment
- With higher returns on investments, firms will be incentivized to increase investment expenditure, and will buy more capital goods

- This would increase AD and lead to a rightward shift in AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- Firms will see an unplanned fall in inventories, and will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- Household's income will increase, and they will spend a portion of it domestic goods and services, leading to a rise in induced consumption
- This causes AD to shift from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- This leads to another unplanned fall in inventories, and further increases in production and more FOPs being hired, resulting in another cycle of spending
- There would be a multiplied increased in real GDP to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier effect
- There is actual economic growth as illustrated by a rise in real GDP form $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- There is also a fall in demand deficient unemployment as derived demand for labor increases as firms increase output
## Contractionary fiscal policy
- ==A contractionary fiscal policy involves raising direct taxes, and/or decreasing government spending==
- This is usually done to tackle demand-pull inflation
- Government can decrease the government expenditure ($G$) of AD by building lesser infrastructure such as roads
- Governments can decrease the consumption expenditure ($C$) by decreasing transfer payments, reducing household's disposable income and purchasing power
- Households will demand lesser consumer goods and services
- Governments can decrease the consumption expenditure ($C$) and investment expenditure ($I$) by raising direct taxes
- Higher income taxes means that households will have lesser disposable income and purchasing power
- They are less likely to spend on consumer goods/ services to satisfy their wants
- Higher corporate taxes reduce the post-tax rate of returns on investment
- With lower returns on investment, firms will likely lower their investment expenditure
![[demand side deflation.png]]
- This would decrease AD, causing it it to shift to the left from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- There would be an unplanned rise in inventories, and decrease production by hiring lesser FOPs
- Households income will decrease, and they will spend lesser of it on domestic goods and services, decreasing induced consumption
- This causes AD to shift from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- This leads to another unplanned rise in inventories, and further decreases in production, and lesser FOPs being hired, resulting in another fall in spending
- There will be a multiplied fall in real GDP form $Y_1$ to $Y_3$ due to the reverse multiplier effect
- The resulting rise in unemployment as reflected by the output gap $Y_1 - Y_3$ means that firms are better able to get the resources that they need
- This results in more efficient factor combinations and falling unit costs of production, reducing inflationary pressure
### How fiscal policy can achieve inclusive or sustainable growth
- To achieve inclusive growth, the expansionary fiscal policy to increase AD will need to bring about improved income equality and greater equity in the country
- One method could be having targeted transfer payment for the lower income/ skilled and income tax cuts for the lower income groups
- This will increase consumption and thus AD, and also improve the welfare of the less-well off
- Another method is to increase taxes on the rich and provide greater transfer payment to the poor
- This redistribution of income will lead to greater inclusive growth
- There will be an increase in real output as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is higher for the poor
- The rise in consumption from the poor due to the additional transfer payment would exceed the fall in consumption from the rich due to the fall in disposable income form increased income taxes
- Overall, AD will rise
- To achieve sustainable growth, the fiscal policy measures adopted will need to encourage or utilise sustainable methods of production
- This could include increased government spending on green energy efforts such as solar panels
- This will increase AD and AS, and ensure that the energy industry will emit lesser pollution, creating a cleaner environment and a more sustainable future
## Evaluation
### Crowding out effect
- Crowding out effect occurs when the government has to borrow in order to finance the government expenditure
- This happens when the government has become debt-ridden from years of fiscal budget deficit and do not have enough sufficient fiscal reserves to fund its fiscal plans
- This borrowing by the government will result in an increase in the demand for loanable funds, leading to an increase in interest rates
- Higher interest rates would increase the cost of borrowing
- Households would have more incentive to save, and borrowers will borrow less to spend on goods and services, causing consumption to fall
- Firms will cut back on investments as the rate of return on investments for some projects is now lower than the cost of investment, the interest rate
- Thus, the increase in government spending will be offset by lower $C$ and $I$
- Hence, expansionary fiscal policy may be less effective for governments that have to finance the increase in government expenditure through borrowing
### Size of multiplier
- The effectiveness of fiscal policy is limited if countries have a small multiplier
- It will be difficult for fiscal policy to raise output and employment levels for countries with a small multiplier due to a higher propensity to withdraw (more leakages)
- For the US, which has a consumerist culture, MPC is high, meaning that it has a large multiplier
- Fiscal policy will be effective in influencing output and employment
- In contrast, a country like Singapore, which has a small and open economy and is resource-poor, would have a high MPM as we are heavily reliant on imports
- MPS is high due to asian frugality and CPF
- As such, there is a high MPW and a weak multiplier effect, limiting the effectiveness of expansionary fiscal policy to stimulate the economy
### Size of the domestic sector
- An expansionary policy aimed at increasing $C$ and $I$ through lower direct taxes might not have much impact on a country with a small domestic sector
- In Singapore, domestic consumption expenditure only accounts for 37% of the GDP
- In contrast, a policy would be more impact on a country with a larger domestic sector like Australia where domestic consumption expenditure accounts for 58% of the GDP
- The impact of the fiscal policy is limited if the government sector and domestic private sector is small relative to the export sector
- When Singapore is hit by a global recession, government expenditure will be increased, but it will not be enough to make up for the fall in export revenue $X$
- This is because external demand makes up a far larger percent of our GDP
### Consumer and investor confidence
- Given poor consumer sentiments and uncertainty in economic outlook, consumers may be worried about job security and expect falls in future income
- They may withhold consumption and increase precautionary savings
- Consumers may also believe that any tax cuts now could worsen the budget position, and bring about tax rises in the future if the government finances any debt with loaning
- They may thus not spend the increase in disposable income arising from the tax cuts
- Firms may be pessimistic about their expected rate of returns on investment
- With poor consumer sentiments and expected fall in sales, firms may see little incentive in expanding their capacity to produce
- As such, low confidence in the economy during a recession would make consumption and investment unresponsive to tax cuts, limiting the rise in AD
