## Government budget
- A government can use fiscal policy, which involves changing the level of taxation and government spending in order to influence the AD and the level of economic activity
$$Government\ b udget = Tax\ revenue - Goverment\ spending$$
- Government spending consists of **government expenditure** (G) and **transfer payments**
### Government expenditure
- Government expenditure is direct expenditure by the government on good and services
- This contributes to AD and is included in GDP
- They may also expand the productive capacity of economy, leading to an increase in AS
- E.g. Spending on healthcare, defense and infrastructure
### Transfer payments
- Transfer payments are funds paid to individuals for which the government receives no goods and services and return
- E.g. unemployment benefits, income supports, and government bursaries for students
- This will not directly increase AD, but they increase it indirectly
- When households receive these transfer payments, their purchasing power increases, and they demand more goods, causing C to rise, which causes AD to rise
### Tax revenue
- Direct taxes are taxes imposed on all forms of income and is paid directly to the government (e.g. income tax, corporate tax)
- Indirect taxes are compulsory levies imposed on the sale of goods and services, such as GST and tobacco taxes
### Government budget deficit
- When a government runs a budget deficit, it can be financed by drawing on the reserves, or through borrowing
- In the future, government will have less reserves to spend, or tax revenues will have to diverted to pay for the resulting debt and interest incurred
- As there are less financial resources available in the future to spend on social and development needs, there would be a fall in material standard of living in the future
- Furthermore, excessive debt may cause the governments creditors to be fearful that the government will default on its debt
- This triggers capital flight, which can create severe macroeconomic instability
- To avoid such measures, a country may need to undertake painful austerity (contractionary) measures to restore investor confidence
## Expansionary fiscal policy
- Expansionary fiscal policy involves reducing direct taxes and increasing government spending
- This is to address negative actual growth (recession), demand-deficient unemployment, and combat demand-side deflation
- The government can increase government expenditure component (G) of AD by building infrastructure such as roads or railway lines
- The government can increase consumption expenditure (C) component of AD by giving out transfer payments
	- This will increase households purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services, increasing C
- The government can increase consumption expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I) components of AD by lowering direct taxes
	- Households will have more disposable income, increasing households purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services, increasing C
	- Firms will see a rise in post-tax expected rate of returns, and firms will invest more as more units of investment which were previously unprofitable are now profitable

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[expansionary fiscal policy.png]]
>- By adopting a expansionary fiscal policy, this would increase AD and lead to a rightward shift in AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ as G, C, and I increase
>- This will cause an unplanned fall in inventories, and firms would increase production  by hiring more factors of production, increasing the factor income that they pay out
>- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
>- There is higher induced consumption
>- This leads to a another fall in inventories, and firms will further increase production and hire more FOPs, resulting in another cycle of spending
>- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
>- There is a multiplied increase in national income from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier process, assuming spare capacity in the economy
>- There will be actual economic growth shown by a rise in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
>- There is also a fall in demand-deficient unemployment as derived demand for labour also rises as firms increase output
## Contractionary fiscal policy
- A contractionary fiscal policy involves raising direct taxes and/ or decreasing government spending
- Used to tackle demand-pull inflation, when the economy is booming and approaching full employment
- The government can decrease government expenditure component (G) of AD by building lesser infrastructure such as roads or railway lines
- The government can decrease consumption expenditure (C) component of AD by giving out lesser transfer payments
	- This will decrease households purchasing power, and they will demand lesser goods and services, decreasing C
- The government can decrease consumption expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I) components of AD by raising direct taxes
	- Households will have lesser disposable income, decreasing households purchasing power, and they will demand lesser goods and services, decreasing C
	- Firms will see a fall in post-tax expected rate of returns, and firms will invest lesser as more units of investment which were previously profitable are now unprofitable

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand side deflation.png]]
>- By adopting a contractionary fiscal policy, this would decrease AD and lead to a leftward shift in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ as G, C, and I decrease
>- This will cause an unplanned rise in inventories, and firms would decrease production by hiring lesser factors of production, lowering the factor income that they pay out
>- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
>- There is lower induced consumption
>- This leads to a another rise in inventories, and firms will further decrease production and hire lesser FOPs, resulting in another cycle of spending
>- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
>- There is a multiplied decrease in national income from $Y_0$ to $Y_2$ due to the reverse multiplier process, assuming spare capacity in the economy
>- There is a rise in unemployment, as seen by the output gap $Y_0 - Y_2$
>- This means that firms are better able to get the resources they need, and can have more efficient combinations of factors of production
>- Thus, there will be lesser inflationary pressure as the unit cost of production fell, and GPL fall is the economy was near or at full employment previously


### Inclusive Growth
- To achieve inclusive growth, the **expansionary** fiscal policy that is adopted to increase AD will need to increase income equality and equity
- This can be done through targeted transfer payments for the lower income, or income tax cuts for lower income groups
- This will increase consumption and thus AD, but also ensure the welfare of those less well-off will be raised
- To achieve inclusive growth through **expansionary** fiscal policy, it will need to lower AD and increase income equality and equity
- This can be done through increased taxes on the rich and more transfer payments for the poor
- There will be a increase in real output as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is higher for the poor
- Thus, the rise in consumption by the poor from the additional transfer payments will exceed the fall in consumption by the rich due to a fall in disposable income
- Thus, C rises and AD rises
### Sustainable growth
- To encourage sustainable growth, the policies need to encourage or utilize sustainable methods of production
- This can be done through the government spending on green energy efforts such as solar panels
- This will increase AD and AS, but also ensure that there is lesser pollution emitted, creating a cleaner environment and ensuring a more sustainable future
## Evaluation
### Crowding out effect
- The crowding out effect occurs when the government has to borrow in order to finance the government expenditure
- This happens when governments have been debt-ridden for years of fiscal budget deficits and do not have enough reserves to fund its fiscal plans
- The borrowing by the government will result in an increase in the demand for loanable funds, which will lead to an increase in interest rates
- This increases the cost of borrowing, giving households more incentive to save, and borrowers to borrow lesser to spend on goods and services, lowering C
- Firms will cut back on investments as the cost of investment has risen, causing some previously profitable units of investment to now become unprofitable, lowering I
- Thus the increase in government spending will be offset by lower C and I
- Government spending drives up interest rates, leading to a fall in household consumption and investment expenditure as the cost of borrowing has increased
- Hence, expansionary fiscal policy is less effective for governments that have to finance the increase in government expenditure through borrowing
### Size of multiplier
- The effectiveness of a fiscal policy is limited if a country has a small multiplier, as it will be difficult for fiscal policy to raise output and employment levels
- This is due to a higher propensity to withdraw
- The US has a high $MPC_d$, and the multiplier effect is large, and fiscal policy can be effective in influencing output and employment
- Singapore has a small $MPC_d$, and the multiplier effect is small, and fiscal policy us limited in effectively influencing output and employment
### Size of domestic sector
- An expansionary fiscal policy aimed at increasing C and I through lower direct taxes would be limited in a country with a small domestic sector
- If the government sector and the domestic sector is small relative to an export sector, the fiscal policy would be even more limited
- If Singapore is hit by a global recession, the increase in government will not be enough to make up for the fall in export revenue as it takes up a large % of our GDP
### Consumer/ Investor confidence
- Given poor consumer sentiments and uncertainty economic outlook, consumers may be worried about job security and expect falls in future income
- Consumers may withhold consumption and increase precautionary savings
- Additionally, any tax cuts now would only worsen the budget position, and will only bring about tax increases in the future 
- This is because the government needs to repay its debts, and might do so through borrowing
- Thus, consumers may not spend the increase in disposable income arising from the tax cut
---
- Firms may be pessimistic about their expected rate of returns, as there is poor consumer sentiments and expected fall in sales
- There is little incentive in expanding their capacity to produce, hence they will not invest
- As such, low confidence in the economy during a recession would make consumption and investment unresponsive to tax cuts, limiting a governments ability to stimulate AD
