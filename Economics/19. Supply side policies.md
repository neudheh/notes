## How do supply side policies help
### Increasing productive capacity
- To achieve sustained economic growth, governments use supply-side. policies that increase the productivity and efficiency of the economy
- These increase the country's productive capacity
![[Pasted image 20240425231856.png]]
- These policies causes AS to increase, which is seen as a rightward shift of the vertical AS curve from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
- Economies that were near or at full employment would enjoy a fall in GPL
- There is an increase in GDP due to a movement along AD through the wealth, interest rate and international substitution effect
- Thus, this helps to reduce inflation and achieves sustained growth
### Decreasing UCOP
- Governments use supply-side policies that reduce the unit cost of production, to generate actual growth
![[Pasted image 20240606005045.png]]
- This will cause AD to increase and horizontal AS will shift downwards from $AS_3$ to $AS_4$
- Firms will pass on the falls in costs to consumers by lowering the prices of goods and services, leading to a fall in GPL
- Assuming spare capacity, there is an increase in GDP due to a movement along AD through the wealth, interest rate and international substitution effect
- Thus, there will be actual growth
### Reducing unemployment
- Certain supply-side policies help to reduce structural unemployment
- Skills retraining schemes reduce structural unemployment by increasing the occupational mobility of workers
- By equipping retrenched workers with relevant skills, skills mismatch is reduced, hence structural unemployment is reduce
### Reducing BOT deficit
- Supply side policies that increase AS and lower prices in the economy help to increase the price competitiveness of a country's exports
- Assuming demand for exports is price elastic, the fall in export prices would lead to a rise in export revenue, improving BOT
## Increasing the quantity of labour
### Increasing the retirement age/ re-employment age
- This increases the number of people who can remain employed and thus the labour force is expanded
- Extending the retirement age means firms are obliged to keep their older workers employed for a longer period
- This maintains the size of the labour force
- If extending the retirement age encouraged those who have already retired to return to the labor force, as it is easier to get jobs, there will be a rise in the quantity of labor
### Removing barriers to labour flows
- To increase the quantity of labour, a government can loosen its immigration policy
- By making it easier for employers to hire foreign workers, this will increase the quantity of labour, and increase the productive capacity
- But, there could be overcrowding on public transport and housing shortages if the public and social infrastructure cannot accommodate the influx of foreigners
- It can slow down restructuring of the economy as firms are less likely to adopt more efficient capital-intensive methods of production when cheap foreign labour is available
- Thus, this may slow potential growth due to weak productivity growth
### Reducing income tax
- Lower income tax increases individuals disposable income
- This provides an incentive for people to work longer hours and join the labour force, and attracts foreigners
- Thus, the quantity of labour and productive capacity increases
- If highly skilled foreign talents are attracted by the lower income tax rates, the quality of labor will improve as well
- Assuming wages remain constant, this results in a fall in UCOP
## Increasing the quantity of capital
### Reducing corporate tax rates
- Reducing corporate tax rates would lead to increases in capital stock as it encouraged domestic and foreign direct investments (FDI)
- Local and foreign firms will find it more attractive to invest in the country as they enjoy a higher post-tax return on investment
- This increases the quantity and quality of capita, increasing productive capacity
- But, governments with a budget deficit and high level of public debt face difficulties in cutting corporate taxes as this will result in bigger budget deficits
- There will be greater income inequality as owners of firms (e.g. shareholders) are the wealthier households in the country who have funds to buy share in companies
- Cuts in corporate taxes would lead to more distributed profits for shareholders, leading to greater income inequality
### Removing/ reducing restrictions to capital flows
- Government can encourage FDI by removing or reducing restrictions on FDIs
- With the absence of barriers, foreign firms will find it easier and more profitable to invest in different sectors of the economy
- This increases the quantity and quality of capital, increasing productive capacity
- As investment expenditure is a component of AD, there will be a rise in AD and sustained economic growth
- But, heavy reliance on FDIs might result in an economy that is susceptible to external shocks
- There will be adverse impacts on employments and economic growth should the FDI suddenly pull out due to global debt crisis, or conflicts between major trading partners
- FDI leads to structural changes in the economy, leading to structural unemployment and rising income inequality
### Government spending on infrastructure
- The state may spend on increasing the quality of infrastructure (e.g. highways), increasing capital stock and productive capacity
- AD also rises when the government spends on infrastructure as G is a part of AD, and with both AD and AS rising, there is sustained growth
- Increased spending on infrastructure can help businesses reduce costs and improve efficiency, lowering the unit cost of production for the whole economy
- This increases AD, further boosting actual growth
- But, infrastructure takes years to complete
## Increasing the quality of labour
### Subsidising or direct provision of education
- The government can subsidise or directly provide education
- It can set up vocation and tertiary institutions focusing on technical education (e.g. polytechnics)
- Education improves the quality of labor, increasing the productivity of labour
- Assuming wages remain constant, increases in labour productivity will decrease the unit cost of production
- A more educated workforce is more productive, flexible and occupationally mobile, which attracts FDI, increasing investment, and AD
- With both AD and AS rising, there is sustained growth
- But, education takes a long period of time, and it will take many years for it to have effects
- There is also no guarantee that the skills taught now will still be relevant in the future
### Subsidising training and upgrading of skills
- The government can provide training facilities or subsidies to encourage workers to go for further training and upgrade themselves
- This will raise the quality of labour as workers are able to generate more output per man hour, increasing productive capacity and AS
- Assuming wages remain constant, the increase in labour productivity will lower the unit cost of production in the country
- Left to the free market, private firms may not provide enough vocational training as workers may leave them and join their competitors after they have been trained
- The rise in labour productivity would increase demand for labour, enabling more people to obtain jobs and earn higher wage rate, improving income distribution in the country
- Thus, there is inclusive growth
- But, this can put a strain on the governments budget
- There is great resistance to learning new skills, especially for older workers who are reluctant or unable to be trained, thus it will take for training to take effect
## Increasing the quality of capital
### Policies that encourage R&D
- Governments can provide grants, subsidies and tax/incentive to firms to encourage R&D
- This will lower the marginal cost of conducting R&D, and incentivises firms to conduct more R&D
- There will be more innovation and advancements in technology, improving the quality of capital, and increases the productive capacity of the economy
- Governments can fund R&D efforts in developing green technology, improving methods of production that are also cleaner, resulting in sustainable growth
- But, R&D is not guaranteed to be successful, and takes years
- There needs to be proper intellectual property rights in place to prevent rivals from copying and using the technology and innovation it has development
- Thus, the government needs to establish and enforce strong patent laws too
## Reducing the cost of production
### Increasing productivity of workers
- Government policies at improving the quality of workers (e.g. skills retraining) improves worker's productivity
- Assuming no change in wage rates, higher labour productivity results in lower unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and horizontal AS to shift downwards
### Controlling prices
- In times of imported inflation or currency depreciation, the government can implement price controls to reduce cost-pus inflation (e.g. cost push inflation)
- This can lower the unit cost of production of the economy
- But, a price ceiling would result in shortages as the market clearing price cannot be attained, resulting in allocative inefficiency
### Controlling wages
- Removing the minimum wage allows the labor market to function more efficiently
- Wage rates would be reduced to the equilibrium wage rate, lowering unit cost of production
- Trade unions might bargain for wage increases that worker's productivity growth, increasing unit cost of production, leading to cost push inflation
- The government can reduce cost-push inflation by tempering the trade unions ability to demand higher wages or resist wage cuts
- E.g. Introduce more flexible wage models that allow employers to reduce wages in a recession
- When firms can cut wage rates in a recession, there is lesser need for them to retrench workers, reducing the severity of demand-deficient unemployment
- The removal of minimum wage allows the labour market to be more efficient, as the surplus of labour is cleared, allowing allocative efficiency to be achieved
- But, the removal of the minimum wage is unpopular
- Trade unions may also be a significantly portion of the electorate, and policies that impact the trade unions members may cause them to vote for opposition parties
- Thus, governments avoid such policies to not lose voters
## Increasing mobility of factors of production
- Workers who are retrenched but do not have the skills the skills required to join growing industries may become structurally unemployed
- Government subsidies for training and skills upgrading can allow retrenched workers to equip themselves with relevant new skills
- This allows them to be more mobile between occupations, and they can find jobs in growing industries, reducing structural unemployment
- But, the training of a worker is not immediate and it will take time before the workers acquire a skillset
- As with most training programmes, the success of the training programme depends on how receptive workers are to it
