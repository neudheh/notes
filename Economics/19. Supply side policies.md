- Supply-side policies are policies that increase the productivity and efficiency of the economy
- They
	- Increase the quantity and/or improve the quality of factors of production
	- Reduce the unit cost of production
	- Improve mobility of factors of production
	- Increase efficiency and remove barriers to competition and trade in foreign markets
## Effects of supply-side policies
### Increase the productive capacity
- To achieve sustained economic growth, governments use supply-side policies that increase the productivity and efficiency of the economy to raise productive capacity
- This would cause AS to increase, and cause vertical AS to shift to the right from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
- Economies that were initially near or at full employment enjoy a fall in the GPL, increasing real GDP
- There is actual growth through the wealth, interest rate, and international substitution effect
- The increase in productive capacity also reduces inflationary pressures and allows for sustained growth

### Decrease the UCOP
- Governments can reduce the unit cos of production, increasing AS and causing horizontal AS to shift down from $AS_3$ to $AS_4$
- Firms will then pass on the cost savings by lowering the price of their goods and services, leading to a fall in GPL
- Economies that have spare capacity will experience actual growth through the wealth, interest rate, and international substitution effect
- Cost-push inflation is also reduced

### Reducing unemployment
- Some supply-side polices, like skills retraining reduces structural unemployment by increasing the occupational mobility of workers
- By equipping retrenched workers with relevant skills, skills mismatch is reduced, and structural unemployment is reduced
### Reducing BOT deficit
- Supply-side policies that increase AS and lower prices in the economy increase the price competitiveness of exports
- Assuming demand for exports is price inelastic, the fall in export prices leads to a rise in export revenue, improving BOT
## Increasing quantity of labor
### Raising the retirement age
- This will increase the number of people who can remain employed and the labor force is expanded
- Increasing the retirement age means firms are obliged to keep their older workers in employment for a longer period
- This maintains the size of the labor force
- If extending the retirement age encourages those who have already retired to return to the labor force, there will be a rise in quantity of labor
### Removing barriers to labor flows
- To increase the quantity of labor, a government can encourage the inflow of skilled and unskilled foreign labor by loosening its immigration policy
- This will increase the quantity of labor causing productive capacity to increase
- But, it could lead to overcrowding on public transport and housing shortages if the social infrastructure is not ready to accommodate a influx of foreigners into the country
- It may also slow down the restructuring of the economy if firms are less likely to develop capital-intensive methods of production when low-cost foreign labor is readily available
- This would slowdown potential growth due to weak productivity growth
### Reducing income tax
- Lower rates of income tax increase individual's disposable outcome
- This provides an incentive to work longer hors and join the labor force
- It would also attract more foreigners to join the labor force
- This would increase the quantity of labor and productive capacity increases
- If highly skilled foreign talents are attracted by the lower income tax rates, the quality of labor will improve as well
- Assuming wages remain constant, this results in a fall in unit cost of production
## Increasing quantity of capital
### Reducing corporate tax rate
- The reduction of corporate tax rate would help to increase capital stock as it encourages both domestic and foreign direct investments (FDI)
- Local and foreign firms find it more attractive to invest in the country because they are able to retain a relatively larger portion of their profits
- They will enjoy higher post-tax expected rate of returns on their investment, which will increase the quantity of capital and productive capacity increases
- But, countries whose governments have been running budget deficits and acquired high level of public debt will face difficulty in cutting corporate taxes
- This is because this will result in bigger budget deficits
- The cutting of corporate tax rates could lead to greater income inequality,
- This is because owners of firms are typically the wealthier households in the country, who have the funds to buy shares in companies
- Cuts in corporate taxes leads to more dividends (distributed profits) for shareholders, leading to greater income equality
- This makes economic growth less inclusive
### Removing/ reducing restrictions to capital flows
- To increase the quantity of capital stock, governments can encourage the inflow of FDI by removing or reducing current restrictions imposed on FDI
- With the absence of barriers such as limits on foreign ownership, complex rules and regulation, and screening procedures on inward FDI, foreign firms will find it easier and more profitable to invest in different sectors of the economy
- This would increase the quantity of capital, which results in the expansion in the country's productive capacity
- As investment expenditure is a part of AD, an increase in FDI would also result in a rise in AD
- With both AD and AS rising, there is sustained economic growth
- With the technology/ newer skills that comes with FDI, the quality of capital may also improve
- But, heavy reliance on FDI may result in an economy being vulnerable/ susceptible to external shocks
- There may be adverse impact on employment and economic growth should the FDI pull out due to global debt crisis or trade conflicts
- FDI will also bring about structural changes in the economy, resulting in structural unemployment and rising income inequality
### Government spending on infrastructure
- A direct way to increase the quantity of capital is through government spending
- The state may directly spend on increasing the quantity of infrastructure like highways
- This results in the increase in capital stock and productive capacity of the economy increases
- As government spending is a part of AD, AD also rises when the government spends on infrastructure
- With both AD and AS rising, national income increases substantially over time, achieving sustained growth
- Furthermore, increased spending on transport and communication networks helps businesses reduce costs and improve efficiency
- This will result in a lower unit cost of production for the economy and an increase in AS, causing horizontal AS to shift down, boosting actual growth
- But, infrastructure like transport networks takes years to complete
## Improving the quality of labor
### Subsidising or direct provision of education
- The government can subsidise education or directly providing the education services
- It can set up vocational and tertiary institutions focused on tertiary education to make it easier for workers to upgrade their skills
- Education improves the quality of human capacity, which increases productive capacity
- Assuming that wages remain constant, the increase in labor productivity will also decrease the UCOP within the country
- A better educated workforce is more flexible, productive, and occupationally mobile, which attracts FDI
- Investment rises, causing a rise in AD
- With both AD and AS rising, there is substantial growth
- But, education needs a very long gestation period and it takes many years for any education policy to take effect
- The effect of education may be felt only years after the policy is implemented
- There is no guarantee that the skills taught now would still be relevant in the future
### Subsidising training and upgrading of skills
- The government can also provide training facilities or subsidies to encourage to go for further training and upgrade themselves
- This would raise the quality of workers as workers would be able to generate more output per man hour, increasing the country's capital capacity, causing AS to increase
- Vertical AS would increase
- Assuming wages remain constant, the increase in labor productivity will also decrease the UCOP of the economy
- Left to the free market, private firms may not provide sufficient vocational training because of the possibility that workers may leave them and join their competitors
- But, this would strain the government budget
- There would be a great resistance in acquiring new skills, especially with older workers who are reluctant to train or are unable to be trained
- Thus, training of skills takes time
- But, subsidising or direct provision of education and skills upgrading would lead to a rise in the demand for labor, allowing more people to get jobs or earn higher wage rates
- This improves income distribution in the country, achieving inclusive growth
## Improving the quality of capital
### Policies that encourage R&D
- Governments can provide grants, subsidies, and tax incentives to help firms encourage R&D
- These policies will lower the marginal cost of conducting R&D, and incentivises firms to conduct more R&D
- With more R&D, there will be greater innovation and advancements in technology, improving the quality of capital and improving the productive capacity
- But, R&D takes years to complete
- R&D without the proper intellecutal property rights is to a large extent non-excludable
- There is nothing stopping from rivals from copy and using the technology and innovation that is has developed
- Hence, governments also needs to establish and enforce strong patent laws
- But, governments can funds R&D efforts involved with green technology
- If R&D is successful and there are improved methods of production that are cleaner, there would be sustainable growth
## Reduce the cost of production
### Improving productivity of workers
- Government can use policies aimed at improving the quality of workers, such as subsidies to encourage workers to go for training and skills upgrading
- This would lead to higher productivity levels and more output per man hour
- Assuming no or minimal changes in the wage rates, this would lead to a lower unit cost of production, causing AS to increase, and horizontal AS shifts downwards
### Controlling prices
- In times of imported inflation, or a sudden currency depreciation, the government can implement price controls to alleviate cost-push inflation
- A government can use price ceilings (maximum price below market price) on common FOPs such as crude oil and metals to lower the unit cost of production of the economy
- But, the implementation of price ceilings results in shortages as the market clearing price cannot be attained, resulting in allocative inefficiency
### Removing the minimum wage
- Removing the minimum wage for workers allows the labor market to function more effectively
- Wage rates would be reduced to the equilibrium wage rate, lowering the unit cost of production of firms
- It can also clear the surplus created by the minimum wage, maximising society's welfare, and there is allocative efficiency
### Reducing the power of trade unions
- Trade unions may bargain for wage increases that are higher than their worker's productivity growth
- This results in a higher unit cost of production, leading to cost-push inflation
- The government can temper the trade unions's ability to demand for higher wages or resist wage cuts
- They can use measures such as more flexible wage models that allow employers to cut wages during a recession
- When firms can cut wages in a recession, there is lesser need for them to retrench workers, preventing the severity of demand deficient unemployment in a recession
- This lowers the unit cost of production
- But, the removal of the minimum wage may be politically unpopular
## Improve mobility of factors of production
### Subsidising training and upgrading of skills
- Workers who are retrenched but do not have the skills required to join growing industries may become structurally unemployed
- Government subsidies for training and skills upgrading can allow retrenched workers to equip themselves with relevant new skills
- Workers who are able to do so will be more mobile between occupations and could then find jobs in growing industries, reducing structural unemployment
- But, the training of a worker is not immediate and it will take time before the workers acquire a skillset
- As with most training programmes, the success of the training programme depends on how receptive workers are to it
