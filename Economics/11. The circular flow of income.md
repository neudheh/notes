## 2-Sector closed economy 
- Households own all factors of production, and are consumers of goods and services produced by firms
- Firms are able to employ labour and other factors of production (FOP) in order to generate output
- Assuming prices and constant and there is sparce capacity
![[two sector cfoy.jpg]]
- Firms hire factors of production to produce goods and services (land, labour, capital, enterprise) from households, with each factor of production generating its respective income payments (wages, rent, interest, profits)
- Households provide factor services to firm and in turn spend their income on goods and services produced by firms, thus there is a circular of income between these 2 sectors
- All consumption expenditure (C) are paid back to households as income for the use factors of production (Y), hence C = Y
- Households who are factor owners spend this income on buying goods and services
- This forms the circular flow of income where households earn income from firms, and firms obtain income from households for output bough and consumed
- It can also be seen that total expenditure is equal to total income
## 4-Sector open economy
- It consists for firms, households, the foreign sector and the government, and savings takes place
- Not all income earned by households is spent on domestically produced consumer goods and services

### Withdrawals
- Withdrawals from the circular flow of income are household's income that is not passed onto domestic firm through spending on goods and services produced by these domestic firms
- Include Savings (S), Taxes (T), and import expenditure (M)
- Households will use a major portion of their income to purchase consumer goods and services from domestic firms
- But, some of it will be leaked out in the form of savings, some will be taxed by the government, and some will be used to purchase imports in an open economy
### Injections
- Injections into the circular flow of income are income receipts by domestic firms that do not arise through household's spending
- Include investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and export revenue (X)
- Savings in banks can be used to finance spending on capital goods (investment expenditure), tax revenue can be used to fund government expenditure, exports may be bought by foreigners, generating export revenue for domestic firms
### Equilibrium
- The circular flow of income is kept at a constant level where there is no tendency for change when total injections equal to total withdrawals $$I+G+X=S+T+M$$
- If withdrawals > injections, national income will contract
	- The planned expenditure of the economy is insufficient to buy up all the goods and services the firms have produced
	- Firms will see a rise in inventories, and will cut back on their output, reducing employment of factors of productions, and income of households
	- As income falls, there will be lesser withdrawals from the economy
	- This causes withdrawals to fall until equilibrium is restored when total injections equals total withdrawals 
- If injections > withdrawals, national income will increase
	- The planned expenditure is greater than the output of firms
	- Firms will se a rise in inventories, and increase output by hiring more factors of production, increasing income of households
	- As income rises, there will be more withdrawals from the economy
	- This causes withdrawals to rise until equilibrium is restored when total injections equals total withdrawals
