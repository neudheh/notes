## Macroeconomic goals
- Countries want to achieve these 4 macroeconomic goals in the long term
1. Sustainable and inclusive **economic growth**
2. Full employment (doesn't mean 0 unemployment)
3. Price stability
4. Favourable balance of trade position
- All these seek to improve the standard of living in the country
## Circular flow of income model
- The circular flow of income illustrates the relationship between various economic agents and how income flows around the economy to arrive at an equilibrium level of national income
### Two-sector (Closed) economy with no government
- The model assumes that prices are constant, there is spare capacity in the economy and the economy is a market economy (there is no government intervention)
- Households own all factors of production, and consumer goods and services produced by firms
- Firms employ labour and other factors of production in order to generate output
![[two sector cfoy.jpg]]
- Firms in order to produce goods and services, would hire factors of production (labor, land, capital, enterprise) from households, with each factor of production generating their respective income payments
- Households provide factors of production to firms and in turn, spend their income purchasing goods and services produced by firms
- Thus, there is a circular flow of income between these two key sectors
- In this simple two-sector (closed) economy consisting of only firms and households, where there are no savings, all consumption expenditure ($C$) is paid back to households as income ($Y$) for the use of factors of production
- Hence, $C = Y$
- This process forms the circular flow of income where households earn income from firms, and firms obtain income from households for the output bought and consumed
- It can also be seen that the country's total expenditure is equal to total national income
### 4-sector (Open) economy with government
- The 4-sector (open) economy is more realistic, consisting of firms, households, the foreign sector the government, and there is also savings taking place
- Not all income earned by households is spent on domestically produced consumer goods and services

#### Withdrawals
- Withdrawals ($W$) from the circular flow of income are household's income that is not passed on to domestic firms through spending on goods and services produced by domestic firms
- Include savings ($S$), taxes ($T$), and import expenditure ($M$) 
- Households will use a major portion of their income to purchase consumer goods and services from domestic firms
- Some of the income will also be saved, some of it will be taxed by the government and some of it will be used by the households to purchase imports in an open economy
#### Injections
- Injections ($I$) into the circular flow of income are income receipts by domestic firms that do not arise though households' spending
- Income can also re-enter the circular flow as injections
- Include investment expenditure ($I$) , government expenditure ($G$) and export revenue ($X$)
- Savings in banks can be loaned out to finance spending on capital goods (i.e. investment expenditures), tax revenue can be sued to fund government expenditure, and the home country's exports may also be bought by foreigners
#### Equilibrium
- The circular flow of income is kept constant level where there is no tendency for change when total injections equal to total withdrawals ($J = W$, or $I + G + X = S +T + M$)
- If $W >J$, national income will contract.
	- Planned expenditure of the economy is insufficient to buy up all the goods and services that firms have produced
	- They will see a rise in inventories, and will cut back on production
	- They will employ lesser factors of production, reducing the income of households
	- As income falls, there will be lesser withdrawals from the economy causing $W$ to fall until equilibrium is restored where $W = J$ again
- If $W < J$, national income will expand
	- Planned expenditure will be greater than the output of firms
	- Firms will see a fall in inventories and will increase production
	- They will hire more factors of productions, and pay more factor output
	- As income rises, there will be more withdrawals from the economy, causing $W$ to rise until $W = J$ again
