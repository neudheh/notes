## Unemployment rate
- The unemployed are people who are of working age without work, but are willing and able to work
- They are actively seeking employment or waiting to take up an appointment
- The unemployment rate is given by $$Unemployment\ rate = \frac{No.\ of\ unemployed}{Labour\ Force} \times 100\%$$
- In Singapore, the labor force comprises of all those aged 15 and above (working age) and a willing and able to work, and are employed or seeking employment
- They are also known as the economically active group
- This does not include students, housewives, retirees, prisoners and the disabled
### Size of the labor force
- The labor force may grow due to an increase in the size of the working age population
- It could be due to a rise in the birth rate, a fall in the death rate, or a rise in net immigration
- An influx of fresh graduates or re-entrants to the labor market will also result in a growth in the labor force
- The labor force may also grow due to a rise in the labor force participation rate $$Labor\ force\ participation\ rate = \frac{Labor\ force}{Working-age\ poulation} \times 100\%$$
- Some factors affecting the labor force participation rate are
	- The market wage rate - A rise in the rage rate would encourage more people to seek work and will persuade some to stay in the labor force
	- Social attitudes to working women - In some countries, where it is acceptable for women to work, there will be a larger labor force, and a greater labor force participation rate
	- Provision for the care of                                                               children and the elderly - The greater the availability of nursery places and retirement home, the higher the labor force participation rate
### Composition of the labor force
 - The composition of the labor force concerns the educational and skill qualifications of the labor force
 - If the workers in the labor force possess skills that are no longer in demand by the economy, it will also result in unemployment
### Labor productivity
- Among the employed, a key statistic on their efficiency rate is known as labor productivity, defined as the output per man hour
- Labor productivity is influence by the educational level and state of technology
- Higher productivity increases the demand for labor
- Assuming there is an economy-wide increase in productivity, the higher productivity makes it more attractive for the firm to increase employment
- Hence, the demand for labor increases, and the unemployment rate will decline
- The wage rate will also rise
## Demand-deficient unemployment
- ==Demand-deficient unemployment is caused by a fall in aggregate demand==
- It is also called cyclical unemployment as it fluctuates with the business cycle
- When there is a recession, cyclical unemployment is high as demand for labor falls due to weaker of lower aggregate demand
- In times of economic boom, cyclical unemployment will be low, as demand for labor rises in an economy with stronger or higher aggregate demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[IMG_5174.jpeg]]
>- Assuming the economy was initially producing at $Y_f$
>- When there is a fall at AD, firms find it hard to sell their current level of output
>- They will see a rise in inventories, and will cut back production by employing lesser factors of production
>- They will reduce their demand for labor, as labor is a derived demand as an essential factor of production
>- The fall in income will trigger cuts in spending on domestically produced goods and services due to the multiplier effect
>- Assuming the economy was operating below full employment, the fall in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ will result in the equilibrium level of output falling to $Y_1$
>- The full level employment level of output is at $Y_f$
>- The output gap $Y_f - Y_1$ reflects the difference between the actual output of the economy and its potential national output
>- This output gap indicates the presence of demand deficient employment
>
>![[IMG_5172.jpeg]]
>- Firms will cut back production due to the fall in AD, and thus will cut back on the amount of labor the employ, as demand for labor is a derived demand
>- The impact of the fall in demand for labor can be illustrated on a demand-supply diagram
>- Firms will cut back on the amount of labor employed during a recession, shifting demand of labor down from $D_1$ to $D_2$
>- But, wages did not fall down to $W_2$ as they are 'sticky' downwards
>- Hence, $L_1 - L_2$ represents the demand-deficient unemployment level at $W_1$, as the wage rate is unable to fall to clear the surplus

>[!NOTE]
>Wages are sticky downwards due to
>- Wage contracts, where employees have wages specified in their medium-term employment contracts that cannot be renegotiated immediately, because some workers are protected by trade unions
>- Employees morale, as pay cuts may affect everyones morale, and by not cutting wages of those who are not laid off, they become more productive than before
>- Fear of the best people leaving, as if employees cut salaries across the board, the better workers would feel disgruntled and will leave to find work elsewhere
### Natural rate of employment
- The natural rate of employment does not mean zero unemployment, it is only when there is no cyclical unemployment
- At the equilibrium wage rate, demand for labor is equal to the supply of labor
- But, there may be some workers hoping to find a new job between jobs, or some who are holding out, hoping to find a better job with higher wages and working conditions
- Therefore, at full employment, there can be some unemployment in the form of frictional, structural, and seasonal unemployment
- This is known as the natural rate of unemployment - the unemployment rate that would still exist even when there is no demand-deficient unemployment
## Structural unemployment
- Structural unemployment is caused by structural changes in the economy and occupational immobility that results in workers being unemployed for long periods of time
- This is because they cannot find jobs that require their particular skills, a mismatch of skills between the unemployed and the skills required by producers
### Changes in the method of production
- New technology and techniques of production allow the same level of output to be produced with fewer workers
- But, with new technology, it may result in certain jobs and skills becoming obsolete, displacing redundant workers
- It can create new jobs, such as workers needed to operate new machinery, but many of the unemployed are unable to fill these new posts as their old skills may not be applicable
- Occupational immobility of labor is a particular problem with structural unemployment
- It is where existing skills are no longer needed, and those retrenched do not posses the skills that are demand to take up jobs in other sectors of the economy
### Globalization
- Some labor intensive industries, especially in developed countries which use to have comparative advantage in production, can no longer compete effectively with developing countries due to rising labor costs
- In response to rising globalization, some countries may choose to restructure their economy to develop new industries in order to stay competitive in the global market
- Workers working in these sunset industries may not have the relevant skills to move on to these sunrise industries and become unemployed
### Changes in the pattern of demand
- Some industries experience declining demand, due to a change in consumer tastes, where certain goods go out of fashion
- It could also be due to competition from other industries, leading to unemployment in the industry facing falling demand
## Frictional unemployment
- Frictional unemployment is when workers leave their jobs or leave schools and are unemployed for a period of time while they find a job
- It occurs because it takes time for people who have left their previous jobs or have just entered the labor force to find jobs
- Employers may not take the first candidate and continue searching, hoping to find a better candidate for the job
- Workers may not take the first job they are offered and may continue searching, hoping they will receive a better job offer
- The worker could take the first job offer he gets, but it might not make the best use of his skills, resulting in lower productivity
- Hence, it is better for the individual to take some time to find the right job, so that resources are more efficiently allocated and better utilized
### Imperfect information
- Workers are not fully informed of what jobs are available and what they entail, and employers are not fully informed on what labor is available
- Both employers and workers have to search
- Workers search for the right job while employers searching for the right labor
- Frictional unemployment can be reduced by providing better job information so that the labor market is able to match people efficiently to jobs they like most and are suited for
- The better the economy is doing, the lower the frictional unemployment as people are usually more able to finds jobs that suit them when the economy is doing well
### Incentive problems
- People looking for a new job may not want to be employed if they believe the tax and benefit system will reduce the net increase income from taking work
## Consequences of unemployment 
### Households
- A loss in income for the unemployed lowers purchasing power, and hence consumption of goods and services, lowering material standard of living
- Rising unemployment leads to worries about possible loss of income sources, increasing anxiety, lowering non-material standard of living
- When rising unemployment leads to increase in crime rates, sense of peace of mind is diminished with lower non-material standards of living
### Firms
- Lower consumption due to loss of income or worsening of consumer confidence, leading to lower production and sales of goods and services, resulting in lower revenue
### Government
- Loss of tax revenue as the unemployed do not pay income tax and receipts from other forms of taxes like GST also decrease as the unemployed spend less
- Administrative costs due to running welfare offices, increasing government expenditure as more unemployment benefits are given out
- With falling tax revenue and rising government expenditure, the governments budget balance worsens
- If it was already in deficit, it would lead to a rising budget deficit and the government would have to borrow more
### Economy
- The economy suffers from productive inefficiency, in terms of wasted, unused labor resources
- The existence of idle resources means that the economy will be at a point inside the PPC, preventing society's welfare from being maximized
- Unemployment hurts business confidence, causing investments to fall, as the expect rate of return on investments is low, causing AD to fall
- There would be a downward multiplier effect on the country's GDP
- It also slows potential growth as the country's capital stock rises more slowly assuming the rate of accumulation of capital stock exceeds the rate of capital depreciation
- High prolonged unemployment may create other costs to society (e.g. strikes, begging, juvenile delinquency, and crimes, causing a loss in tourism and profits of firms)
