## Unemployment rate
$$Unemployment\ rate=\frac{No.\ of\ unemployed}{Labor\ force}\times 100\%$$
- The unemployed are people of working age who are without work, but are willing and able to seek work, and are actively seeking employment
### Size of the labor force
- The labor force can grow because of an increase in the size of the working age population
- This can be due to a rise in birth rate, fall in death rate, or rise in net immigration
- An influx of fresh graduates or re-entrants to the labor market will also result in the growth of the labor force
---
- A rise in wage rates would encourage more people to seek work and persuade some to stay in the labor force, past the retirement age
- In countries where it is acceptable for women to work, there will be a larger labor force and greater labor force participation rate
- The greater the availability of nursery places and retirement homes, the higher the labor force participation rate
### Composition of labor force
- The composition of the labor force can also affect the unemployment rate
- The composition of the work force is concerned about the educational and skill qualifications of the work force
- If workers in the economy posses skills that are no longer in demand by the economy, it will result in unemployment
### Labor productivity
- Labor productivity is the output produced per man hour
- It is influenced by the educational level and the state of technology
- If there is an economy-wide increase in productivity, the higher productivity makes it more attractive for the firm to increase employment, increasing demand for labor
- The unemployment rate will decline in response to the increase in productivity, causing the wage rate to rise
## Demand-deficient unemployment
- Demand deficient unemployment is caused by a fall in aggregate demand
- It is also called cyclical unemployment as it fluctuates with the business cycle
- In a recession, cyclical unemployment is high as demand for labor falls due to weaker or lower AD
- In a boom, cyclical unemployment is low as demand for labor rises in an economy with stronger or higher AD

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[IMG_5174.jpeg]]
>- The economy was initially producing at $Y_f$
>- When there is a fall in AD, firms will see a rise in inventories, and will cut back on production, reducing their demand for labor
>- The fall in national income will trigger cuts in spending on domestically produced goods/ services due to the multiplier effect
>- Assuming the economy is below full employment, the fall in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ will cause equilibrium level of output to fall to $Y_1$
>- The output gap $Y_f-Y_1$ reflects a difference between the actual output of the economy and its potential national output
>- This indicates the presence of demand-deficient employment\
>
>![[IMG_5172.jpeg]]
>- Firms will cut back on the labor employed in times of recession, shifting the demand for labor from $D_{L1}$ to $D_{L2}$
>- But, wages did not fall to $W_2$ as wages are sticky
>- Hence, $L_1-L_2$ represents the demand deficient unemployment level at $W_1$
>- The wage rate is unable to clear the surplus


>[!NOTE]
> Wages are sticky downwards due to 
>1. Wage contracts - Employees have wages specified in contracts that cannot be negotiated immediately as they are protected by trade unions
>2. Morale - Retrenchments only affect a minority, while pay cuts affect everyone's morale; by not cutting wages of those that are not retenched, productivity increases
>3. Fear of the best leaving - If an employment cuts salaries across the board, the better workers would feel disgruntled and will leave to find work elsewhere

### Natural rate of unemployment
- Full employment does not mean zero unemployment, it just means there is no cyclical unemployment
- At the equilibrium wage rate, demand for labour is equal to the supply of labour
- There could be some workers who are searching for a new job, or holding out for a better job with higher wages or better working conditions
- At full employment, there can be some employment in the form of frictional, structural, and seasonal, known as the natural rate of unemployment 
- It is the unemployment rate that would exist, even without any demand-deficient unemployment
## Structural unemployment
- Structural unemployment is caused by structural change and occupational immobility, resulting in workers being unemployed for long periods
- They cannot find that matches their skills, there is a mismatch of skills between the unemployed and skills required by producers
### Changes in methods of production
- Newer technology and techniques of production allow the same level of output to be produced with fewer workers
- This can result in certain jobs and skills becoming obsolete, displacing redundant workers
- It can also create new jobs, but the unemployed are unable to fill these new posts as their old skills may not be applicable
- Occupational immobility is where the existing skills are no longer required adn the unemployed do not posses the skills to take up jobs in other sectors of the economy
### Globalization
- Labour-intensive industries, especially in developed countries which used to have comparative advantage in production, can no longer compete effectively with developing countries due to higher labour costs
- With rising globalisation, some countries may restructure their economy to develop new industries to stay competitive in the global market
- Workers working in these declining/ sunset industries may not have the relevant skills to move into sunrise industries, and become unemployed
### Changes in demand
- Some industries experience falling demand due to a change in consumers tastes or competition form other industries, leading to unemployment
- Consumers would switch to other industries, and they will see rising demand, but the unemployed do not posses the skills to take up jobs in these industries
## Frictional unemployment
- Frictional unemployment is when workers are unemployed for a period of time while they are searching for a job
- It takes time for people who have left their jobs or just entered the labour force to find jobs
- They may not take the first job they apply for, and may continue searching hoping to find a better job offer
- Employers may continue searching hoping to find a better-qualified candidate for the job
- The worker can take the first job right away, but this might not make the best use of his skills, resulting in lower productivity
- It is better for them tot take some time to find the right job, so that the economy's resources are more efficiently allocated and better utilised
### Imperfect information
- The unemployed are not fully informed of what jobs are available and what they entail; while employers are not fully informed on what labour is available
- Both workers and employers have to search, worker searching for the right job and employers searching for the right employment
- Frictional unemployment can be reduced by providing better job information so that the labour market is able to match people efficiently to jobs they like most/ best suited for
- The better the economy is doing, the lower the frictional unemployment as people are able to find jobs that suit them more quickly when the economy is doing well
### Incentive problem
- The unemployed may not want to be employed if the tax and benefit system will reduce the net increase in income from taking work
## Consequences
### Households
- Loss of income to the unemployed lower purchasing power and hence consumption of goods and services, lowering material standard of living
- Rising unemployment leads to potential loss of income sources, increasing levels of anxiety, lowering non-material standard of living
- When rising unemployment leads to high crime rates, peace of mind is diminished, lowering non-material standard of living
### Firms
- Lower consumption due to loss of income/ worsening consumer confidence will lead to lower production and sales of goods and services, lowering revenue
### Government
- Loss in tax revenue as the unemployed do not pay income tax, and spend less and pay lesser GST
- Running welfare offices incurs administrative costs, increasing government expenditure are unemployment benefits are given out
- With falling tax revenue and rising government expenditure, the budget balance worsens
- If the government budget was already in deficit, unemployment will result in rising budget deficit and rising government debt, since the government has to borrow more
### Economy
- Productive inefficiency in terms of wasted unused resources, and the economy is producing at a point inside the PPC
- This prevents society's welfare being maximised
- Rising unemployment reduces business confidence, causing firms to reduce investment as the expected rate of returns of investment is low
- As I is a part of AD, AD will fall, creating a downward multiplier effect on GDP
- The fall in investment slows down potential growth as capital stock is expanding more slowly, assuming growth rate of capital stock is more than the rate of capital depreciation
- High levels of unemployment creates other costs to society (e.g. due to strikes/ crimes/ begging, there is a fall in tourism and loss in business)
