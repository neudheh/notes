## Measures to influence the prices of goods/services
### Price Controls - Maximum price/ price ceiling
- ==A maximum price is the maximum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a particular good or service==
- This ensures basic goods are affordable and accessible to consumers
![[price ceiling.png]]
- For the maximum price regulation to be effective, the price must be set below the market equilibrium price
	- A maximum price that is set above or at the market equilibrium price would have no effect at all since the market equilibrium price is still attainable
- A price celling is used to control the price of essential goods and services, with the objective of making these goods more affordable
- At the maximum price, there is a shortage of goods or services in the market
	- The maximum price $P_{MAX}$ leads to a shortage of $Q_sQ_d$ units
- Without a price ceiling, a shortage would lead to upward pressure on price, causing prices to increase until equilibrium is restored
- Price plays a rationing function; those who are willing and able to pay a higher price will get the good/ service
- But the price ceiling create a persistent shortage, as such an alternative allocation system for goods and services is required 
- E.g. First-come-first-serve basis, rationing through coupons, seller's preference or random allocation
#### Welfare effects - Allocative efficiency
- From figure 3, assume that the initial equilibrium output $Q_E$ is allocative efficient
- A price celling of $P_{MAX}$ creates a shortage of $Q_sQ_D$ units
- The quantity sold falls from $Q_e$ to $Q_s$, and the quantity sold is now less than the socially optimal level at $Q_e$
- This fall in output by $Q_e - Q_s$ units causes a welfare loss equal to area $uew$
- For each of the $Q_e - Q_s$ units, there would have been a net welfare gain if those units were produce
- For the additional $Q_e - Q_s$ units, the increase in total social benefit (area under MSB curve) > increase in total social cost (area under MSC curve)
- The difference in area is the resulting welfare loss
#### Welfare effects - CS/ PS
- Initially, consumer surplus is represented by the area $aeP_E$ 
- With the maximum price, the new consumer surplus is represented by the area $auwP_{MAX}$
- Consumers who are able to obtain the good at the lower price benefit, but there are some consumers who are no longer able to obtain the good as quantity purchased fell from $Q_e$ to $Q_s$
- Hence, change in consumer surplus depends ton the relative sizes on the area $ued$ and area $P_eDwP_{MAX}$

- Initially, producer surplus is represented by the area $P_E0e$
- With the maximum price, the new producer surplus is represented by are $P_{MAX}w0$
- Hence, there is a fall in prouder surplus of are $P_EewP_{MAX}$
#### Discussion
- Relatively easy to implement when needed and effects are immediate -> Viable in the short term
- Relatively less costly -> No costs incurred other than monitoring and admin costs to check if firms are sticking to the maximum price
- Welfare loss -> Maximum price obscures price signals which normally guide the allocation of resources to the socially optimal level of output
- Creates a shortage of the produce -> Only some consumers will be able to enjoy the lower price of the goods, and consumers who are unable to get the good lose out
	- The shortage worsens in the long run, because supply become more price elastic over time, causing the shortage to increase from ($Q_E - Q_S$) to increase to ($Q_D - 0$)
- Emergence of black markets -> When there is not enough monitoring and enforcing by the govt, black markets are likely occur
	- Products are bought and the legal price and subsequently illegally sold at prices above the price ceiling
	- Consumers who seek goods in the black market would be willing to pay up to a maximum price of $P_{BM}$, undermining the objective of improved affordability of goods and services for the poor

### Price Controls - Minimum price/ Price floor
- ==A minimum price is the minimum permissible price producers may legally charge for a particular goods/ service==
- Governments do this to protect the incomes of low income producers, by raising producer revenue or by preventing their revenue from falling
- This increases their income level, reducing inequity
- Can be done 2 ways
	- By law (legislation)
	- By government guaranteeing to buy up a good at a stipulated price
![[price floor.png]]
- For a minimum price to be effective it must be set at a price above the market equilibrium price
	- A minimum price that is set below or at the market equilibrium price would have no effect at all since the market equilibrium price is still attainable
- The price floor will generate a persistent surplus
	- The minimum price policy raises market prices to $P_{MIN}$  
	- The quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$, while quantity supplied rises to $Q_S$ 
	- This creates a surplus of ($Q_S - Q_D$) units
- The government will incur an expenditure of $Q_DjmQ_S$ if it steps in the buy up and store the surplus
#### Welfare effects - by legislation
- The quantity demand falls to $Q_D$ units
- Consumer surplus is lowered form $aeP_E$ to $Aj_P{MIN}$
- Loss in Consumer surplus of $P_{MIN}jeP_E$

- Assuming perfect information, producers will reduce their quantity supplied to $Q_D$, as prodcuing anymore in $Q_D$ would result in a surplus
- This would require them to incur storage costs or wastage of the product
- The minimum price leads to a change in producer surplus form $beP_E$ to $bkjP_{MIN}$

- Comparing the sum of consumer and producer surplus before and after the minimum price, the welfare loss would be area $jek$

#### Welfare effects - by guaranteeing a minimum price and buying surplus
- The quantity supplied will increase to $Q_s$ units while quantity demanded falls to $Q_d$ units, creating a surplus at $P_{MIN}$, which the government has committed to buying up

- Consumer surplus decreases from $aeP_E$ to $ajP_{MIN}$
- Loss in Consumer surplus of $P_{MIN}jeP_E$

- Producer surplus increases from $beP_E$ to $bMP_{MIN}$
- Gain in producer surplus of $P_{MIN}meP_E$

- The sum of consumer and producer surplus increases by the amount $jme$
- However, this increase in CS and PS came at a cost to society in the form of the government incurring a spending of $Q_djmQ_s$ in order to buy up the surplus

- Subtracting the loss from the gain, the society has incurred a net welfare loss of the M-shaped area $Q_DjemQ_S$
#### Discussion
- Might enable the government to incur lowers costs compared to giving a subsidy to producers, especially when prices are exceptionally low
- Welfare loss -> Minimum price obscures price signals which normally guide the allocation of resources to the socially optimal level of output
	- There is also a wastage of society's scarce resources is increase if the surplus is disposed/ destroyed afterwards, especially for perishable goods
- Expensive for the government
	- if the government buys the the surplus, it incurs expenditure
	- It also incurs additional expenditure storing up the surplus
	- There is opportunity cost because expenditure on other areas may have to be reduced, leading to sacrifice of the net benefit from the next best alternative
	- The higher expenditure may be financed via higher taxes, which can be unpopular
	- The policy is fiscally unsustainable in the long run
### Production subsidy
- A production subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, but not made in exchange for any goods or services
- Given to producers of necessities to improve equity in distribution of these goods/ services by lowering prices of these goods and increasing the affordability of them
![[production subsidy equity.png]]
- Subsidy lowers the marginal cost of production as firms now receive a payment for each unit sold, causing the supply curve to shift to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$
- Consequently, consumers pay a lower price $P_2$ for each unit of the good as the equilibrium price falls from $P_1$ to $P_2$ and quantity rises from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- The subsidy per unit is the distance between $P_0$ and $P_2$ 
- The government spends area $P_0ecP_2$ on the subsidy
- The extent to which equilibrium price falls and equilibrium quantity increases depends on the price elasticity of demand
- When a good has price elastic demand, a fall in the price of the good will lead to a more than proportionate rise in quantity consumed
#### Welfare effects - Allocative efficiency
- The welfare effects of a subsidy depends on whiter the initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient
	- If it was allocative inefficient, it can increase output level to the allocative efficient level
	- But if it was already allocative efficient, with ill lead to welfare loss/ allocative inefficiency

- Assuming that initial equilibrium output $Q_1$ is allocative efficient 
- A production subsidy reduces the marginal cost of production, causing supply to increase to $S_2$
- This causes an increase in output of $Q_1Q_2$
- Since the subsidy increases production beyond the optimal of $Q_1$, there is now overproduction of the good, resulting in allocative inefficiency
- The welfare loss is given by area $bce$
- For the additional $Q_2 - Q_1$ units, the increase in total benefit (area under MSB curve) is less than the increase in total cost (Area under MSC curve)
- This results in a deadweight loss of area $bce$
#### Welfare effects - CS/ PS
- The production subsidy causes equilibrium price to fall form $P_1$ to $P_2$ and equilibrium quantity to rise from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- Consumer surplus rises by area $P_1bcP_2$
- Producer surplus rises by area by area $P_0 ebP_1$
- The governments total spending on the subsidy  = subsidy per unit X quantity sold = area $P_0ecP_2$
- The net welfare loss to society is given by area $P_1Bs_P2 + P_0ebP_1 - P_0ecP_2$ = area $bec$
#### Discussion
- Enchaining affordability of the goods and services for the poor, especially for essentials as they are price inelastic because they do not have a lot of close substitutes
	- A subsidy will cause a a significant fall in price, improving affordability
- Incurs government expenditure, and may not be fiscally sustainable where the government has a sustained budget deficit or a tight fiscal budget
	- There is opportunity cost because expenditure on other areas may have to be reduced, leading to sacrifice of the net benefit from the next best alternative
- Trade off between efficiency and equity, achieving equity might lead to allocative inefficiency
- Distortions in other markets, as funds for subsidizing a particular market could be due to the implementation of indirect taxes in another market
### Promote R&D to improve production process
- The prices of necessities can eb lowered if process innovation could take place, reducing the marginal cost of production increasing supply
- This would lead toa  fall in the market equilibrium price of the goods to $P_2$
![[R&D inequity.jpeg]]
- Government can incentives firms to engage in R&D by providing research grants
#### Discussion
- Allocative efficient -> successful R&D leads to a lowering of the equilibrium price of the good and rise in equilibrium quantity sold, where $Q_2$ is the new socially optimal level of output
- Addresses the root cause of rising price (either due to falling supply or continue rise in demand)
- R&D may not be successful
- Funding of R&D incurs an opportunity cost
	- There is opportunity cost because expenditure on other areas may have to be reduced, leading to sacrifice of the net benefit from the next best alternative
- Takes a long time to take effect
## Measures to influence income levels of low-income households
### Wage Controls - Minimum wage
- ==A minimum wage rate is the minimum hourly rate of pay for labour, enforced by law==
- To protect workers against unduly low pay, ensuing some basic standard of living and a more equitable share of the fruits of progress for all who are employed and need such protection
![[Minimum wage.jpeg]]
- This increases quantity supply of labour and a fall in quantity demand of of labour, causing unemployment as there is excess labour (surplus)
- But, it raises the wage rate for those who are still employed
#### Discussion
- Improves factor productivity -> Firms will be incentivised to raise productivity (e.g. through automation) to reduce their reliance on labour which has become more costly
	- Workers will also raise productivity to avoid unemployment
- Increased unemployment -> Creates a surplus of labour
- Ineffective -> Gives incentive for some workers to work below the minimum wage to stay employed, causing them to be illegally employed if there is no proper enforcement
### Income redistribution - Transfer payments
- ==A transfer payment is any expenditure by the government for which it receives no goods and services in return==
- Given in the form of direct cash payments, where income is transferred from one group of individuals (taxpayers), to other groups of individuals
- This can boost the purchasing power of consumers, increasing their ability to purchase goods and services, usually basic necessities
- Transfer payment are given out based on the criteria or profile of the receiver
- ==Vouchers are a form of in-kind transfers, which households can redeem for specific goods and services==
- Vouchers can be universal or targeted specifically at the poor to address inequity
- Vouchers ensure that the poor get what they need most, rather than have them squander the cash on vices such as gambling
- Vouchers, especially those with an expiry date, can increase the consumers ability to purchase goods in a particular market
- Vouchers thus improve equity in the market as lower income households have greater access to the goods/ services
- The consumption of certain goods such as education and healthcare and also improve the standard of living of lower income households
![[Vouchers inequity.jpeg]]
- As consumers have more purchasing power, and have a higher ability to purchase more/ better quality goods and services, the demand curve shifts to the right
#### Welfare effects
- If the initial equilibrium output was allocative inefficient, vouchers can increase output level to the allocative efficient level, improving allocative efficiency
- But if initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient, vouchers could lead to a welfare loss
- Vouchers with an expiration date may lead consumers to utilise the vouchers, even if they do not need to good or service  at that point

- Assuming the initial equilibrium output is allocative efficient
- Vouchers increase the consumer's ability to afford goods, increasing demand, reflected as a rightwards shift in demand to $D_1$
- This causes equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and output to rise to $Q_2$ 
- Since the new output $Q_2$ is larger than the socially optimal level of $Q_1$, the market is now allocative inefficient
- There is now overconsumption, resulting in a welfare loss of are $abc$
- For the additional $Q_2 - Q_1$ units, the increase in total benefit (area under MSB curve) is lesser than the increase in total cost (area under MSC curve)
- This results in a welfare loss of area $abc$
#### Discussion
- Effectiveness -> Can target specific groups, such as lower income households, while subsidies benefit all households, including higher income households who could already afford the good
- High costs -> Administrative costs to identify these lower income households, and some form of criterion needs to be developed, as well as distribution to these households
- Crutch mentality -> Reduces incentive to work, as recipients find it more worthwhile to continue receiving aid than take up a low paying job
### Income redistribution - Direct taxation
- ==Direct taxes are taxes levied by the government directly on the income, wealth and profits of individuals and firms==
- Include corporate tax, where firms are taxed a percentage of their profit; and income tax, where income earners are taxed a percentage of their income
- Taxes are a way to generate revenue, which would improve equity if used for redistributive policies
- ==A progressive tax is one that takes a larger percentage of income from high income earners than it does from low income earners==
- Progressive taxation helps to increase equity by reducing the post-tax income of the rich and increasing the income of the poor, when the tax revenue is redistributed in the form of transfer payments
- The government may implement progressive personal income tax, where the tax rate increases with income
- The rich will have to pay a higher proportion of their income in terms of their taxes compared to the poor
- The government can also raise certain direct taxes, such as the capital gains tax, which will affect the rich more
- This is because they earn most of the capital gains and dividends because they own most of the companies or assets
#### Discussion
- Stifles work incentives -> The marginal return to work effort is reduced
	- Labour might even relocate to countries with lower income taxes, causing productive capacity to decrease, and the PPC shifts in
	- May also result in productive inefficiency as workers hold back on the maximum productivity as any additional effort which bring potential wage increase may be taxed more heavily, resulting in unemployment
- Stifles investment incentives 0< Shifts economic production away from capital goods towards consumption goods
	- When higher income earners are faced with higher income tax rates on the interest they earn form saving, they are discouraged form saving, leading to a fall in the supply of loanable funds
	- This would lead to a rise in interest rate, leading to a fall in investment, impeding economic growth and standard of living in the long run
#### Wealth taxation
- Wealth taxes included taxes on capital gains, dividends and a net wealth tax on individuals
- But, wealth can be very mobile and move away very easily to other countries with more competitive tax rates
- Although they do not address equity directly, they generate revenue for the government for the government to spend on subsidies and redistributive policies
### Indirect taxation
- ==Indirect taxes are levied on the sale of goods and services==
- The producer or retailer has the legal responsibility to pay the text, but may be passed on to consumers
- Done to discourage consumption or raise tax revenue
- The government can use selective indirect taxation on goods and services  but cutting tax rates of good and services that are consumed more by the poor and raising taxes on luxury goods
![[indirect tax inequity.jpeg]]
- The tax causes the supply of the product to fall as the unit cost of production has risen
- The supply curve shifts left from $S_1$ to $S_2$, causing a shortage at the original price, causing upward pressure on prices until new equilibrium is reached
-  Equilibrium price rises form $P_1$ to $P_2$ and equilibrium output falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- As a result of the tax, consumers pay a higher price at $P_2$, while producers receive a lower price $P_0$ for each unit of the good (equilibrium price - tax per unit)
- The indirect tax is the distance between $S_1$ and $S_2$, and the tax revenue collected is Tax per unit X units sold = $P_2P_0 \times 0Q_2$ area $P_2cdP_0$
- The amount of tax revenue collected will be significant if demand for the goods is price inelastic, as there will be a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded when there is a rise in price
- The amount of tax revenue collected will be limited if the demand is price elastic, as there will be a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded when there is a rise in price
#### Welfare effects - Allocative efficiency
- Assume the initial equilibrium output $Q_!$ is allocative efifcnet
- An indirect tax is now imposed which adds to the marginal cost of production of firms, causing supply to fall and the supply curves shifts up to $S_2$ 
- Equilibrium price rises form $P_1$ to $P_2$ and equilibrium output falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- There is under consumption of ($Q_1 - Q_2$) 
- For the additional ($Q_1 - Q_2$) units, the increase in total benefit (area under MSB curve) is greater than the increase in social cost (area under MSC curve)
- This results in a net benefit to society of area $bcd$
#### Welfare effects - CS/ PS
- The consumer surplus falls falls by area $P_2cbP_1$  
- Producer surplus falls by area $P_1bdP_0$
- The government  tax revenue collected is Tax per unit X units sold = $P_2P_0 \times 0Q_2$ area $P_2cdP_0$
- Net welfare loss = $P_2cdP_0 - P_1bdP_0 - P_2cbP_1$ = area $cbd$
#### Discussion
- Enhancing affordability of goods and services for the poor -> Tax revenue collected can be channel towards to redistributive measures
- Flexible -> can adjust the types of goods and services target and their corresponding tax rates
- Makes goods/ services less affordable for the poor -> Indirect taxes are usually regressive, taxing equally both the rich and the poor
	- The poor spend a larger proportion of the income on consumption
	- An indirect tax drives up the price of goods, and makes them less accessible to the poor
### Skills upgrading
 - It improves the employability and potential productivity of workers, which improves income equality
- Education and skills training can enable lower income groups to escape the viscous cycle of inadequate education, poor training, low productivity and poor quality jobs with low wages
- With these upgraded skills, workers will be more likely to be able to enable industries with higher labour demand and command higher wages
- Skills upgrading results in increased productivity, which leads to a rise in demand for labour as workers are seen to be more valuable (as the contribute more to total revenue now)
- This increases the equilibrium wage rate without creating excess of supply of labour in the market
