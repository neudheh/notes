- ==Monetary policy is a process whereby the central bank of a country uses interest rates or exchange rates as alternative instruments to achieve the macroeconomic goals of the country==
## Interest rate monetary policy
- For interest rate centered monetary policy, the central bank changes the interest rate directly or indirectly by changing the money supply
- However, there is difficulty in controlling money supply, and the effects of monetary policy on the economy operate mainly via the interest rate
- Thus, central banks increasingly target interest rate rother than money supply as the monetary policy instrument
## Expansionary monetary policy
- ==Expansionary monetary policy is the lowering of interest rates or increasing of money supply to boost AD==
- This will influence consumption expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I)
- This can help to stimulate the economy and lower demand-deficient unemployment during a recession
### How does it work?
- With lower interest rates, the cost of borrowing falls and households are incentivized to purchase consumer durables (big ticket items e.g. cars and houses)
- Consumers will also lower returns on saving from a lower interest rate, thus lowering the opportunity cost of consumption
- Hence, C will rise
- There will also be a fall in the cost of borrowing, and firms will undertake new investments
- They will invest to the point where the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of returns, equal to the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- With a lower interest rate, some previously unprofitable units of investment might now become profitable
- Hence, I will rise

>- Assuming the economy is below full employment, the rise in C and I will cause AD to increase from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
>- This will cause an unplanned fall in inventories, and firms would increase production  by hiring more factors of production, increasing the factor income that they pay out
>- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
>- There is higher induced consumption
>- This leads to a another fall in inventories, and firms will further increase production and hire more FOPs, resulting in another cycle of spending
>- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
>- There is a multiplied increase in national income from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier process, assuming spare capacity in the economy
>- There will be actual economic growth shown by a rise in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
>- There is also a fall in demand-deficient unemployment as derived demand for labour also rises as firms increase output
## Contractionary monetary policy
- ==A contractionary monetary policy is where interest rates are raised or money supply is reduced to reduce AD==
