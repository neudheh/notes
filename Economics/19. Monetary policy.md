- ==Monetary policy is a process whereby the central bank of a country uses interest rates or exchange rates as alternative instruments to achieve the macroeconomic goals of the country==
## Interest rate monetary policy
- For interest rate centered monetary policy, the central bank changes the interest rate directly or indirectly by changing the money supply
- However, there is difficulty in controlling money supply, and the effects of monetary policy on the economy operate mainly via the interest rate
- Thus, central banks increasingly target interest rate rother than money supply as the monetary policy instrument
## Expansionary monetary policy
- ==Expansionary monetary policy is the lowering of interest rates or increasing of money supply to boost AD==
- This will influence consumption expenditure (C) and investment expenditure (I)
- This can help to stimulate the economy and lower demand-deficient unemployment during a recession
### How does it work?
- With lower interest rates, the cost of borrowing falls and households are incentivized to purchase consumer durables (big ticket items e.g. cars and houses)
- Consumers will also lower returns on saving from a lower interest rate, thus lowering the opportunity cost of consumption
- Hence, C will rise
- There will also be a fall in the cost of borrowing, and firms will undertake new investments
- They will invest to the point where the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of returns, equal to the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- With a lower interest rate, some previously unprofitable units of investment might now become profitable
- Hence, I will rise
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[expansionary fiscal policy.png]]
>- Assuming the economy is below full employment, the rise in C and I will cause AD to increase from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
>- This will cause an unplanned fall in inventories, and firms would increase production  by hiring more factors of production, increasing the factor income that they pay out
>- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
>- There is higher induced consumption
>- This leads to a another fall in inventories, and firms will further increase production and hire more FOPs, resulting in another cycle of spending
>- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
>- There is a multiplied increase in national income from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier process, assuming spare capacity in the economy
>- There will be actual economic growth shown by a rise in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
>- There is also a fall in demand-deficient unemployment as derived demand for labour also rises as firms increase output
## Contractionary monetary policy
- ==A contractionary monetary policy is where interest rates are raised or money supply is reduced to reduce AD==
- This is to help reduce inflationary pressures
### How does it work?
- With a higher inflation rate, the cost of borrowing rises
- The marginal cost of investment, the interest rate, is now greater than the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of returns
- This would cause some previously profitable units of investment to become unprofitable
- The cost of borrowing is also higher, and households would borrow lesser to purchase consumer durables
- The returns on savings is also higher, causing the opportunity cost of consumption to rise
- Hence, C and I fall, causing AD to fall
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand side deflation.png]]
>- By adopting a contractionary monetary policy, AD falls and the AD curve shifts form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
>- This will cause an unplanned rise in inventories, and firms would decrease production by hiring lesser factors of production, lowering the factor income that they pay out
>- Households will spend part of the income on consumption of domestic goods and services, and the remaining will go to savings, taxes and imports
>- There is lower induced consumption
>- This leads to a another rise in inventories, and firms will further decrease production and hire lesser FOPs, resulting in another cycle of spending
>- The process repeats itself until total withdrawals equal to total injections again and a new national income is achieved
>- There is a multiplied decrease in national income from $Y_0$ to $Y_2$ due to the reverse multiplier process, assuming spare capacity in the economy
>- There is a rise in unemployment, as seen by the output gap $Y_0 - Y_2$
>- This means that firms are better able to get the resources they need, and can have more efficient combinations of factors of production
>- Thus, there will be lesser inflationary pressure as the unit cost of production fell, and GPL fall is the economy was near or at full employment previously

### Impact on BOP
**BOT/ current account**
- With a higher interest rate, the higher borrowing costs would result in lower C and I, causing AD to fall
- If the fall in AD lowers national income, the fall in national income will induce a reduction in the expenditure on imports and improve BOT
- The fall in AD can also lower the GPL, making exports more price competitive
- This will lead to a rise in quantity demanded for exports and a rise in total export revenue if the demand for exports is price elastic
- Domestic goods and services also become cheaper than imports, leading to a fall in demand for imports and a reduction in import expenditure
- Hence, there is an improvement in the BOT
**Capital and financial account**
- The rise in the interest rate would lead to hot money inflows due to the higher rates of returns for investment, improving the capital and financial account
## Evaluation of interest rate monetary policy
### Interest rate sensitivity of consumption and investment expenditure
- During a recession, investment demand may not be as sensitive to a fall in interest rates
- Firms are unlikely to borrow if they are already facing excess capacity, and when the expected rate of return is low due to poor business outlook
- If demand for investment is interest rate inelastic, a fall in the interest rate would lead to a less than proportionate rise in investments
- Consumptions is also likely to be interest rate inelastic in times of recession, due to low incomes and poor economic outlook
- Thus, C and I are not responsive to interest rate cuts due to poor economic outlook, making monetary policy ineffective
### Size of multiplier
- A country with a high $MPC_d$ or low $MPW$ would have a larger multiplier, and monetary policy would be effective in raising output and employment
- This is because there would be a large multiplied increase in real GDP
### Size of domestic sector
- The size of the domestic market out of GDP affects the extent of impact of interest rate policy
- If the domestic consumption and investment expenditure are small relative to the export revenue, interest rate policy at increasing these components may not have a large impact
- If Singapore uses expansionary interest rate monetary policy to increase national income, the extent of the rise in AD may not be significant
### Liquidity trap
- This is a situation which occurs when the interest rate in the country has reached its lowest possible level and cannot fall any further
- Japan has a close to 0% interest rate for years, yet consumers are not willing to spend and firms are unwilling to invest
### Exchange rate system
- Under a managed float exchange rate system, the central bank loses control of its money supply, and cannot use interest rates to influence aggregate demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The central bank may raise interest rates to deal with demand pull inflation
>- This however, attracts hot money inflows, leading to a rise in demand for the currency in the forex market
>- This causes an upward pressure on the exchange rate
>- To prevent the currency from appreciating above the upper limit in a managed float exchange rate system, the bank needs to sell domestic currency in the forex market
>- Once the money ends up in the bank accounts in the local banking system, money supply will increase
>- This will lower interest rates, negating the effects of the original intended contractionary monetary policy

- However, under a floating exchange rate system, monetary policy can further help the economy to recover through adjustments in external demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Lowering interest rates would lead to hot money outflows, increasing supply of the currency in the forex market
>- This would put downward pressure on the exchange rate, causing the currency to depreciate
>- This will decrease the prices of exports in foreign currencies and increase the price of imports in domestic currency
>- Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, net exports will rise, increasing AD, and leading to real GDP growth
>- Conversely, increasing interest rates will lead to hot money inflows, increasing demand for the currency
>- This will put upward pressure on the exchange rate, causing the currency to appreciate
>- The currency appreciation will further dampen export demand and encourage imports, decreasing AD, and adding downward pressure on the GPL

## Exchange rate monetary policy
- ==Foreign exchange rate policy is a policy centered on management of the exchange rate==
- Central banks which have adopted a managed float exchange rate system can have a policy with regards to its exchange rate
## Exchange rate depreciation
- ==It refers to a downward revision of the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies==
- This is done by the central bank selling the local currency in a managed float exchange rate system
- This aims to switch expenditure away from foreign goods to domestically produced goods by making exports cheaper in terms of foreign currency and imports more expensive in terms of local currency
- This can help boost economic growth and reduce unemployment
### How does it work?
- When the central bank allows the local currency to depreciate, foreigners would find exports to be cheaper and this would lead to a rise in exports
- Domestic consumers will switch from buying imports to the relatively cheaper domestically produced goods and services as imports are more expensive
- Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, this would cause net export revenue to rise (X-M), leading to a rise in AD
- Moreover, depreciation of the currency may attract short term capital inflows to buy financial assets as they are now relatively cheaper for foreigners
- There would be an increase in the supply of loanable funds which would put downward pressure on the interest rate
- Depreciation may also attract FDI as assets are cheaper, making investment more profitable
- This would increase I, adding to the expansionary effect on AD, leading to actual growth
*Shifts in AD would be elaborated on as per above*
### Limitations
**Imported inflation**
- Depreciation may cause the price of imported inputs to rise, causing firms to see a rise in the unit cost of production
- This may lead to a fall in AS, causing the horizontal portion of AS to shift upwards
- This can decrease real GDP and lead to imported inflation
- This will then lead to a rise in unemployment
- Moreover, imported inflation may reduce the attractiveness for FDI and discourage long term capital inflows
**Capital flight**
- If deprecation is seen as a sign that the central bank cannot support the forex rate, the expectation of further deprecation may cause investors to withdraw their funds
- This would lead to a rise in short term capital outflows
- The fall in the supply of loanable funds would increase the interest rate, lowering investment
- This would cause AD to fall, leading to a fall in actual growth, and a rise in unemployment
### Effects on BOP
**BOT/ Current account**
- Deprecation makes exports cheaper in foreign currency and imports more expensive in local currency
- Foreigners would demand more exports, leading to a rise in export revenue
- If the demand for imports is price elastic, the more the proportionate decrease in quantity demand for imports will lead to a fall in import expenditure
- Assuming the Marshall-Lerner conditions holds, there would be an improvement in the BOT and hence the current account
**Capital account**
- Depreciation makes a countries assets cheaper in foreign currencies, leading to short term capital inflows
- The depreciation makes these assets cheaper, resulting in higher returns
- But, if further depreciation is expected, short term capital inflow may not be encouraged and there may be capital outflow due to speculation
- The value of the returns may be lower in the future in foreign currency
- Depreciation may also attract long term capital inflows like FDI
- But, the impact is uncertain as the stability of the exchange rate is a critical factor for FDI
- If the exchange rate continues to depreciate, the profit earned by the firm will be lower when the convert it back to their home currency
- If the country is dependent on imported inputs, the rise in unit cost of production could also reduce the attractiveness of FDI
## Exchange rate appreciation
- ==Exchange rate appreciation is the upward revision of the country's currency in terms of foreign currency==
- This is done by the central bank buying up domestic currency in the forex market
- This is done yo make exports more expensive in term so foreign currency, and make imports cheaper in terms of local currency, to switch expenditure from domestically produced goods to foreign goods
- This can help to lower inflation
### How does it work?
- An exchange rate appreciation would make exports more expensive in foreign currency and lead to a fall in demand for exports
- It also makes imports cheaper, leading to a rise in quantity demanded for imports
- Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, this leads to a fall in net export revenue (X-M), lowering AD
*See above for fall in AD leading to deflation explanation*
- Exchange rate appreciation will also lower cost-push inflation in the country due to imported inflation
- This is because the price of imported inputs in terms of local currency would fall, leading to a lower unit cost of production
- This would thus lower the GPL, reducing imported inflation
## Evaluation of exchange rate policies
### PED of exports and imports
- To improve the trade balance, the central bank wants to depreciate the exchange rate
- However, this is assuming the Marshall-Lerner conditions holds, where $|PED_X + PED_M| > 1$
- If the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold, depreciation would cause (X-M) to fall instead of rise, worsening the balance of trade and negatively affecting growth
- This may be true in the short term, due to imperfect information and the fixed nature of exports and imports contracts
- Foreign markets need time to realize that exports are cheaper and change their spending habits, and locals need time to realize that import prices are higher
- Firms are also contractually bound to continue with existing suppliers for a certain time period before switching to a cheaper one
### Spare capacity in economy
- Depreciation results in actual growth and rise in employment only if there is spare capacity
- The central bank may adopt depreciation of its currency to improve BOT, and it would lead to a rise in AD 
- But, if there is a lack of spare capacity in the economy, demand-pull inflation will result, offsetting the advantage on price created by depreciation
### Nature of the economy
- For a small and open economy like Singapore, depreciation will not be effective in improving a trade deficit
- This is because with depreciation, exports become cheaper in terms of foreign currencies, but the cost of imported inputs rises
- This leads to a rise in unit cost of production, which partially erodes the improved price competitiveness of the exports
- Imported goods would also cost more, adding to inflationary pressures in the economy
- If workers and trade unions press for higher wages due to rise rising cost of living, it will result in a wage-price level
- This will result in cost-push inflation, reducing the improved competitiveness of exports, and import substitution effect that was intended by the depreciation
### Causes and mix of macroeconomic problems
- Depreciation may not address the root causes of the economic problems
- For example, if the BOT deficit is due to the poor quality of a country's exports,  then supply side policies which can improve the quality of exports would be more appropriate
- The mix of macroeconomic problems present is also an important factor to consider
- If a country has both a BOT deficit and demand-deficient unemployment, then exchange rate depreciation may be appropriate, as it improves BOT and increases AD
- But, if the country has both a BOT deficit and inflation, exchange rate depreciation mat not be appropriate as it worsens inflation
### Retaliation by other countries
- When a country depreciates, its trading partners may suffer a fall in their export revenue and face stiff competition form cheaper imports
- They may retaliate by depreciating their currencies, which would offset the intended improvement in export price competitiveness
- Demand for exports may not increase by much, and a currency war may result
