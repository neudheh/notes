- Government failure occurs when government intervention fails to improve outcomes, and makes them worse
- The final outcome must be worse, and there is no overall improvement
## Conflicting goals between equity and efficiency
- It is possible int he pursuit of productive efficiency (by making output reach he level where MSB = MSC), the government might worsen equity

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Schools canteen vendors are required to include fruits as a side dish to encourage healthy eating, to solve underconsumption of healthy foods
>- This translates into higher costs for conteen vendors who ,ight pass the higher costs onto consumers through higher prices
>- Could result in equity if poorer students are unable to afford the more expensive canteen meals sold

- Likewise, in an attempt to improve equity, governments may impose a price floor or price ceiling on essentials
- But, these measures prevent the price mechanism from playing its signalling role, which is required for the market to achieve allocative efficiency
- When the government distorts the prices of goods, price no longer reflect their true opportunity costs
- Price floors encourage over-production and wasteful surpluses
- Price ceiling can result in smuggling to sell the goods in overseas markets instead
- Both result in severe resource allocation
## Imperfect information leading to over-correction
- For a negative externality like pollution, it is difficult to accurately measure the external costs borne by third parties and to trace the source of pollution
- The government might end up overcorrecting the market, such as imposing a tax that is too high, shifting the MPC by too much, causing a bigger welfare loss
- In a bid to tackle road congestion, a government might impose a ban on all vehicles entering the city on certain days to the week
- However, this might result in greater welfare loss compared to the case where congestion is left uncorrected
## Unintended consequences
- Government intervention through various policies may give rise to unintended consequences
- These may add so much to the costs of the policies that as a society, overall welfare does not improve but worsens
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- A smoking ban in public places may result in more frequent smoking at home
>- Young children at home may be subject tot higher levels of passive smoke, and this may lead to higher welfare loss to society

## Time lags
### Lags in data and recognition
- It takes time for authorities to recognise a problem in the economy
- Economic statistics such as prices are only available with a considerable lag
- Many economic indicators (e.g. unemployment rate) tend to be backward looking, meaning they only tell you what has already happened instead of what is happening right now
- The government may not have information until months after, during which the economy have already changed course
### Lags in implementation
- Due to bureaucracy and red tape in large government organisations, long periods of time may be needed for policies to pass through the parliament process to be approved
### Lags in impact
- This lag is any change initiated by a government policy takes to implement the producers and consumers in the economy
- Policies need time to be implemented and to take effect
- A policy designed to remove one problem may only finally take effect when the economy is suffering from an opposite problem
## Lack of profit motive
- Market forces are important, as it creates incentives for producers to innovate, compete and sue the least-cost methods of production
- Government can intervene to address allocative inefficiency caused by the presence of market power is through nationalisation
- Nationalisation is when ownership and control of a firm is transferred from private hands to the state
- The government is not profit-motivated, and do not have an incentive to make the most out of the spend (unlikely to choose the least cost means to solve a problem)
- They also tend to be less innovate, offering limited product choices possibly of poor quality
- Also can apply to direct provision
- This can lead to productive inefficiency
## Policy myopia
- Politicians have a tendency to look for short term solutions of quick fixes to solve difficult economic problems to gain political favours, as a government is only elected for 5 years
- The government will use measures that only show results within this time frame, rather than taking a long-term perspective in solving the problems
- But, this will only provide short term relief to problems, rather than address structural problems
- E.g. a decision to build more roads might simply add to the problems of traffic congestion in the long run

>[!TLDR]
>- The government should intervene only when the benefits of intervention exceeds the costs of intervention
>- Using an inappropriate method of intervention might be the source of government faliure
>- Government intervention may result in government failure, for several reasons such as the conflict of objectives, lack of info, and time lag
>- The government might look like it has failed, but it could be the result of the government prioritizing equity over efficiency
