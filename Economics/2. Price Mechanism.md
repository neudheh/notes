## Free market economy
- The government is not involved in resource allocation
- Households and firms are free to pursue their self-interest (Households aim to maximise net benefit while firms seek to maximise total profits)
- Households have freedom of choice about what to consume and how much to consume
- There is enterprise and competition
- All productions is undertaken by firms and they make decisions about what to produce, how much to produce
- Profit-motivated firms will produce these goods to meet the preferences of the consumers only if it is profitable
- Consumers and firms make their consumption and production decisions independently of each other
- There is no one person or authority that is planning or driving the economy, yet the economy moves towards producing certain goods in certain quantities
- This is achieved via the operation of the price mechanism helping consumers and firms come to a consensus on price and quantity of goods and services
- The price mechanism, through its signalling and rationing functions coordinates the independent of consumers and producers in the allocation of scarce resources in a free market economy
- It determines what and how much to produce, how to produce, and for whom to produce
- It also provides incentives for producers to allocate scarce resources
## Demand
- ==Demand for a good/ service refers to the quantity of a good/ service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices, in a given time period==
### Law of demand
- ==The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between quantity demanded and price, ceteris paribus==
- When making consumption decisions, consumer consider the perceived satisfaction they derive from consuming the good or service, which is referred to as utility
- Total utility is the total satisfaction a person derives from consuming a given amount of a good per period of time
- It is derived from adding up the marginal utilities of consumption of various units of goods
- ==Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction derived from consuming the additional unit of the good per period of time==
- ==The law of diminishing marginal utility states that beyond a certain level of consumption, as more and more units of a good/ service are consumed, the additional utility a consumer derives from successive units decreases==
- Assuming that the unit of measurement is constant, and ceteris paribus
- Consumers will aim to maximise net total utility
- Applying the marginalist principle, a rational consumer is willing to purchase additional units of the good so as long as the marginal benefits exceeds the marginal cost
- He will keep buying an additional unit of the good until his marginal utility is equal to price
- If P < MU, consumers will derive greater net benefits from buying additional units of the good since the addition to total benefit exceeds the addition to total cost
- If P > MU, it is rational for consumers to cut back on the consumption of the good since reducing the amount consumed will lower total benefits by less than total cost, increasing net total benefits
- The MU thus reflect the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for an additional unit of a good
- Since MU is falling with increased units of a good, the price that consumers are willing to pay is also falling
- This is why the demand curve is downward sloping
### Demand schedule
- An individual demand schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demand of a consumer, ceteris paribus
- A market demand schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus, for all consumers
- The market demand schedule is the sum of all of the quantity demanded by each consumer at each price level
- The demand schedule can be transformed graphically into a demand curve by plotting price on the vertical axis and horizontal axis
- The market demand curve is obtained form summing up horizontally the individual curves of all the consumers in the market
- It shows the inverse relationship between price and the quantity demanded of all consumers, ceteris paribus
- Economists are usually more concerned with market demand rather than individual demand
- Demand is a flow concept, as it is analysed over a period of time
### Movements vs. shifts in the demand curve
- If the price falls, the quantity demanded falls, and this is reflected by a downward movement along the demand curve
- Movements in the demand curve are cause by price only, and is a change in quantity demanded
- A rise in quantity demanded at all price points (i.e. a rise in demand), causes the demand curve to shift rightwards, and vice versa
- Shifts in the demand curve are cause by some factors other than the price of the good itself, and is called a change in demand
## Factors shifting the demand curve
### Changes in level of income
- As peoples incomes rises, their purchasing power increases and this causes demand for normal goods to rise
- For inferior goods, as peoples income rises, demand for interior goods falls
- Inferior goods include low-grade non fragrant white rice, second-hand goods, or generic products
### Changes in price or availability of related goods
#### Price
- Substitute goods are goods that are in competitive demand (i.e. they satisfy the same needs and may replace each other in use)
- If two goods, X and Y, are substitutes, a fall in the price of good X will cause a rise in quantity demanded of X as consumers to switch away from Y to purchase the relatively cheaper X, leading to in fall in demand for good Y
- Complementary goods are goods that are in joint demand, as they are consumed together to satisfy a specific need
- A fall in a price of a complementary good will increase its quantity demanded, and hence the demand for a good in joint demand will increase in as well
#### Availability
- An increase in the availability of substitute goods will lead to a decrease in demand for a good
- An increase in the availability of complementary goods will lead to an increase in the demand for the good that is in joint demand
#### Changes in demand for related goods
- There is also derived demand, where the goods is not demanded for its own sake, but usually used in the production process of another good
- For example, the demand for nurses is a derived demand from the demand of healthcare
- The demand for factors of production is derived from the demand for other goods
### Expectations of future price changes
- If people expect the prices of a good to rise significantly in the near future, they are likely to buy more now before the price increase sets in, therefore current demand for the good increases
- This can depend if a good can be stored, if it is perishable, and goods which can people can bring forward for purchase
### Changes in taste/ preference
- The more desirable people find a good, which means the more they are willing to pay for the goods, ceteris paribus, the more if it they will demand at any given price
- Changing  tastes are affected by a variety of influences including changes in advertising, fashion, new information through hearsay or the press
### Changes in government policies
*Mostly outright bans*
- Government policies, in the form of legislation, may change the demand for specific goods and services
- Restrictions, partials bans
- Legislation such as anti-smoke laws can reduce the demand for cigarettes
- Can also be positive
- The development of cycling paths causes the island to be more connected and safer to cycle, causing more people to cycle, increasing the demand for bikes
- This cannot be a factor in the free market theoretically, but most if not all economies are mixed economies in reality rather than completely free from government intervention
#### Changes in interest rate or availability of credit
*Only applicable for large purchases people have to take up loans for such as cars and houses*
#### Interest rate
- Interest rate refers to the cost of borrowing money from banks
- When the interest rate is reduced, loans are now cheaper
- Consumers are  are more likely to borrow money to finance purchases of consumer durables ( cars/ houses)
- This is because the cost of purchase in terms of monthly payments has fallen even though the prices of these goods remain unchanged
- This increases the ability of consumers who borrowed the money to buy the goods
#### Availability of credit
- During an economic downturn, the economy may not be doing well and banks, being concerned over the higher risk of default, may stop or slow down lending of funds to businesses or individuals
- The inability by households to obtain loans to buy big-ticket times such as cars or properties will lead to a decrease in demand for such goods
- When the economy is doing well, there may be easy credit where loans are easily obtained from banks, and consumers are incentivised to borrow to purchase big ticket items, leading to an increase in demand for those goods
### Changes in population structure
- Changes in the demography refers to changes in the population size/ structure
- A rise in the general population will lead to an increase in demand for most goods and services, assuming that purchasing power per head does not decrease as a result of the population increase
- If the population structure were to change e.g. Ageing population, there will be a larger population of elderly and a smaller proportion of the young, the demand for goods and services consumed by the elderly (e.g. healthcare, medical aids) will increase, while that consumed by the youth will decrease

## Supply
- ==Supply is the willingness and ability of a firm to offer a good for sale at various prices in a given time period==
### Law of supply
- ==The law of supply states that there is a direct or positive relationship between price and quantity supplied==
### Supply schedule
- The supply schedule is the quantity that producers are willing and able to supply at various prices
- Similar to demand schedule
- The supply schedule can also be represented graphically as a supply curve
- The markets supply schedule is the quantity supplied at each price point of all producers
- The market supply curves is the horizontal summation of all the individual firms supply curves
### Movements vs shifts in the supply curve
- If the price rises, the quantity supplied rises, and this is reflected by a movement along the supply curve
- If a non-price faster changes, it would be a change in quantities supplied at every price point (i.e. a change in supply), and this is reflected by the supply curve shifting
- An increase in supply causes the supply curve to shift right, and vice versa
## Factors affecting the supply curve
### Changes in the marginal cost of production
- An increase in the marginal cost of production will reduce supply and cause a leftward shift in the supply curve
- This is because the marginal cost of production lowers total profits for the firm, and the firm will be less willing to supply the good at every price level and supply of the good falls
#### Change in price of factor inputs
- The price of factor inputs will determine the production costs and hence profits earned
- If wages, raw material prices or utility prices were to rise, the marginal cost of production will rise, and every extra unit of output will now cost more than before
#### Change in technology that improves production processes
- Technological advanced that enable production process to be more productive will reduce marginal costs of production and increase profits to be earned at any given price
- Advances in computer technology have caused many production processes to become more automated and efficient with lesser need for labour, lowering marginal cost of production
#### Change in government policy
- Government policies in the form of taxes, subsidies and government regulation can affect the marginal cost of production, and in turn supply
- A fall in the foreign labour quota (amount of foreign labour that can be employed by the firms) would force firms to hire more local workers which command higher wages, raising marginal costs of production
- An increase in indirect tax on a good increases marginal costs of production will cause supply of the good to fall
- A specific subsidy given to producers offsets the marginal cost of production and reduce the price producers require for producing any given amount of a good
### Changes in production of related good
#### Production of related goods
- Sometimes, when one good is produced, another good is also being produced at the same time
- These goods are said to be goods in joint supply
- When theres is a rise in supply of petrol because of a decrease in its marginal cost of production, then the supply of other fuels will rise
- Other goods are in competitive supply and require similar factors of productions
- If there is a rise in supply of apples because of a decrease of its marginal cost of production, then the supply of oranges falls as farmers are devoting more land for apple production, and lesser for orange production
#### Price of related goods
- When the price of beef rises, the quantity supplied of beef will rise, this would lead to the supply of goods in joint supply such as leather to rise as farmers rear more cows now
- Conversely, with the rise in price of beef, the quantity supplied of beef will rise, more farmers are incentivised to switch production away from goods in competitive supply such as chicken to beef, leading to a fall in the supply of chicken
### Changes in expectations of future price changes
- If a price of a good is likely expected to rise, producers may tempoarily hold back the amount they sell currently
- They are likely to build up their stocks in order to sell them at a higher price in the future to enjoy a higher profit margin
- Thus, current supply of the good falls
- This only applies if the good can be stored and is non perishable
### Nature, random shocks and other unpredictable events
- Adverse weather conditions such as floods and droughts can greatly reduce agricultural output as the destruction of crops due to the weather would lead to a fall in supply
- Wars and natural disasters such as earthquakes can kill many people and destroy buildings and machinery
- Events such as an industrial strikes and banking crisis can disrupt production and reduce producers ability to supply
### Changes in number of sellers or firms
- The market supply is made up the supply of individual firms
- In the long run, if more firms enter the market, the market supply will rise
- In Singapore, the demand for mobility aids such as wheelchairs is rising, causing an increase in price of the goods, and existing firms in the short run react by increasing quantity supplied (Movement along supply curve)
- In the long run, new firms that are attracted by the increased profitability of selling this good will enter the industry
- If more firms enter the market, the market supply will rise

## Interaction of demand and supply
- The equilibrium price/ quantity of a good / service is determined by the intersection of the market demand/ supply curves
- ==Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the price that consumers are willing and able to pay for the good/ service and the market price they actually pay==
- ==Producer surplus refers to the difference between what producers are willing and able to supply the unit of good for and the price they actually receive==
- Total consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the market price, while total producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the market surplus
- They are a measure of consumer/ producers welfare
