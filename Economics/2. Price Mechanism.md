## Free market economy
- In a free market economy, the government is not involved in resource allocation
- Households and firms are free to pursue their self-interest
- Households aim to maximise their net benefits while firms aim to maximise their total profits
- Households have the freedom of choice to make decision about that the consume and how much to consume
- All factors of production are owned by households and they can decided how much and to whom they wish to supply
- All production is undertaken by firms and they decided what to produce, how much to produce and how to produce
- Firms are profit-motivated and will produce goods to meet the preferences of the consumers only if it is profitable
- Consumers and firms make their consumption and production decision independently of each other
- There is no one person or authority such as the government that is planning and directing the economy
- Yet, the economy moves towards prodcuing certain goods in certain quantities
- This is through the price mechanics, the coordinating mechanism by which the decisions of consumers and producers result in the allocation of scarce resources in a free market economy
- It answers the tree basic economic questions:
	- What and how much to produce?
	- How to produce?
	- For whom to produce?
- It does so through its signalling, incentive and rationing functions 
## Demand
- ==Demand for a goods or service refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and bale to buy at various prices, in a given time period==
- ==The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price of the good and quantity demanded of the good, ceteris paribus==
- When the price of a good falls, the quantity demanded will rise and vice versa

>[!NOTE]- Why is there an inverse relationship between demand and price of the good?
>- When making consumption decisions, consumers aim to maximise their utility
>- Total utility is the total satisfaction a person derives from consuming a given amount of a good per period of time
>- It is derived from adding up the marginal utilities of consumption of various units of goods
>- ==Marginal utility is the additional satisfaction derived from consuming the additional unit of the good per period of time==
>- ==The law of diminishing marginal utility states that beyond a certain level of consumption, as more and more units of a good/ service are consumed, the additional utility a consumer derives from successive units decreases==
>- Assuming that the unit of measurement is constant, and ceteris paribus
>- Consumers will aim to maximise net total utility
>- Applying the marginalist principle, a rational consumer is willing to purchase additional units of the good so as long as the marginal benefits exceeds the marginal cost
>- He will keep buying an additional unit of the good until his marginal utility is equal to price
>- If P < MU, consumers will derive greater net benefits from buying additional units of the good since the addition to total benefit exceeds the addition to total cost
>- If P > MU, it is rational for consumers to cut back on the consumption of the good since reducing the amount consumed will lower total benefits by less than total cost, increasing net total benefits
>- The MU thus reflect the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for an additional unit of a good
>- Since MU is falling with increased units of a good, the price that consumers are willing to pay is also falling
>- This is why the demand curve is downward sloping
### Demand schedule
- An individual demand schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded of one consumer
- A market demand schedule shows the relationship between the price and quantity demanded of all consumers
- The market demand schedule is the sum of all of all the quantity demanded by each consumer at each price level
### Demand curve
- The demand schedule can be transformed graphically into a demand curve by plotting price on the vertical axis and quantity demanded on the horizontal axis 
- The market demand curve is the horizontal summation of the individual demand curves of all the consumers on the market
- Economists are more concerned with market demand rather than individual demand because firms sell to more than one consumer
- The term demand curve is used even when the graph is a straight line, because economists use straight lines instead to simplify the analysis
- Demand is analysed over a period to time, hence it is a flow concept
### Movement VS shifts in the demand curve
- A change in the price of the good itself results in a change in the quantity demanded, illustrated by a movement along the demand curve 
- A shift in the demand curve is due to factors other than price of the goods itself, is due to a change in demand
- A rise in demand causes the curve to shift to the right, while a fall in demand causes the curve to shift to the left
## Factors shifting the demand curve
### Change in the level of income
- As people's income rises, their ability to buy goods increases and this would cause demand for most goods to rise
- Such goods are called normal goods
- There are two kinds of normal goods, necessity and luxury goods
- When people are more affluent, their purchasing power increases and the demand for normal goods such as smartphones increases
- However, inferior goods such as second hand clothes will see a fall in demand as income rises
- More in [[3. Elasticity|elasticity]]
### Change in the price or availability of related goods
- Substitutes goods are goods that are in competitive demand
- They can satisfy the same needs and may replace each other in use (e.g. iPhone VS Samsung Galaxy)
- If two goods are substitutes, the fall in the price of the substitute good X would increase quantity demanded of good X
- Consumers would switch away from good Y to purchase the relatively cheaper X, leading to a fall in demand for Y
- An increase in the availability of substitutes would lead to a decrease in demand for a good

- Complementary goods are goods that are in joint demand
- They are consumed together (e.g. bread and butter)
- If two goods are complementary goods, a fall in the price of complementary good X would increase quantity demanded of good X
- Hence, demand for the good in joint demand would increase as well
- An increase in the availability of complementary goods would lead to an increase in the demand for the goods

- Derived demand is when the good is demanded not for its on sake, but to be used in the production of another good
- The demand for factors of production is derived from the demand for other goods
- For example, an increase in the demand for healthcare would lead to an increase int he demand for nurses
### Expectations of future price changes
- If people expect the price of a goods to rise significantly in the near future, they will buy more now before the price increase sets in, therefore current demand of the good will rise
- The extent of such behaviour depends on whether the good can be stored or if it is perishable
- It is especially applicable to speculative assets (can be resold for profits - e.g. gold, houses), and also goods people can bring forward to purchase (e.g. cars, houses)
### Changes in tastes/ preferences
- The more desirable people find a good, the more willing they are to pay for the good
- Ceteris paribus, they will demand more at every given price
- Affected by a variety of influences, including changes in advertising, fashion, new information through hearsay or the press
### Changes in government policies
- Government policies, in the form of legislation may change the demand for specific goods and services
- E.g. legislation such as anti-smoking laws can reduce the demand for cigarettes
- Only applies to bans, or restrictions
- Theoretically this cannot be a factor in the free market
- However, most if not all economies are mixed economies in reality rather than completely free from government intervention
### Changes in interest rate or availability of credit
- This only applies for large purchase that people take up loans for such as cars or houses
- Interest rate refers to the cost of borrowing money from banks
- When interest rate is reduced, loans are now cheaper, and consumers are more likely to borrow money to finance purchases of big-ticket items (cars, houses)
- The cost of purchase has fallen even though the prices of these goods remain unchanged, increasing the ability of consumers who borrowed the money to buy the goods

- During an economic downturn, the economy may not being so well
- Banks, being concerned over the higher risk of default may stop or slow lending of funds to businesses or individuals
- The inability of households to get loans to buy big-ticket items such as cars or properties would lead to a decrease in demand for such goods
- When the economy is doing well, there may be easy credit where loans are easily obtained from banks, and consumers are incentivised to borrow to purchase big ticket times, resulting in an increase in demand
### Changes in the population structure
- A rise in the general population will lead to an increase in demand for most goods and services, assuming purchasing power per head does not decline as a result of the population increase
- If population structure were to change, such as an ageing population, there will be a larger proportion of the elderly and a smaller proportion of the young
- The demand for goods and services consumed by the elderly (healthcare, medical aids) will increase while demands for goods consumed by the youth will decrease

## Supply
- ==Supply is the willingness and ability of a firm to offer a good for sale at various prices in a  given time period==
- ==The law of supply states that there is a direct/ positive relationship between price and quantity supplied==
>[!NOTE]- Why is there positive relationship between supply and price of the good
>- Firms aim to maximize total profits (i.e. total revenue - total cost
>- According to the marginalist principle, profit maximizing firms will produce additional units of goods as long as the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost
>- The Marginal benefit is the marginal revenue (MR)
>- The marginal revenue is the additional revenue the firms earns from selling an additional unit of the good
>- In a perfectly competitive market, the marginal cost of prodcuing an additional unit of the goods is the marginal cost (MC)
>- Producers will produce up till MR = MC
>- The law of diminishing marginal returns affects the MC and hence the shape of the supply curve
>- MC tends to rise as output rises
>- In order to produce more units of the goods, a firm will have to hire more workers
>- If the amount of capital is fixed, adding more workers will cause more workers to have lesser capital to work with
>- Eventually, the additional output contributed by each additional worker falls and hence the addition to total cost (MC) is with each increasing unit of output rises
>- In order to cover the additional MC, firms are able to offer more units of output for sale only if the price of the good rises
>- As price of the good (MR) rises, MR > MC if producers continue to produce at the same output level
>- This causes firms to increase output as total profits will be rising
### Supply schedule
- Similar to a demand schedule, the quantity that producers are willing and bale to produce at various prices can be shown in a supply schedule
### Supply curve
- The supply schedule can also be represented as a supply curve
- The market supply schedule is the horizontal summation of all the individual firms supply curves
### Movement VS shifts in the supply curve
- If price rises, the quality supplied increases and this is reflected by an upwards movement along the supply curve
- A shift in the supply curve due to a change in some factors other than the price, is referred to as a change in supply
- When supply increases, the supply curve shifts to the right, and when supply decreases, the supply curve shifts to the left
## Factors affecting the supply curve
### Increase in the marginal cost of production
- An increase in the marginal cost of production will reduce supply and cause a leftward shift in the supply curve
- When the marginal cost of production increases, profits are lowered and firms would be less wiling to supply the good at every price point, causing supply to fall
#### Change in the prices of factor inputs
- Price of factor inputs will determine the production costs adn hence profits earned
- If the prices of factor inputs were to rise, the marginal cost of production will rise
- Every unit of output will now cost more than before
- Firms will be less willing to supply at the existing price level, causing supply to fall
#### Changes in technology that improves production process
- Advances in technology have caused production processes to be automated and efficient, with lesser need for labour
- This lowers the marginal cost of production, making firms willing the supply more at every given price, resulting in an increase in supply
#### Change in government policy
- Government policies in the form of taxes, subsidies and regulation can cause the marginal cost of production to increase and hence affect supply
- A fall in the foreign labour quota would cause firms to hire more local workers, which command higher wages, causing marginal costs of production to rise
- An indirect tax would increases marginal costs of production, causing supply of the goods to fall
- A specific subsidy given to producers on the sale of each unit of the good lowers the marginal cost of production,  causing supply to rise
### Changes in production or price of related goods
- Goods are in joint supply if when one goods is produced, another good is also being produced at the same time
- If there is a rise in supply of petrol, there will be a rise in the supply of other fuels as they are in joint supply
- When the price of beef rises, the quantity supplied of beef rises
- This will lead to a rise in the supply of goods that are in joint supply such as leather, as farmers rear more cows now

- Goods are in competitive supply if they require similar factors of production
- If there is a rise in supply of apples, then the supply of oranges falls as farmers are devoting more land for apple production and lesser for orange production
- When the price of beef rises, the quantity supplied of beef rises
- More farmers are incentives to switch production form goods in competitive supply such as chicken, leading to a fall in supply of chicken
### Change in expectation of future price changes
- If  a price of a good is expected to rise, firms may hold back the amount they sell currently
- They are likely to build up their stocks to sell them at a higher price in the future to enjoy higher profit margins
- Thus current supply of the good falls
### Nature, random shocks and other unpredictable events
- Adverse weather conditions such as floods and droughts can destroy crops, leading to a fall in the producers ability to supply these agriculture crops
- Wars and natural disasters can kill many people who are also workers, destroy building and machinery
- Strikes, where workers stop going to work,  banking crisis where firms find it harder to get loans to hire more factors of production can also disrupt production, reducing firms ability to supply
### Change in the number of sellers/ firms
- The market supply is made up of the supply of individual firms in the market
- In the long run, if more firms enter the market, the market supply will rise
- In singpaore, the demand for weheelchairs is rsiing, leading to an increase in the price of wheelcahirs
- Existing firms will react by increasing quantity supplied (movement along SS curve)
- In the long run, new firms attracted by the increased profitability of selling this good will enter the industry, increasing the number of sellers, causing supply to rise (shift in SS curve)

## Interaction of demand and supply
- The equilibrium price/ quantity of a good / service is determined by the intersection of the market demand/ supply curves
- ==Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the price that consumers are willing and able to pay for the good/ service and the market price they actually pay==
- ==Producer surplus refers to the difference between what producers are willing and able to supply the unit of good for and the price they actually receive==
- Total consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the market price, while total producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the market surplus
- They are a measure of consumer/ producers welfare
