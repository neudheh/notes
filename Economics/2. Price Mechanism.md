## Demand
- ==Demand refers to a quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices, in a given time period==
- The law of demand states that that there is a negative/ inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus
### Demand curve
- The demand curve is the horizontal summation of all of the individual demand curves
- The demand curve shows the inverse relationship between the price and quantity demanded of a good by all consumers, ceteris paribus
### Movements and shifts along the demand curve
- If the price falls, the quantity demanded will increase, and this is reflected as a movement along the demand curve
- If there is a change in some factors other than the price of the good itself (non-price factors), there is a change in demand, and there is a shift in the demand curve
- A rightward shift indicates the quantity demanded for the good has increased at every price level, and there is a rise in demand
- A leftward shift indicates the quantity demanded for the good has fallen at every price level, and there is a fall in demand
## Factors that affect the demand curve
### Level of income
- As people's income rises, their ability to buy goods and services increases, causing their demand for normal goods to rise
- When people become more affluent, their purchasing power increases and the demand for normal goods rises
- However, when people becoming more affluent, they will demand lesser inferior goods
### Change in price/ availability/  demand of related goods
#### Change in price
- Substitutes are goods that are in competitive demand (they can satisfy the same needs and may replace each other in use)
- A fall in the price of a substitute would cause consumers to switch away from the good to purchase the relatively cheaper substitute
- There is a rise in quantity demanded for the substitute, and a fall in demand for the good
- Complementary goods are goods that are in joint demand (they are consumed together to satisfy a specific need/ want)
- A fall in the price of a complementary good will increase the quantity demanded, and also increase demand for the good in joint demand
#### Change in availability
- An increase in the availability of substitutes will lead to a decrease in the demand for the goods and vice versa
- An increase in the availability of complementary goods will lead to an increase in the demand for the good that is in joint demand
#### Change in demand
- Derived demand when the good/ service is not demanded for its own sake, but used in the production of another goods
- The demand of this good is thus derived from the other good it helps to produce
- Demand for factors of production (e.g. labor) is derived from the demand for other goods
## Expectation of future price changes
- If people expect prices of a good to rise in the future, they will buy more now before the price increase sets in, therefore current demand for the good increases
- However, this depends if the good can be stored or is perishable
### Tastes and preferences
- The more desirable people find a good, they are willing to pay more for the good, ceteris paribus, the more of it they will demand at any given price
- This is affected by changes in advertising, fashion, and new information
### Government policies
- Government policies such as legislation may change the demand for specific goods and services
- E.g. Anti-smoking laws can reduce the demand for cigarettes
### Interest rate and availability of credit
#### Interest rate
- The interest rate is the cost of borrowing money from banks
- When the interest rate is reduced, loans are now cheaper, and consumers are more willing to borrow money to finance purchases
- This is because the cost of purchase in terms of monthly payments has fallen even though the price of the good remains unchanged
- This increases the purchasing power of consumers
#### Availability of credit
- During an economic downturn, the economy may not be doing well and banks, being concerned of the risk of default, may stop or slow lending
- Banks are more cautious in lending, and the inability of consumers to obtain loans to buy items will lead to a decrease in demand for such goods
- When the economy is doing well, there may be easy credit where loans are easily obtained from banks
- Consumers are incentivised to borrow to purchase items, resulting in a rise in demand
### Population size/ structure
- A rise in the general population would lead to an increase in demand for most goods and services
- If the population structure to change, such as a aging population, there will be a larger proportion of the elderly and a smaller proportion of the young
- The demand for goods and services consumed by the elderly will increase while that consumed by the youth will decrease

## Supply
- ==Supply is the willingness and ability of a firm to offer a good for sale at various prices in a given time period==
- The law of supply states that there is a direct relationship between price and quantity supplied, ceteris paribus
### Supply curve
- The supply curve is the horizontal summation of all of the individual firms supply curves
- It reflects the positive relationship between price and quantity supplied
### Movements and shifts along the supply curve
- If the price rises, the quantity supplied will increase, and there is a movement along the supply curve
- If a non-price factor changes, there would be a change in supply, and a shift in the demand curve
- If the quantity supplied at all price points increase, there is an increase in supply, and a rightward shift in the supply curve
- If the quantity supplied at all price points decrease, there is a decrease in supply, and a leftward shift in the supply curve
## Factors that affect the supply curve
### Marginal cost of production
- An increase in the marginal cost of production will reduce supply, as this will lower total lower profits for the firm, making it less willing to supply the good at every price level
#### Change in the price of factor inputs
- If there is a change in the price of factor inputs, the marginal cost of production will rise, leading to a fall in supply
#### Change in technology
- Advances in technology allow production processes to become more efficient, lowering the marginal cost of production, making firms more willing to supply more at every price
#### Changes in government policy
- Government policies in the form of taxes, subsidies and government regulations can affect the marginal cost of production and hence affect supply
### Changes in price/ production of related goods
#### Production of related goods
- When one good is produced, another good is produced at the same time, and the goods are in joint supply
- A rise in the supply of petrol will cause the supply of kerosene to rise too
#### Price of related goods
- When the price of beef rises, the quantity supplied of beef will rise, and this will lead to a rise in the supply of goods in joint supply, such as leather
### Expectations of future price changes
- If the price of a good is expected to rise, producers may temporarily hold back the amount they currently sell
- They will build up stocks in order to sell them at higher prices in the future to enjoy higher profits, thus current supply falls
### Nature, random shocks, and other events
- Adverse weather conditions (e.g. floods) can reduce agricultural output, leading to a fall in producers ability to supply at every price point
- Wars and disasters can kill workers, destroy buildings and machinery
- Strikes can also disrupt production, leading to a fall in producers ability to supply at every price point
### Changes in the number of sellers/ firms
- In the long run, if more firms enter the market, the market supply will rise
- E.g. The rise in demand for wheelchairs will lead to a rise in price for existing firms in the short run
- In the long run, new firms will join attracted by the profitability of selling the good, increasing supply as the number of firms has risen

## Interaction of demand and supply
- The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity is determined by the intersection of the market demand and supply curves, where quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
- ==Consumer surplus is the difference between the price that consumers are willing and able to pay for that unit of the good, and the market price they pay==
- Producer surplus is the difference between the price that producers are willing and able to supply that unit of the good for, and the price they actually recieve
- Total consumer surplus is the area under the demand curve and above the market price
- Total producer surplus is the area above the supply curve and below the market surplus
- They are a measure of consumer/ producers welfare
