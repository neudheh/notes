	## 1. Weighing benefits and costs
### Market intervention
#### In deciding whether or not to intervene in a market
- A rational government aims to maximise society's welfare
- ==A government will only intervene if the total social benefit is greater or equal to the the cost of intervention==

**Benefits of intervention**
- A government intervenes in a market to correct partial market failure or achieve equity
- The benefit of intervention is the gain in welfare for society
- The more significant the market failure (i.e. the greater the welfare loss)/ the greater the inequity in distribution of output, the greater the benefit of intervention

**Costs of intervention**
- A government incurs monetary costs when it intervenes in a market
	- Administrative costs
	- Monitoring costs (regulations)
	- Production costs (direct provision)
	- Implementation costs (subsidy)
	- Costs of gathering information on the benefits
	- Opportunity cost of intervention (net benefit that could be gained from the next best alternative use of resources put into intervention)
	- Possible trade off with other government objectives (inequity/ allocative efficiency)
#### In deciding in between measures once it has decided to intervene
- Governments will choose the measure has the greatest net benefit to society (total social benefits - total social costs)
- This can depend on the context of the problem

**Benefits**
- Government will consider the benefits or effectiveness of the measures, or how well it leads to the attainment of its intended outcome
1. Information available to a government
	- For measures such as indirect taxes or production subsidies, the government needs to have adequate information to determine the right level of tax/ subsidy
	- For a pollution permits, the government needs to have adequate information to determine the social optimal level of pollution is before issuing the pollution permits
2. Price elasticity of demand
	- The extent of change in price in the quantity demanded when there is a price change depends on the PED
	- Taxes/ Subsidies will be more effective in changing the quantity demanded for a goods that is price elastic, as a change in price would lead to a more than proportionate change in quantity demanded
	- Regulations/ direct provision would be more effective in changing the quantity demanded for a good that is price elastic
	- This is because a change in price would lead to a less than proportionate change in quantity demanded, and there will need to be a higher tax/ subsidy amount to bring the market to the socially optimal level of consumption
3. Whether monitoring and enforcement is required
	- Command measures (regulation) are effective if there is enough monitoring of consumer/ firm behaviour and consistent enforcement of the law
4. Time taken
	- How much time is required for the measures to take effect
	- Public education takes time to change consumers' perception to the true MPB of goods
	- Takes time for consumers to find new substitutes in reacting to a price hike caused by a tax on cigarettes
	- Takes time to equipped the unemployed with the relevant skills by subsidising training courses
	- Regulation/ unemployed benefits would be quicker in changing consumption/ production patterns/ maintain a decent standard of living

**Costs**
1. Financial cost
	- Administrative costs
	- Monitoring costs (regulations)
	- Production costs (direct provision)
	- Implementation costs (subsidy)
	- Costs of gathering information on the benefits
	- When a tax is self-financing (e.g. a tax can earn tax revenue for the government)
	- The use of regulation strains the governments budget as there must be adequate monitoring for the policy to be effective, which can be very costly
2. Political costs
	- Some policies measures tend to be less popular with the people (e.g. mandatory COVID-19 vaccines)
3. Trade-offs
	- A measure to improve allocative efficiency could worsen it in another market
	- A policy to improve allocative efficiency could worsen equity and vice-versa
### Pursuing a project
#### In deciding whether or not to pursue a project
- ==A rational government would only pursue a project if the total social benefit of the project is grater than the total social cost of the project== (such that society enjoys a gain in net total social benefits)

**Social benefits**
- Private benefits
	- Benefits that accrue to users and the producers of the project
	- E.g. Building an expressway -> reduction in transportation costs, reduction in travelling time
- External benefits
	- Benefits that accrue to third parties who are neither user nor producers of the project
	- E.g. Building an expressway -> reduced late coming -> reduced loss of man hours suffered by firms

**Social costs**
- **Private costs**
	- Costs borne by users and/or producers
	- E.g. Construction, operating and maintenance costs
- **External costs**
	- Costs borne by third parties who are neither users nor producers of the project
	- E.g. Building the expressway may lead to environmental degradation (e.g. loss of wildlife and plant life)
	- Displacement of residents in the area s they need to move to make way for the expressway
	- Increase in air pollution causing health problems
	- The government would estimate the monetary value of these non-monetary external costs and include it in the calculation of the total social cost
	- The government might choose to internalise these costs (e.g. relocate wildlife, compensate residents for relocation)
	- This will add to the private monetary costs incurred by the government
### In deciding between projects
- A government might need to choose between projects due to budget constraints
- It will choose the project that yields the highest total social benefit to society
## Constraints
- Government face various constraints in policy making  
- A key constraint is limited financial resources
- Government's main source of revenue is from taxes
- Governments that run budget deficits could finance the deficit via borrowed funds
- But, persistent large budget deficits would eventually reduce creditors' confidence in the governments ability to pay back the loans with interest, and might stop lending
- This harms the government's ability to promote growth due to a lack of accessibility to loans
- In achieving their objectives, governments must be aware of the constraints that they are operating within, as this will determine their choices available to them
- This will then decide on the best-ranked choice which enables them to maximise social welfare
## Gathering information and considering perspectives
- In order to make sound decisions, economic agents have to first gather accurate information, both quantitative and qualitative, on the costs and benefits of every available choice
- The government aims to maximise net social benefit
- It will obtain information that aids them in weighting the total benefits (i.e. benefits that accrue to consumers + benefits that accrue to third parties)
- It will also obtain information on the total costs (i.e. costs of production + costs borne by third parties)

- Economic decisions do not make decisions in isolation of others, as the impact on and subsequent reaction of those affected by it may affect the intended outcome
- The government considers the perspective of stakeholders (e.g. residents, political supporters) in their policy decisions
## Intended and unintended consequences
- Economic decisions are often made to tackle of mitigate economic problems, and the impact of such decision can be analysed in terms of intended and unintended consequences
- Decisions are made with the expectation that the decision will achieve its intended outcome and resolve the economic problem
- The outcome is an intended consequence
- Unintended consequences are outcomes that are not intended in the economic decision
- Decision made by economic agent can have multifaceted implications

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Banning PMDS
>	- Intended consequence -> Fall in the number of e-scooter related accidents, injuries, death
>	- Unintended consequence -> Raise int he number of cycling accidents as food delivery riders may switch to using bikes
>	- This may lower the net benefits of using the measure
>- If the government tries to mitigate these unintended consequences, it increases the overall cost of intervening
>	- The total costs not only include the cost of implementing the ban, but also the cost of compensating PMD owners when banning PMD so that they can afford alternative means of transport
>- Economic agents may not be rational in their behaviour, and the government can use this to make more effective/ appropriate policies
>	- Using loss adversion, a government can use to impose a fine if delviery riders are causgh using PMDS
>	- This would be more effective than providing a subsidy to encourage them to switch to using other modes of transport

>[!TLDR]
>- A rational government aims to maximise society's welfare
>- A government will only intervene if the total social benefit is greater or equal to the the cost of intervention
>- This is subject to budget and resource constaints
>- If the welfare loss from market failure is lower than the costs incurred from intervention to correct the market failure, the government should not intervene
>- This is because the benefits of intervention are lower than the costs of intervention, resulting in a worse outcome for society
