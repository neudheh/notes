## Price strategies

### Third-degree price discrimination
- Third degree price discrimination is a price strategy where consumers are segmented into distinct groups are being charged different price of the same product for reasons not due to cost differences
- Firms charge a higher price for consumers with a more price inelastic demand, and a lower price for consumers with a price elastic demand
- To do this firms
1. Are able to set prices, meaning this is only possible for imperfectly competitive firms
2. Are able to differentiate markets, and PED value differs in each market
	- The seller must be able to identify and separate customers into separate and identifiable groups (e.g. students vs working adults)
	- Each sub-group must have different price elasticities of demand
3. Keep the markets separate
	- There must be no possibility of resale or seepage between markets
	- Price discrimination is not possible if f goods sold in a particular market at lower price, where demand is more price elastic, is resold to consumers from the market where the goods is sold at higher prices and demand is more price elastic
---
- A firms sells output in two markets, working adults in market A, and students in market B
- Demand in market A would be more price inelastic as the good takes up a small proportion of their income
- Demand in market B would be more price elastic as the good takes up a larger proportion of their income
- The combined DD and MR faced by the firm is obtained from adding the DD and MR faced in the two markets
- To decide on the profit-maximising output level, firm will produce up to where MC is equal to the combined MR
- Since PED differs between the two markets, firms can change different prices in the two markets for the same output produced, earning more profits
- Firms charge a higher price and sell lesser in market A
- When $|PED| < 1$, the increase in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- Firms earn more revenue as the increase in revenue from the rise in price is greater than the fall in revenue from the less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- Firms charge a lower price and sell more in market B
- When $|PED| > 1$, the fall in price would lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- Firms earn more revenue as the increase in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded is greater than the fall in revenue from the fall in prices
- With total cost being the same, firms thus earn more profits as total revenue as increased
---
**Consumers**
- Consumers with a price inelastic demand are negatively impacted as they are charged with a higher price, consume lesser and lose consumer surplus
- Consumers with a price elastic demand benefit as they are charged with a lower price, consume more and gain consumer surplus
**Efficiency**
- Price discrimination can bring advantage to the community, especially if it is an essential good, where it is not profitable if a single price was charged
- Firms can earn more revenue to cover cost, allowing the good to be supplied
- There would be provision of goods that would otherwise be unprofitable to produce, improving allocative efficiency
- If firms use profits towards innovation, there is dynamic efficiency
- If firms use profits to break into additional markets, there is a rise in productive and allocative efficiency due to the increased level of competition
**Equity**
- Equity can be improve if the market is segmented to income groups
- Lower-income households spend a larger proportion of their income on essential goods and services, and they may get priced out of services if one price was charged 
- With price discrimination, lower income households, who have income elastic demand, can now afford medical services as the price is lower, improving equity
## Non-price strategies
### Advertising
- ==Advertising is the activity of making a product known the the public to persuade them to purchase it==
- Persuasive advertising is where firms subjectively influence consumers about the quality or desirability of its product
- Relies on aesthetic and emotional appeal, and may involve celebrity endorsement
- Informative advertising relies more on the information of the product, informing consumers about the prices, characteristics, and locations and conditions of sale
- Advertising is done by imperfectly competitive firms, as perfectly competitive firms have perfect information and product homogeneity, thus there is no advertising
- MC firms, with more limited financial resources engage in less costly types of advertising like social media as they only earn normal profits
- Oligopolies have the financial resources to go for extensive advertising in mass media to build brand loyalty, as they earn supernormal profits
---
![[advertising and product innovation.png]]
- Successful advertising can alter the tastes and preferences of consumers towards the advertised product, increasing the willingness of consumers to purchase it
- Hence, there is a rise in demand
- Advertising also creates brand loyalty, and consumers may perceive rival's products to be less-close substitutes (i.e. imagined product differentiation)
- This causes the firm's product to be less price elastic
- With a rise in demand and a fall in PED, firms can charge a higher price and earn higher profits
- Whether profits increase or not depends on whether the increase in total revenue is able to offset the rise in total costs as a result of advertising
- Initially, firms maximise total profit by producing where MR = MC, at output $Q$ and charging price $P$
- Demand increases from $D$ to $D'$ and becomes less price elastic
- But, the increase in spending in advertising causes the average cost to rise form $AC$ to $AC'$
- MC does not change as advertising is a fixed cost
- The rise in total revenue (area $P' \times Q'$ -  area $P \times Q$ ) is greater than the rise in total cost (area $AC' \times Q'$ - area $AC \times Q$ )
- Hence, there is a rise in profits of area $(P' - AC') \times Q'$, and the firms goes from earning normal profits to supernormal profits
---
**Other firms**
- Other firms will face a fall in demand for their products, and a fall in revenue
**Consumers**
- Informative advertising makes more information available. and consumers make more informed decisions to maximise welfare
- Persuasive advertising may distort choices because consumers are led by the advertisement to buy a product for its brand rather than its actual characteristics
- Firms may also use cognitive biases of consumers, such as salience bias
**Governments**
- Informative advertising allows for more informed decisions, and the perceived marginal benefit is close to the true marginal benefit, improving allocative efficiency
- Persuasive advertising distorts consumer choices, and perceived marginal benefit is higher than the true marginal benefit, worsening allocative efficiency

- Firms may also get customers to sign up and pay to become a member of its loyalty program, leveraging on sunk costs fallacy
- Firms may also require their customers to sign contracts where early termination results in losses due to termination fees, leveraging on loss aversion
### Product innovation
- Product innovation entails developing new products or improving the quality of existing goods/ services, through research and development
- Improving the quality of a good over time can result in real product differentiation between the firm's product and its rivals, reducing the degree of substitutability
- This will increase the demand for the good and make it less price elastic as the product is better and more differentiated from its substitutes
- R&D costs are fixed costs, causing AC to rise
![[advertising and product innovation.png]]
*Same explanation as advertising*
### Process innovation
- Process innovation is improving the method of production, leading to a more efficient production process
- This reduces the marginal cost of production form $MC_0$ to $MC_1$
- Average cost will also fall from $AC_0$ to $AC_1$, since average cost is total cost divided by total output
- If average cost falls more than the fall in price, profit per unit for the firm rises
![[process innovation.png]]
 **Other firms**
 - Other firms may see a fall in demand for products, hence a fall in revenue
 - New technologies form firms investment in product quality or production method can deter entry of potential entrants and lower contestability of the market
 **Consumers**
 - Product innovation brings better-quality products, increasing consumer satisfaction and welfare
 - Process innovation lower prices, increasing consumer surplus
**Government objectives**
- Innovation results in dynamic efficiency
- Process innovations improves price competitiveness if happening across many firms, increasing the quantity demanded for exports
- This would increase export revenue if the demand for exports is price elastic, as a movement along AD
- Product innovation improves non-price competitiveness of exports, increasing demand for exports and thus export revenue, resulting in actual growth
- Process innovations improves price competitiveness if happening across many firms, increasing productivity
- There is a fall in unit cost of production and productive capacity, increasing AS, and there is actual and potential growth
- But, innovation can result in changes in methods of production, and may lead to structural unemployment
### Growth and diversification of firms
#### Internal growth
- Internal growth refers to expansion of firms by investment in new plants or outlets
- Firms can also expand internally by growing their market share through advertising or through innovation and development of new products
- When producing a higher quantity of output, firms can reap internal EOS and enjoy lower unit costs of production
- But, perusing growth through internal expansion is uncertain and difficult, as firms face difficulties in raising funds for investments
- Firms cannot be sure if their advertising or investments is successful too
#### External growth
- External growth refers to expansion through mergers or acquisitions with other firms
- Merger is the coming together of two or more firms to create new firms
- Firms may merge with competitors as it can allow for greater supernormal profits to be earned as its ability to reap EOS and market share has increased
- Acquisition is when one firm takes over another firm and completely establishes itself as the new owner
- An established firm can put in a takeover bid for any new entrant easily because of their strong financial capacity
- This will discourage new entrants as their efforts and resources in creating a new company would be eliminated upon acquisition
- External growth allows firms to quickly and surely grow their firm, and allows them to reap EOS, eliminate market competition and increase market share, increasing profits
- But, it could lead to greater likelihood of internal dis-EOS due to difficulties in communication/ coordination among staff due to different working culture
#### Diversification
- Firms can diversify production by venturing into other new products
![[diversification of firms.png]]
**Other firms**
- When a firm expands, its competitors may find it more difficult to compete against the expanded firms as they enjoy greater EOS, allowing it to reduce it prices
- There would be a fall in competitors products if they are unable to match the fall in price, further consolidating the firms market share
- With vertical integration, competitors may face increased challenges in obtaining inputs or penetrating product markets
- This is because the expanded firm has greater control over the previous or next stage of production
- Over time, the competitors are unable to effectively compete against the expanded firm, and will earn subnormal profits, and exit the market
**Consumers**
- With expansion, firms can enjoy cost savings, and if these cost savings are passed on to consumers, they will enjoy a fall in prices
- But, the firm may become a monopoly, and consumers may suffer if the firm becomes able to set higher prices to increase profits
- They may also get poorer quality goods if the firm becomes complacent and does not innovate
**Government objectives**
- As firms earn higher profits, they may invest into R&D, improving dynamic efficiency
- But, when they establish greater market dominance, the level of competition in the market becomes lower, reducing allocative and productive efficiency
- If firms that produce key inputs expand and enjoy costs savings, there would be an increase in AS, resulting in the GPL falling
- There would also be a movement along AD, and thus economic growth
## Collusion
- Oligopolists have a high degree of rival consciousness and mutual interdependence
- Each firm in the industry will consider how its actions will affect its rivals
- They may engage in strategic behaviour, which influences the market environment in which they compete
- A collusion is an agreement among firms to divide the market or fix the market price to maximise economic profits
### Explicit
- A cartel is a formal explicit collusion, where a group of firms establishes a virtual monopoly by agreeing openly on a common uniform price in the market
- The cartel takes over the price and output decision from the firms, behaving as if it was a monopoly
![[collusion.png]]
- The demand curve for the cartel's product is the industry demand curve
- The cartel maximises industry profit by producing up to where the industry's MR = industry's MC
- Each member firm commits to the cartel-derived price and produces and sells only its agreed upon share of the cartel's output
- But, members have strong incentive to cheat on the quota agreement by producing more than their designated quota
- With price and marginal revenue being fixes at a level that is higher than the individual firm's MC, producing more would generate higher profits
### Implicit
- Firms do not come together to agree upon a fixed price, known as informal collusion
- They follow a firm that is the price leader
- The price leader can be a dominant firm that has the largest market share, and any difference in pricing from smaller firms would invite retaliation and a price war
- As the dominant firm has more resources, capacity, and better branding, it is more likely to survive
- It can also be a low-cost price leader, where the firm has the lowest cost of production, and charge a price lower than the average costs of its rivals to inflict heavy losses
- It is usually the dominant firm as the largest firm enjoys the greatest EOS
- It can also be a barometric price leader, which can respond more quickly than its rivals to changing costs and demand conditions
- It is seen as reliable, but does not necessarily have significant market power
- In this case, the price leader acts as a barometer of market conditions for the rest of the industry
### Conditions to be successful
- The number of sellers cannot be too large, as it can be harder to negotiate an acceptable allocation of output
	- Each firm may also find it easier to cheat and produce more, as it is more difficult for other members to find out who cheated
	- Each firms will also have lesser market share, and the consequences of any firm cheating will have lesser impact on the overall market
	- Other firms may not retaliate
- The product has to be homogenous, else each firms MC would be different from each other, making it difficult to agree on a common price
- There has to be a dominant firm that is larger than its rivals to enforce the cartel quotas and punish cheaters by increasing production to lower prices and start price wars
---
- Consumers suffer higher prices and a fall in consumer surplus
- Prices are pushed up higher above MC, as firms agree to act as a monopoly, and there is greater allocative inefficiency
- The ensured profits may make firms complacent and disincentivises innovation and efforts to increase productivity, 
- This results in dynamic inefficiency and possible X-inefficiency
## Criticisms of the profit maximising assumption
- Firms may wish to maximise profits, but are unable to do so due to a lack of information
	- Firms do not know the exact revenue and cost functions as they operate in a dynamic environment, where demand and cost conditions change continuously
	- They may be unable to maximise profits as they are unable to accurately estimate their MR and MC due to imperfect information
- They may have other goals and do not aim to maximise profits in the short run
	- A firm may posses alternative objectives, and want to maximise profits in the long run
	- It may drive competitors out of the market, or deter new firms from entering
	- Hence, it may sacrifice some short run profits form greater market dominance or higher profits in the future
## Market share dominance
### Predatory pricing
- Predatory pricing is an attempt by a firms to undercut its competitors by lowering its price in order to drive its competitors out of business
- It will charge a price below its AC and earn subnormal profits temporarily to drive out its competitors and recuperating their losses in the future by charging higher prices
- They will drive out smaller firms, as they have smaller capacity and lower output level, and will be making normal profits at market price
- With predatory pricing, the price is below their average total costs
- They will earn subnormal profits if they try to match the price, or suffer a fall in demand for their product
- If it persists, they will exit the market in the long run
- This will increase the larger firms market share and market power, and it can raise prices to increase profits in the long turn
- But, if unsuccessful, it will earn subnormal profits which they cannot sustain and will exit the market in the long run
- It tends to be triggered by poor business conditions, where overall market demand is declining for the whole industry
- One of the firms would have to lower prices to clear inventories, which may start a price war
- Firms may also use the recessions to force its rivals into bankruptcy
- In a price war, all firms will suffer lower profits as prices are lowered
- Firms with lower costs or deeper reserves from past profits earned are able to survive a price war as they can sustain losses for longer and outlast their competitors
---
**Consumers**
- In the short run, consumers may benefit as a price war lowers prices and increases output, improving consumer welfare
- In the long run, when predatory pricing has driven out other firms, the remaining firms will have higher market share and charge higher prices, reducing consumer welfare
**Governments**
- In the short term, price wars lower prices and increases output, making it more allocative efficent
- Income is also more equally distributed as firm's supernormal profits are eroded, and consumers benefit from lower prices, leading to a more equitable distribution of goods
- But, in the long run, if the remaining firm establishes a monopoly, it will worsen allocative efficiency and equity as prices are raised
## Entry deterrence
### Limit pricing
- Limit pricing is the minimum price that an incumbent firm can charge in order to make an acceptable level of profit while deterring entry of new firms in the market
- The existence of supernormal profits earned by oligopolists or monopolists will attract new firms
- To prevent potential competitors from entering the market, firms can charge the limit price that is below the short run maximising price, but above the average cost to make normal profits at least
- This is just enough to prevent the entry of new firms
- It means a short run departure from profit maximisation, but if successful, firms maintain their market power and make higher profits in the long run
![[limit pricing.png]]
- The profit maximising price and output where MR = MC is at price $P_1$ and output $Q_1$
- Firms who wish to enter the industry when the oligopolists charge the profit maximising price of $P_1$ can do so by producing at a smaller scale of output $Q_a$
- At $Q_a$, the new firms average cost will be equal to $P_1$, and it earns normal profits and survives
- But, if the oligopolists charges the limit price of $P_2$ and produces at $Q_2$, it can sustain its profits for longer by preventing new firms from entering 
- The new firms would have to produce $Q_b$ to achieve sufficient EOS to compete
- The larger initial firm size makes it tougher for new firms to enter the industry because the financing and risk involved in starting out with a larger scale of operations is higher
### Advertising
- Through advertising, firms build up stronger brand loyalty such that consumers would have an established recognition of their brand in the market
- This would deter potential entrants as consumers would be less likely to purchase the new firms product as they are unfamiliar with it
- They would need to spend extensively on advertising to get consumers to try their product, deterring new firms from entering the market
- Thus, advertising creates a barrier to entry by raising market penetration costs though costly media advertising
![[advertising.png]]
- Advertising builds brand loyalty for the incumbent firm, raising the average cost for potential entrants if they too need to advertise to compete
- This makes it harder for new firms to enter the market
- Without advertising, the cost structure of the firms would be illustrated by $LRAC_1$
- The larger incumbent firm produces at $Q_2$ and averages cost being $C_2$
- The smaller firm produces at a smaller scale, with quantity $Q_2$ and average cost $C_1$
- But, with adverting, there is a rise in the cost structure form $LRAC_1$ to $LRAC_2$ for all firms as they all have to advertise to attract customers
- At low levels of output such as $Q_1$, $LRAC_2$ is higher than $LRAC_1$ as advertising costs are spread over very little output
- As output rises, $LRAC_2$ converges towards $LRAC_1$ as the contribution of advertising to average costs becomes less significant as it is spread over a greater volume of output
- The incumbent firm producing at $Q_2$ would have an average cost of $C_4$ 
- The new firms producing at $Q_1$ would have an average cost of $C_3$
- The cost difference between the larger firm and the smaller firm has increased from $C_1C_2$ to $C_3C_4$ 
- It is more difficult for the smaller firm to compete with the larger firm as it has a higher cost disadvantage, deterring potential entrants
### Innovation
- Through process innovation, incumbent firms can lower their marginal costs and hence prices, making it harder for new firms to compete based on price
- This is because they do not have the same access to technology and knowledge
- Through product innovation, incumbent firms can create better products to build brand loyalty and prevent consumers from switching away to new firms
- Potential entrants would also face lesser difficulty in creating product of comparable high quality to compete with the incumbent firms
- Incumbent firms can also create multiple variants of their products in order to fill the market, making it difficult for new firms to find a niche in the market
---
**Other firms**
- It is more difficult for new firms to enter the market as they have to incur higher costs or find a sufficiently differentiated product to enter the market
**Consumers**
- Consumers may initially benefit from entry deterrence strategies such as lower prices from limit pricing, or increased consumer choice from product innovation
- But, entry deterrence prevents firms with higher quality products form entering, resulting in a loss of potential improvement in consumer welfare
**Government**
- Entry deterrence lowers the level of competition in the market, which is harmful towards allocative and productive efficiencies
- It also prevents newer firms with better and new quality technology/ products which hinders dynamic efficiency 
- This is because the potential technological improvements offered by new firms did not materialise
## Revenue maximisation
- Managerial theories suggest firms that firms are run by professional managers that want to maximise their own utility
- While business owners want to maximise profits, managers want to ensure revenue is maximised as their remuneration are tied to the size of revenue rather than profits
![[revenue maximisation.png]]
- In the revenue maximisation model, firms maximise revenue by producing at the level of output where $MR = 0$
- This is because the success level of managers may be judged the level of the firm's sales
- Managers salaries, power and prestige may depend directly on sales revenue
- Managers promotion aspects may depend on how well they have marketed the product rather than whether profits are maximised
- The firms sales representatives may be paid based on commissions on sales
- Sales revenue is maximised when $MR=0$ at output $Q_3$
- But, profit is maximised at output $Q_1$ where $MR=MC$
- Thus, revenue maximisation leads to a higher output and lower prices
- But, if the minimum acceptable profit is normal profit, the sales revenue maximiser who seeks a satisfactory level of profits will produce $Q_2$
---
**Other firms**
- Firms set a lower price compared to profit maximisation, and there would be a fall in demand in competitor's goods, leading to a fall in competitor's profits
**Consumers**
- Enjoy lower prices
- But, there are lesser profits available to fund R&D, and there is lesser R&D, and there is a potential loss of newer/ better quality products
**Governments objectives**
- Income distribution is more equal as firms earn lesser supernormal profits, which was previously at the expense of consumers having to pay higher prices, improving equity
- But, with lesser profits, there is lesser ability for R&D, hence there is dynamic inefficiency
- There is lesser incentive to be productive efficient due to lack of drive to maximise costs to maximise profits
## Profit-satisficing
- Due to imperfect information, firms may find it difficult to practise profit maximisation as the revenue and cost conditions they face are not fully known
- The cost of obtaining enough information to make profit-maximising decisions could be  high in some cases (e.g. they have several productions/ multiple product offerings)
- Firms may also be content with a profit-satisficing level to avoid stress or perceived challenges from expansion
- Profit-satisficing behaviour occurs when firms aim for minimum acceptable levels of revenue and profit
- Additionally, the shareholders of the firm who aim to maximise profits could be too far removed from the operations of the firm to be fully aware of the optimal decisions that need to be made to maximise profits
- The decision makers, such as regional managed could decide against profit-maximising decisions in cases where they do not stand to benefit
- They could instead achieve a level of profit that is acceptable to shareholders even though it falls below the maximum, and enjoy other benefits like shorter operating hours
## Social objectives
- Some firms have social objectives like environmental considerations or ensuring fair wages
- This means that they would have to sacrifice profits as it incurs higher operating costs or channel profits towards investments in these social causes
- Green firms are firms that strive to reduce their negative impact on the environment or society while maintaining a profit
- It incorporates principles of sustainability into business decisions, supplies environmentally friendly products that replace demand for non-green products, and invests its profits to achieve social objectives
- These may be driven by altruism and environmental ethics, but may also just be a way to win customers and increase revenue
