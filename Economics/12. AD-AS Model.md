- The aggregate goods and services market is the market for all goods and services that make up a country's national output or GDP
- A countries real GDP level is determined by the intersection between aggregate demand and aggregate supply of domestic output
- Price level is plotted on the vertical axis, while national output is plotted on the horizontal axis
- The price level is the price of the entire economy, or the general price level (GPL)
## Aggregate demand
- The aggregate demand refers to the total demand of domestically produced final goods and services that buyer collectively desire to purchase at each general price level (GPL) in a given time period
- The AD for domestic output that can be found by summing planned consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports expenditure of goods and services (X-M)
$$AD = C + I +G + (X-M)$$
- (X-M) refers to the demand for domestic goods and services only
## Why is the AD curve downwards sloping?
- The AD curve is downwards sloping to reflect the inverse relationship between the general price level and real GDP
- When there is a increase in GPL, there will be a fall in real GDP due to these effects
### Wealth / real balances effect
- The wealth of households include the value of financial assets (e.g. bank deposits, shares and bonds) and physical assets (e.g. houses, land) that households have
- Assuming unchanged nominal wealth, a fall in the GPL will increase the real value of households wealth
- As their purchasing power has increased, they are more willing to consume more goods and services at this lower GPL, hence consumption increases, causing a rise in real GDP
### Interest rate effect
- When the average price of everything is lower, households will need lesser money to conduct their normal activities
- This allows them to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds
- This places downward pressure in interests rate, making it cheaper for households to borrow to purchase consumer goods and services on credit
- Firms can also borrow more as the cost of borrowing money has fallen
- Thus, C and I rise, causing a rise in real GDP
### International substitution effect
- When domestic GPL falls, assuming no change in foreign exchange rate and foreign prices, the price of domestic goods relative to foreign falls
- Domestic goods become more price competitive than foreign goods
- Thus, import expenditure (M) decreases as households switch to buying relatively cheaper domestic goods
- Export revenue (X) increases as foreigners buy more local goods
- Thus net export revenue increases, causing a rise in real GDP
>[!NOTE]
>These effects arise due to a change in price level and is reflected as a movement along the AD curve (only a change in AS can trigger these effects)
### Causes in shifts of AD
- A shift in AD occurs if, for any price level, there is a change in factors affecting one or more of its components (C, I, G, or (X-M))
- AD only shifts due to other factors other than GPL
## Shifts in AD due to autonomous consumption
- Planned consumption expenditure consists of two components
	- Autonomous consumption, which are changes in consumption due to non income factors
	- Induced consumption, which are changes in consumption doe to changes in income
- Autonomous consumption causes initial shifts in AD, while induced consumption reflects subsequent shifts in AD due to the [multiplier effect]()
- When considering factors that trigger a shift in AD, we are interested in non-income factors (factors that affect autonomous consumption)
### Expectations about future income level
- Optimism about the future state of the economy leads to high consumer confidence
- When households expect the economy to do well, they expect their income levels to rise in the future
- This stimulate consumption as consumers are now more willing to purchase big-ticket items such as cars and luxury watches
- This rise in autonomous consumption causes AD to rise at every price level, which makes the AD curve shift to the right
- Pessimism and anticipation of an economic downturn would cause consumers to cut back on their expenditure, leading to a fall in AD at every price, causing the AD curve to shift to the left
### Expectation of changes in household's real wealth
### Expectation about future changes of GPL
### Availability of credit
### Interest rate
### Personal income tax rate
