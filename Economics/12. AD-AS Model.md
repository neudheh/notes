## Aggregate demand (AD)
- ==AD is the total demand of domestically produced final goods and services that buyers collectively desire to purchase at each general price level (GPL) in a given time period==
- AD is the sum of planned consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports expenditure on goods and services (X-M)
  $$AD=C+I+G+(X-M)$$
### Why is AD downward sloping
- The downward sloping nature of AD reflects the inverse relationship between GPL and GDP
- When there is a change in GPL, there will be a change in opposite direction in real GDP due to the following effects
### Wealth effect
- The wealth of households include financial assets (bank deposits, shares and bonds), and physical assets (land) that households have
- Assuming unchanged nominal wealth, a fall in the GPL would lead to an increase in the real value of household's wealth
- As their purchasing power has increased, they are more willing to consume more goods and services at this lower GPL, hence consumption rises, increasing real GDP
### Interest rate effect
- When GPL falls, firms and households would need lesser money to conduct their normal activities
- This enables them to save more, increasing the supply of loanable funds, placing downward pressure on interest rates
- The fall in interest rates make it cheaper for households to borrow to purchase consumer goods and services on credit, and for firms to borrow for investment
- This is because the cost of borrowing has fallen
- Thus, C and I rise, causing a rise in real GDP
### International substitution
- When the GPL falls, assuming no change in the foreign exchange rate and foreign prices, the prices of domestic goods relative to foreign goods fall
- This causes them to be more price competitive than foreign goods
- Thus, import expenditure decreases as households switch to buying the relatively cheaper domestic goods, while export revenue rises as foreigners buy more local goods
- Hence, net export revenue rises, causing a rise in real GDP

>[!NOTE]
>These effects arise due to a change in price level and is reflected as a movement along the AD curve (only a change in AS can trigger these effects)
## Causes of shifts in AD (C)
- Planned consumption expenditure consists of
- Autonomous consumption refers to changes in consumption expenditure due to change in non-income factors
- Induced consumption refers to changes in consumption expenditure due to changes in income
- Autonomous consumption trigger an initial shift in AD, while induced consumption is reflected in subsequent shifts in AD
- When considering factors that trigger a shift in Ad, we are interested in non-income factors (factors that affect autonomous consumption)
### Expectation of future income level
- Optimism about the future state of the economy leads to high consumer confidence
- When households expect the economy to do well, they will expect their future income level to rise in the future
- This stimulates consumption as consumers are now more willing to purchase big-ticket items such as cars, increasing AD for goods and services at every price level
### Expectation of changes in household's real wealth
- If hosueholds expect an increase in the real value of their wealth, they will save less and be more willing to consume more
- They will feel 'wealthier' and will demand more goods and services
- AD rises and AD curve shifts to the right
### Expectations of future changes in GPL
- If households expect the inflation rate to rise, they will bring forward their consumption to avoid paying higher prices in the future, 
- This increases the willingness of households to consume goods and services now
### Availability of credit
- A credit crunch is where banks stop or slow lending of funds to business or individuals by tightening the conditions to obtain a loan
- When banks are more cautious in lending, the inability by households to obtain a loan would lead to a reduction in consumption
### Interest rate
- When interest rate falls, the cost of borrowing money is lower, increasing households willingess to borrow, and increasing spending
- This is because the interest payment on loans for consumer durables (e.g. cars) are lower and more affordable
### Personal income tax rate
- Disposable income is income that is available for consumption or savings after deducting income taxes and other compulsory contributions, and adding transfer payments from the government
- If a government imposes a higher personal income tax rate, households will see a fall in their disposable income, reducing their willingness and ability to consume
- AD falls, causing AD to shift to the left
## Causes of shifts in AD (I)
 - Investment is the process of creating capital goods not for current consumption, but for the expansion of the productive capacity of the economy by firms
### Interest rate
- The lower the interest rate, the less expensive it will be for firms to finance their investment
- Firms finance the purchase of capital by borrowing, which requires them to pay interest to their creditors 
- Or they can use their undistributed profits, which would cause them to forgo the interest earned if they had placed these profits a bank
- When the interest rate falls, the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of return, is now greater than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- There will be units of investment that were previously unprofitable but are now profitable as the expected rate of return is now higher than the interest rate
- This will cause investment to increase
### Availability of credit
- Most firms depend on bank loans for invesment
- When there is a credit crunch where banks are less willing/ able to provide credit, business investments will be curtailed
### Expected rate of return of investment
**Expectations of future business conditions**
- When a firm expects an expanding economy and increased profit margins in the future, they will want to increase their capacity by buying more capital
- Investments will increase, leading to a rise in AD
- As the expected rate of returns of investment can change suddenly, it is a major cause of changes in a country's overall level of investment and hence AD
**Technological advancement**
- Product/ process innovation gives rise to new business opportunities, and hence expectations of higher yield from investment
**Corporate tax rate**
- A fall in the corporate tax rate will increase the expected rate of after-tax profits on investment, causing firms to demand more capital goods and increasing investment
## Causes of shifts in AD (G)
### Government policy in response to the state of the economy
- Some governments intervene to stabilise fluctuations AD
- When the government adopts an expansionary fiscal policy by increasing government spending, it will increase AD and cause AD to shift to the right
### Access to credit
- A government will need to borrow money to spend when the tax revenue earned is less then their expenditure (budget deficit)
- The government borrows money form individuals and banks, by issuing government bonds and securities
- When a government persistently runs big budget deficits and creditors are concerned about the government's ability to return the loans, they can stop lending
- The government will reduce its deficit by lowering government spending
## Causes of shifts in AD (X-M)
### Foreign income levels
- An increase in foreign income, ceteris paribus, would lead to an increase in demand by foreigners due to their higher ability to afford goods and services in this level
- This would lead to an increase in export revenue
### Prices of foreign produced goods relative to domestic prices
- An increase in foreign prices would cause domestic households to increse quantity demanded of the realtivley cheaper dometically produced goods and services
- If demand for imports is price elastic, the increase in foreign prices would lead to a more than proportionate fall in quantity of imports demanded, and import expenditure falls
- An increase in foreign prices would cause consumers to increase demand for the relatively cheaper imports instead of their domestically produced goods
- Export revenue rises
### Exchange rate
- If the Singaporean dollar depreciates, the prices of exports in terms of foreign currency falls, and foreigners will purchase more Singaporean goods and services
- This is because it is relatively cheaper, causing demand fore Singapore's exports to rise
- Singaporeans will find imported goods and services more expensive in domestic currency terms, and will switch to purchase domestic goods and services
- This is because it is relatively cheaper, and quantity demanded for imported goods falls
- Assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, the depreciation of the exchange rate will cause net export expenditure to rise
### Protectionism
- Governments may adopt protectionist policy measures to restrict free trade to overcome its negative impacts, causing export revenue to fall
## Multiplier effect
- Assuming there is spare capacity in the economy, a rise in AD will lead to a multiplies rise in real GDP due to the multiplier effect
![[multiplier effect.png]]
- The economy was initially at equilibrium at $E_0$, with real GDP at $Y_0$
- A rise in AD from $AD_0$ to $AD_1$ will cause firms to see an unplanned fall in inventories, and they will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- Firms will pay out more factor income to households and national income rises from $Y_0$ to $Y_1$
- With a rise in income, households will spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services ($C$), increasing induced consumption
- The rest is withdrawn as savings ($S$), taxes ($T$), and import expenditure ($M$)
- The rise in induced CD will lead to another round of unplanned fall in firms inventories
- Firms then react by increasing production and hiring more factors of production
- They will pay more factor income to households and real GDP rises gain from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- Households will then spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services, causing a rise in induced Cd again, as well as another round of increase in withdrawals
- This will trigger multiple rounds of increases in income and the process continues until total withdrawals equal to total injections
- The economy reaches a new equilibrium at $E_1$ where $AD_3$ intersects the AS curve
- There is a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_0$ to $Y_3$
### Size of multiplier
- The size of the multiplier is the number of times by which a rise in equilibrium national income exceeds the rise in autonomous expenditure
  $$k = \frac{1}{1-MPC_d}=\frac{1}{MPW}$$
#### MPS
**Country's attitude towards thrift**
- Americans have higher level of consumerism compared to Asians, who regard savings as a virtue, causing Americans to have a lower MPS and a larger multiplier
**Social security system**
- Some countries have higher savings rate as their governments do nor provide a strong social safety net (e.g. free healthcare)
- Households will then put aside more savings to prepare for retirement and old age expenditure
**Government policy**
- Singapore has the highest savings rate in the world due to compulsory savings in the form of CPF contributions
**Distribution of income**
- Higher income groups have higher MPS than lower income groups, hence a more equitable distribution of income increases MPS and lowers multiplier value
#### MPT
- A country with a higher tax rate will have a higher MPT and a smaller multiplier size
#### MPM
- Due to its lack of natural resources, Singapore has to import most of her consumer goods and industrial raw materials, causing its MPM to be higher
- This causes the multiplier to be smaller due to higher leakages out of the circular flow of income
### Extent of multiplier
#### Leakages
- The size of the multiplier is dependent on the MPW/ MPC
- With a higher MPW, more increases in income is leaked out of the circular flow in each round and less is spent on induced consumption of domestically produced goods 
- This reduces the number of rounds of spending in the multiplier process and hence the overall increase in national income will be smaller
#### Lack of spare capacity
- The multiplier effect and generate increases in real income, employment and output only if there is spare capacity in the economy
- Once the economy is at full employment, any further increases in expenditure will only increase nominal national income, and inflation sets in, causing the GPL to rise
#### Structural rigidities
- Even if there is spare capacity, the multipler effect cna be limited due to the presence of strcutural bottlenecks
- E.g. lack of certain types of resources like skilled labour, fixed capital, enterprise
- When there are insufficient resources for production, the increase in national output at each round of the multiplier process may be limited
#### Time lag
- It takes time for the multiplier to work, from several weeks to months between each successive round of spending to happen
## Aggregate supply (AS)
- ==The AS curve is the level of domestic output that firms desire to produce at different price levels==
### Shape of the AS curve
- Over the horizontal range of AS, real national output is much lower than full employment or potential national output $Y_f$
	- High levels of unemployment or spare capacity exits in the economy
	- Firms are able to employ resources that are suitable for their production, and do not have to resort to inefficient combinations of factors of production, which will drive up the unit cost of production
	- They are willing and able to increase output at the same GPL
- Over the upward sloping range, GPL is rising
	- As firms increase output towards $Y_f$, the economy experiences resource constraints which will reduce efficiency
	- They will resort to inefficient combinations of factors of production, causing factor costs to rise more than total output, which will drive up the unit cost of production
	- Firms will only produce output if it can be sold at higher prices, hence AS becomes steeper
- Along the vertical range of AS, the economy is at full employment $Y_f$
	- Output can no longer rise as resources are fully employed, firms are unable to increase output regardless of increases in the GPL
	- If AD were to rise, only GPL will increase with no change in real output
## Causes of shifts in short-run AS
### Prices of factor inputs
- Increases in prices of either key domestic or imported inputs will drive up the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and shift upwards
### Exchange rate
- Depreciation of the domestic currency will mean firms face a higher price for imported inputs in terms of domestic currency
- This will drive up the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and shift upwards
### Government policies
- An increase in indirect taxes like GST will increase the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and shift upwards
- It is expensive for firms to comply with regulations, as they increase the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and shift upwards
## Causes of shifts in long-run AS
### Government policies that affect quantity of resources
- Government policies pertaining to domestic or foreign direct investment may affect a country's productive capacity
- E.g. Tax incentives, opening more sectors of the economy to attract investment
- This will increase the rate of capital accumulation
- If the rate of capital accumulation is greater than the rate of capital depreciation, capital stock will rise, increasing productive capacity
---
- Immigration and foreign labor policies include controlling the inflow of people into the country or immigrants requiring permission to work in the work force
- This reduces the number of foreign workers firms can hire, reducing the total labor force, especially with an ageing population
- This is reduces the number of foreign workers firms can hire, reducing the total labor force, especially with an aging population
- This is because the number of people leaving the work force is greater than the number of new entrants to the work force
- The quantity of labor falls, causing long-run AS to fall, shifting it to the left
### Change in the quality of labor input
- An increase in education and training in an economy due to an increase in investment in human capital will increase the skills of its people (Quality of labor increases)
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Change in technology
- Investment in new technology improves capital productivity, increasing potential output for all goods and services
- This is because new technology is more efficient than old technology
- This will increase the productive capacity of the economy as the economy is able to produce more goods and services
- This causes long run AS to rise and shift to the right
### Natural disasters
- Natural disasters like earthquakes and tsunamis can destroy and permanently decrease the capital stock of the country
- This lowers firms ability to produce, lowering productive capacity
- This causes AS to fall, and shift to the left
