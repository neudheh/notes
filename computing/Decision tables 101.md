1. Analyse the requirements and the actions to be taken
	- In this example, a shop give customers a discount on goods totalling more than $20
		- 5% for totalling more than $100
		- 5% with a discount card
		- 10% with a discount card and goods totalling more than $100

2. Add the appropriate number of columns
	- The number of columns needed can be calculated by $2^{\ number\ of\ conditions}$
	- Split the number of columns into yes and no for each condition

3. Determine the actions to be taken

4. Simplify
	- If only one condition determines the outcome for multiple cases, causing them to have the same outcome, we can eliminate these other conditions
