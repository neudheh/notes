- A module is a collection of variables and functions that need to be loaded before used
- It can be useful to keep things organised
- We don't usually need all the functions and variables provided by the system to be available all the time
- But, loding functions and making them available takes time time and computer memeory
- It becomes harder to choose names for variable and functions as the names chosen might overwrite of clash with the once provided by Python
## Importing a module
- Import a module using `import (module)`
- We can rename the module by using `import (module) as (name)`
## Importing functions and variables
- We can import functions/ variables from a module by using `from (module) import (function)`
- We can import all the unctions/ variables by using `from (module) import *`
