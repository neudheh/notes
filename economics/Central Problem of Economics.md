# Scarcity, choice and resource allocation
## Resources
- ==The central economic problem of scarcity is where there are unlimited human wants, but limited resources relative to wants==
- A resource is scarce if demand, at a price of zero, exceeds the available supply
- Practically all resources are scarce
## Factors of production
- In economics, the resources used to produce goods and services are called factors of production
- There are 4 factors of production: Land, Labour, Capital and Entrepreneurship
### Land
- Land refers to all the natural resources used or are available for production of goods and services
- Land is needed for factories
- Land also is needed for natural resources such as water, wood, metals, fossil fuels and ores
- Land is exchanged for rent
- The amount of natural resources a country can have is constrained by a country's geographical size and ability to access it
### Labour
- Labour refers the physical and mental effort of people used or are available for the production of goods and services
- Human effort, when humans are willing and able to work
- Labour is exchanged for wage
- Labour can be low or high skill
- Labour is affected the population in working age groups and migration policies
### Capital
- Capital refers to all the man-made physical assets used or are available for the production of tother goods and services
- Can be fixed or circulating
	- Fixed capital is durable and is used time and time again in the production process (buildings, machinery and equipment)
	- Circulating capital (or inventories) refers to items such as raw materials (that are already extracted and processed form the land) and semi-finished goods and stocks of finished goods waiting to be sold
- Capital is exchanged for interest
- Stocks/ bonds/ money are not capital goods/ productive resources as it does not produce anything directly
### Entrepreneurship
- Entrepreneur refers to the person that
	1. Undertakes the risks of production; the uninsurable risks of earning losses as the results of undertaking production
	2. Organises production; controls and combines the other factors of production (land, labour capital) to produce a good or service
	3. Innovates; develops new products or new methods of production
- Entrepreneurship is exchanged for profits
- The entrepreneur is the person who takes overall responsibility for the decision making processes in the firm
	- What to produce, how much to produce, how to produce, how the product will be marketed and so on
## Inevitability of choice
- Scarcity necessitates choice
- ==Choice is how to allocate limited resources among competing uses for the satisfaction of human wants==
- Consumers have limited income and have to decide on what to buy as they cant buy everything they want
- Firms can only afford to pay for a limited amount of resources and have to decide what to produce and what resources to hire
- Governments have limited budget and have to decide how to allocate its spending
## Opportunity cost and trade-offs
- When a choice is made, an opportunity cost is incurred, because each time a scarce resource is used to satisfy a want, an alternative want is sacrificed
- ==Opportunity cost is the cost of using resources for a certain activity, measured in terms of the net benefit that could be derived from the next best alternative forgone==
- For example, a firm that chooses to build housing that can yield $2 million in profits could have chosen to develop pharmaceutical drugs that could have yield $4 million in profits
	- The opportunity cost is the net benefit from developing drugs as it the next best alternative
- A student that pursues a university degree spends a total of $30,000 on tuition fees and book, instead of working as a bank clerk for 4 years, earning $72,000 in total
	- His opportunity cost is the money he could have not spent on tuition, on top of the money earned from the bank as he did not spend it and gets to keep it
- Any resources spent are counted in the opportunity cost
- Any resources that remains constant are not counted in the opportunity cost
# Rational decision making process by economic agents
- There are 3 key economic agents in any economy - consumers, producers and governments
- They interact with each other at both the national and international levels
- Due to the problem of scarcity, they have to make decisions (choices)
- When deliberating on the choices available to them, they need to take into account various considerations
- To achieve their objectives and make the best decision, they need to be aware of the 
	- constraints they are operating within
	- cost and benefits of the decision made
	- and actively consider information and perspectives to weigh the costs and benefits

![Decision Making Triangle](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037352498182225980/1092022491544813598/IMG_9062.jpg?width=915&height=701)
## Objectives of different economic agents
- Rational economic agents aim to maximise their self interest
- Consumers aim to maximise net total utility (satisfaction) from buying goods and services
  $Net\ total\ utility = Total\ utility\ from\ good/service - total\ spending\ on\ good/service$
- Firms aim to maximise their profits from producing and selling goods and services$Profits = Total\ revenue\ from\ selling\ good/service - total\ cost\ of\ producitng\ the\ good/service$
- Governments aim to maximise social welfare when making policy decisions$Net\ total\ social\ welfare = Total\ social\ benefits - total\ social\ cost$
## Constraints
- Economic agents must be aware of the constraints that they are operating withing, as this will determine the choices available to them
- Economic agents will then decide on the best ranked choice to maximise their self interests
- For example, households have limited income, firms have limited financial resources and governments have limited tax revenue collected
- Economic agents face budget constraints
- Governments face the constraint of the social and political acceptability of their chosen mode of intervention on top of budget constraints
## Marginalist principle
- Every economic decision is motivated by a set of benefits and costs
- In making any decisions, every economic agent needs to consider the monetary adn non-monetary costs and benefits of every possible choice
- ==The marginalist principle involves weighing marginal costs and benefits, and helps them decide if they should continue or stop the current or existing activity in their usage of resources==
- Marginal change is a small incremental adjustment to an existing plan of action
- Marginal cost is the additional cost of doing one more unit of activity
- Marginal benefit is the additional benefit of doing one more unit of activity
- According to the marginalist principle, if MB > MC, it is rational to do the activity or do more of it 
	- The addition to total benefit exceeds the addition to total cost
	- Therefore, net benefit is rising
- If MB < MC, it is rational to not do it or do less of it 
	- The addition to total cost exceeds the addition to total benefit
	- Therefore, net benefit is falling
- When the value of an activity is continuous rather than discrete net total benefit is maximised exactly when MB = MC
## Information
- In order to make sound decisions, economic agents have to first gather accurate information, both qualitative and quantitative on the costs and benefits of every available choice
- Consumers buying decisions are aimed at maximising net total utility (satisfaction)
	- They will obtain information that aids them to weigh **private** benefit and costs of different goods
	- E.g. benefits from different goods or services that accrue to the buyer of the good requires them to find out the features of different goods/ services, prices of different goods/ services, etc.
- Firms' production and selling decision are aimed at maximising total profits
	- They will obtain information that aids them to weigh **private** benefit and costs of different goods
	- They will need to do market research to find out
		1. The tastes of consumers
		2. The costs of inputs, purchased or provided by the entrepreneur, needed to produce the goods/ services
- Governments seeks to maximise society's welfare (net total social benefit)
	- It will obtain information that helps then to weight **social** benefits and costs
	- I.e. 
		- The benefits that accrue to consumers  (e.g. the income they are likely to earn as a result of receiving education)
		- The benefits that accrue to third parties who benefit from those who consume education (e.g. a more civil society)
		- Costs of productions (e.g. costs of land, building materials, teachers' salaries)
		- Costs borne by third parties (e.g. noise pollution form building the school)
## Perspectives
- Economic agents do not make decisions in isolation of others, since the impact on and subsequent reaction of those affected by the decisions may affect the intended outcome of the decisions made
- E.g. Producers consider the perspectives of the consumers in analysing the effectiveness of marketing strategies employed, Governments consider the perspectives of stake holders (residents, political supporters) in their policy decisions
## Consequences
- Economic decisions are often made to tackle or mitigate economic problems, and the impact of such decisions can be analysed in terms of intended and unintended consequences
- They can be positive and negative
- Intended consequences - Economic agents make decision with the expectation that the decision will achieve its intended outcome and resolve the economic problem
- Unintended consequences - Refer to outcomes that were not intended in the economic decisions
- Decisions made by economic agents can have multifaced implications (i.e. they affect other economic agents, and can possibly affect the national level or international level)
# The production possibility curve model (PPC)
- ==A production possibilities curve (PPC) shows the combination of the maximum amount of two goods (usually capital/ consumer goods) that an economy can produce within a certain period (usually a year), with a fixed level of technology and when all available resources are fully and efficiently employed==
## Constructing a PPC
- Assumptions underlying a PPC
	- A specific period (e.g. a year)
	- State of technology is constant
	- Total available resources remain the same
	- All resources are fully employed and efficiently used
	
>[!NOTE]- Why have these assumptions?
> We need to have these assumptions, as if we do not, there will be a lot of possibilities and it will be difficult to simplify the economic analysis 

![how_to_construct_a_ppc](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037352498182225980/1081957625853386904/IMG_8456.jpg)
## PPC and microeconomic concepts
*Refer to diagram 1*
- The PPC can illustrate concepts of scarcity, choice, opportunity cost and productive efficiency.
### Scarcity
- Combinations beyond the PPC (outside of the shaded area) are desired due to unlimited wants, but unattainable due to limited resources
- Combinations on and inside the PPC (inside the shaded area) are attainable
### Choice
- The economy must decide which attainable combination to produce
- In doing so, it decides on what to produce and how much to produce
- The chosen output combination is depended on society's preferences
### Trade-offs and opportunity cost
- The PPC is downward sloping, illustrating that when a country produces more units of one type of good, it has to sacrifice some units of the other good
- This is because when a country is producing on the PPC, it is already fully utilising all available resources and the current technology available
- Assuming there are only 2 alternative uses to the resource (consumer or capital goods), producing more consumer goods will incur an opportunity cost of the net benefit forgone from the next best alternative, which is producing more capital goods
>[!note] Increasing opportunity cost
>- Resources are not equally suited for producing different goods
>- For example, as an economy increases production of consumer goods such as agricultural goods,  eventually it has to use resources that are lest suitable for producing agricultural goods, but better suited for producing capital goods
>- Thus, there must be more resources used to produce addition equal amounts of a good
>- More capital goods are given up to produce consumer goods, leading to an increasing opportunity cost
>- ==In order to get an additional amount of a good, society must sacrifice an ever-increasing amount of another good==
>- The concave shape of the PPC reflect this increasing trade-off
### Productive efficiency
- ==Productive efficiency is a situation in which the economy cannot produce any more of one good without sacrificing the production of another good==
- When a country is producing a combination on the PPC, it is producing the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
- Thus, it must sacrifice one good to obtain more units of another good, and is in a state of productive efficiency
- If a country is producing a combination inside the PPC, there is a wastage of resources and the country is in a state of productive inefficiency. There is either
	1. Inefficient use of resources, or underemployment, where resources are engages in production, but operating below potential
	2. Failure to use all resources, or unemployment, where some resources are not used at all for production
>[!Summary]
>- Scarcity: Unattainable combinations beyond the PPC
>- Choice: Need to choose among alternative combinations along the PPC
>- Opportunity cost: Negative slope of the PPC reflects trade-offs while the opportunity cost is the net benefit from the next best alternative forgone
>- Productive efficiency: All points on the PPC
## Shifting of the PPC
- When there are changes in the quality of resources, quantity of resource or technology, there would be a shift of the PPC
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the productive capacity of the economy
### What causes an outward shift of the PPC?
- Increasing the quantity of available resource will cause an outward shift on the PPC
	- Land - Discovery of new mining grounds, fishing grounds
	- Labour - Population growth, inflow of foreign workers
	- Capital - Increased investment in factories, machinery, infrastructures like transport and telecommunication networks
	- Entrepreneurs - Rise in the number of entrepreneurs
- Improving the quality (productivity) of the available resources will cause an outward shift on the PPC
- The productivity of a factor input is the output per unit of the factor input
- If the quantity of resources is the same, but each unit has become more productive, the country's ability to produce expands, causing an outward shift on the PPC (i.e. same number of labour, but producing more)
	- Land productivity can be improved through improved techniques of production (irrigation systems, fertilisers, extraction)
	- Capital productivity can be improved by advancements in technology (improved machinery as a result of R&D)
	- Labour productivity can be improved through increasing the education and/or skills level of the workforce by increasing in human capital (more educated/ skilled labour is more able to make use of the latest machinery or method of production, improving productivity)
> [!NOTE]
> Use the acronym **QQT** to help you remember
> **Q** - Quantity of resources
> **Q** - Quality of resources
> **T** - Technology

### Consequences of the investment-consumption choice
- Capital goods are man-made goods which are used to produce other goods, and are not meant for immediate consumption
- Consumer goods are goods for final consumption, ready for use as they are
- ==Investment is the production of capital goods in a certain time period==
- The more investment a country undertakes (i.e. produces more capital goods), the greater the productive capacity of the country **in the following time period**, allowing the economy to produce more consumer goods in the future (PPC shifts outward)
- But, the trade-off is that consumer goods are sacrificed, means lesser needs and wants are satisfies in the current period
- An opportunity cost is incurred in the form of net benefit from the consumer goods sacrificed
>[!TL;DR]
>Ceteris peribius, the higher the level of investment, the greater the rate of economic growth and the greater the expansion in productive capacity of the economy over time -> outward shift of PPC
- Capital consumption (or capital deprecation) refers tot he reduction in the value of capital goods over a one-year period due to physical wear and tear and due to capital becoming obsolete
- For there to be an increase in the total quantity of capital goods in the economy, the rate of production of capital goods must be greater than the rate of capital deprecation
- If the rate of production of capital goods is lesser than the rate of capital consumption, the rate of economic growth decreases, and the productive capacity of the economy might decrease, causing the PPC to shift inwards
## Efficiency and equity
- Societies aim to achieve the best use of resources
### Efficient use of resources
- The optimal allocation of resources for society is when society's welfare is maximized
- To achieve efficient use of resources in the current period, the following types of efficiency must be achieved
#### Productive efficiency
- Productive efficiency refers to a situation win chich the economy could not produce any more of one good without sacrificing production of another good
- The economy is producing the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
	- All firms need to be producing at the lowest possible average cost
	- All resources to be fully employed
- All points on the PPC are productively efficient
#### Allocative efficiency
- This is a situation in which the economy is producing the combination of output most desired or wanted by society
- Society's welfare is maximized
	- The economy must be producing on the PPC (productively efficient)
	- The economy is producing the combination which maximises society's welfare in accordance with society's preferences
- Only one point on the PPC is allocatively efficient
- Allocative efficiency is attained when the last unit of a good or service provides a marginal benefit equal to the marginal cost
- Productive efficiency does not necessarily mean allocative efficiency, as the output may not be what people want
### Equity
- Equity in distribution of output is the fairness of distribution of output
- Equity is achieved when output is distributed in a way that is considered fair or just, based on society's value and judgement
- Economies can be allocative efficient, but inequitable are unfair if some are extremely rich or extremely poor
- This is because how we decide what society wants is through those who are willing and can pay for what they want
- Income inequality leads to inequitable output distribution, cannot be neglected
- If not alleviated, it can be a source of social discontent which can spell destruction for the economy
- Efficiency might be gained at the cost of equity
