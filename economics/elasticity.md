## Income elasticity of demand
- ==Income elasticity of demand (YED) measures the responsiveness of demand to a change in income, ceteris paribus==
- It is measured by the percentage change in demand for a good resulting from a percentage change income, ceteris paribus
- The income elasticity of demand determines the direction and magnitude/ extent of the shift in demand for a given change in income, assuming all other factors remain unchanged
  $$YED = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ demand}{Precentage\ change\ in\ income} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q}\times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta Y}{Y}\times 100\%}$$
- $\Delta Q$ = Change in quantity demand of the good at a given price, $Q$  = Original quantity demand of the good at the given price, $Y$ = Original income, $\Delta Y$ = Change in income
### Interpretation of YED values

|Value of YED|Types of goods|Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative $(YED <0)$|Inferior (cheaper alternatives, second-hand clothing)| Increase in income leads to a fall in demand, Conversely, decrease in income leads to a rise in demand|
|Positive $(0 < YED < 1)$| Normal (Necessity, rice, bread)|Increase in income leads to a less than proportionate increase in demand, meaning that demand is income inelastic. Conversely, decrease in income leads to a less than proportionate decrease in demand|
|Positive $(YED > 1)$|Normal (Luxury, sports car)|Increase in income leads to a more than proportionate increase in demand, meaning that demand is income elastic, conversely decrease in income leads to a more than proportionate decrease in demand|
- Income is a non-price factor of demand, hence, when income changes there is a change in demand illustrated by a shift in the demand curve
### Factors affecting YED values
#### Degree of 'necessity' of the good
- Necessities have a low income elasticity of demand $(0 < YED < 1)$
- As peoples incomes change, the demand for basic necessities changes less than proportionately 
- This is because we have a limited need to consumer more/ less quantities of basic or necessity goods as our, income changes, especially if we have bee consuming sufficient quantities already
- Luxuries have a high income elasticity of demand $(YED > 1)$
- Luxuries are items we can do without during periods of falling income
- As people's income increases, the demadn for luxury goods rises more than proportionately
- This is because a continued rise in income will give consumers the confidence to go ahead with big-ticket item, like a sports cars and overseas holidays to exotic places
- When incomes fall, households will cut back on these non-essential items and demand will fall more than proportionately
#### Changing perception of the good due to income level of consumers
- The income elasticity of a good may differ for consumers of different income levels
- A good can be considered a normal good at low income levels, but the same good may be regarded as an inferior good at higher income levels
- When income rises rises from an initially low level, the demand for a good such as public transport rises, and the good is considered a normal good
- People buy them as they cannot afford the more desirable substitutes (e.g. cars)
- But, at higher income levels, these substitutes might before affordable, and demand for the earlier good (i.e. public transport) will fall as people switch to more desirable substitutes
- The public transport ride, which was initially viewed as a normal good, is now considered an inferior good
## Cross-price elasticity of demand
- ==Cross-price elasticity of demand (XED) measures the responsiveness of demand for one good to a change in the price of another good, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in the demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in the price of another good
$$XED_{AB} = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ demand\ for \ good\ A}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ for\ good\ B} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_A}{Q_A} \times 100 \%}{\frac{\Delta P_B}{P_B} \times 100\%}$$
- $\Delta Q_A$= Change in quantity demanded for good A at the given price, $\Delta P_B$ = Change in price of good B, $Q_A$ = Original quantity demanded foe good A at the given price, $P_B$ =  Original price of good B
### Interpretation of XED values
- To interpret XED values, we must consider the both the sign and magnitude
- The negative/ positive sign of the coefficient shows the type of relationship between the two goods

|Sign|Relationship between goods A and B|Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative $(XED_{AB} < 0)$|Complementary goods (Bread and butter)| If the price of good B (Bread) rise, the quantity demanded of good B falls, and lesser of good A (butter) will be demanded. If the change in demand of good A and the change in price of good B are in opposite directions, XED will be negative|
|Positive $(XED_{AB} > 0)$|Substitute goods (Butter and margarine)| If the price of good B (Margarine) rises, the quantity demanded of good B falls, and more of good A (butter) will be demanded. If the change in demand for good A and the change in price of good B are in the same direction, XED will be positive|
|$XED_{AB} = 0$| Independent goods|If the price of good B rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, but demand for good A will be unchanged|
- The absolute size or value of the coefficient show s the degree of suitability or complementarily
- Goods that are close substitutes or complements have a high magnitude of XED
### Factors affecting XED
- The main determinant of the magnitude of cross-price elasticity of demand is the closeness of the substitute or complement of the good
- The closer the relationship between these two good, the larger the effect on the demand of the good given a change in the price of the related good
- Large positive XED values indicate very close substitutes, while large negative XED values indicate very close complements
- Close substitutes must be the same price range
- The cross price elasticity of demand for good A with respect to the price of good B can be different from the cross price elasticity of demand for good B with respect to the price of good A (i.e. $XED_{AB} â‰  XED_{BA}$ )
- This is because of the different price ranges of the two goods
## Price elasticity of demand
- ==Price elasticity of demand (PED) measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded for the good to change in its price, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in quantity demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of that good, ceteris paribus
- When price changes will all other non-price demand factors remaining constant (i.e. ceteris paribus), PED will measure how much quantity demanded will change
$$PED = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ a\ good}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ a\ good} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q}{Q} \times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta P}{P} \times 100\%}$$

- $\Delta Q$ = Change in quantity demand of the good,  $Q$  = Original quantity demand of the good, $\Delta P$ = Change in price of the good, $P$ = Original price of the good
### Interpretation of PED values
- Mathematically, PED has a negative sign because of the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded
- It varies from zero to infinity

|Value of PED| Explanation|
|-|-|
|Perfectly price inelastic demand $(\lvert PED\rvert = 0)$|For a given percentage fall/ rise in price, the quantity demanded for the good remains the same, and demand for the good is perfectly price inelastic|
|Price inelastic demadn $(0 < \lvert PED \rvert < 1)$|When a give percentage rise/ fall in price brings about a less then proportionate fall/ rise in quantity demanded, the demand for the good is said to be price inelastic|
|Price elastic demand $(\lvert PED \rvert > 1)$| When a given percentage rise/ fall in price brings about a more than proportionate fall/ rise in quantity demanded, the demand for the good is said to be price elastic|
|Perfectly price elastic demand $(\lvert PED \rvert = \infty)$ | At the given price, quantity demanded is infinitely large. Any increase in price will cause quantity demanded to drop to zero. The demand for the good is said to be perfectly price inelastic|
- Mathematically, every point along any straight line demand curve has varying price elasticity of demand
- It is not the gradient
![[PED on a graph.jpeg]]

>[!NOTE] Drawing demand curves
>- We only change the gradient of a demand curve to show PED because we are lazy!
>- For price inelastic demand $(0 < |PED| < 1)$, draw a graph with a steep gradient
>- For price elastic demand, $(|PED| > 1)$, draw a graph with a gentle gradient

### Factors affecting PED
#### Number and 'closeness' of available substitutes
- The more numerous and closer the substitutes, the more price elastic is the demand for the good
- An increase in the price of a good causes its substitutes to become relatively cheaper
- If there are numerous substitutes, a percentage increase in price tends to lead to a larger percentage fall in quantity demanded for that good because consumers can easily switch substitutes
- The closeness of the substitutes are affected by a few factors
- The definition of the good can affect the PED, which depends on how widely/ narrowly the good is defined
- The demand for narrowly defined goods/ services (e.g. Nescafe coffee/ old town white coffee) will be price elastic as there are many other close substitutes available (e.g. other brands)
- The demadn for goods which are widely defined (e.g. meat or food) is price inelastic as there are very few close substitutes available
- Close substitutes must also be within the same price range
- The smaller the price difference, the closer the substitutes
- Successful advertising raises demadn by bringing the product to more people's attention and increases people's desire for it
- It also reduces the price elasticity of demand for the good (demand becomes more price inelastic) because it create greater brand loyalty
- Consumers perceive competitor brands as poor substitutes, allowing the firm to raise its price above that of its rivals with no significant fall in the quantity sold
##### Proportion of income spend on the good
- The larger the proportion of the consumers' income (or budget) the good takes up, the greater the price elasticity of demand
- When the price of such goods rises, consumers' ability to afford them is lowered more significantly and so quantity demanded for these goods will fall more than proportionately
#### Degree of necessity
- A necessity is a good/ service that consumers will buy regardless of the change in income
- The more necessary a good/ service is, the lower will its price elasticity of demand
- When the price of a product rises, ceteris paribus, consumers' real income falls and this would lower their ability to buy the good
- But, when the product is a necessity (e.g. rice), the quantity demanded would not be so greatly affected and is thus price is not greatly affected
- If the price of a luxury good rises, quantity demanded would probably fall by a larger percentage than the price rise and demand is price elastic
#### Habit-forming nature of good
- When a product is habit-forming, such as addictive goods and alcohol and tobacco, other goods become poor substitutes
- To an alcoholic, when the price of alcohol rises, quantity demanded will not fall much they are addicted to it and view other substitutes and soft drinks as poor substitutes
#### Time period
- Demand will be more price elastic in the long run, than in the short run, ceteris paribus
- Time is needed for consumers to find suitable substitutes after a price change and to alter their expenditure patters
- Imperfect knowledge about price changes in the short run, as consumers do not have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices at all times
## Total revenue/ total expenditure
- The total expenditure paid by consumers/ household for the purchase of goods and services is equal to the total revenue received by firms/ producers form the sale of goods and services
$Household's\ expenditure\ (TE)$
$= Price\ (P) \times Quantity\ bought/sold\ (Q)$
$= Total\ revenue\ (TR)\ received\ by\ firms$
### Price elastic demand
- A change in price brings about a change in total revenue (TR) in the opposite direction to the price change
- Decrease in price leads to an increase in TR
- If price falls from $a$ to $c$, TR increases because the loss in revenue from the fall in price (area $abdc$) is lesser than the gain in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded (area $degf$)
- Increase in price leads to a decrease in TR
- If price increases from $c$ to $a$, TR increases because the gain in revenue form the fall in price (area $adbc$) is lesser than the fall in revenue from the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded (area $degf$)
![[TRTE for price elastic demand.jpeg]]
### Price inelastic demand
- A decrease in price leads to an increase in total revenue
- If price falls from t to v, TR decreases because the loss in revenue from the fall in price (area $tuwv$) is more than the gain in revenue from the less than proportionate rise in quantity demanded (area $wxzy$)
- Increase in price leads to an increase in total revenue
- If price rises from v to t, TR increases t because the gain in revenue form the rise in price (area $tuwv$) is more than the lass in revenue form the less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
![[TRTE for price inelastic demand.jpeg]]
*Price only changes due to a shift in supply!!*
## Price elasticity of supply
- ==Price elasticity of supply (PES) measures the responsiveness of a quantity supplied to a change in price, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in quantity supplied of a good resulting from a percentage change in its price, ceteris paribus
- Sign of price elasticity is positive as there is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied of a good
$$PES = \frac{Precentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ supplied\ of\ a\ good}{Precentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ a\ good} = \frac{\frac{\Delta Q_s}{Q_s}\times 100\%}{\frac{\Delta P}{P} \times 100\%}$$
### Interpreting PES values

|Value of PES|Explanation|Diagram|
|-|-|-|
|Price elastic supply $(PES > 1)$| A given percentage change in price brings about a more than proportionate change in quantity supplied|![[PES > 1.jpeg]]|
|Price inelastic supply $(0 < PES < 1)$|A given percentage change in price brings about a less than proportionate change in quantity supplied|![[0<PES<1.jpeg]]|
|Perfectly price elastic supply $(PES = \infty)$|Producers are able to sell at whatever quantity they want at the given price|![[PES = INF.jpeg]]|
|Perfectly price inelastic supply $(PES = 0)$|A fixed quantity that the producer can sell regardless of the price|![[PES = 0.jpeg]]|
### Factors affecting PES
#### Time period
- Price elasticity of supply depends on the ease with which output can be expanded or reduced in response to a change in price
- This in turn depends on the time periods firms have to adjust their production processes
- Supply is more price elastic in the long run than in the short run because producers have more time to make changes to production processes
- In a very short run, the period is so short that all factors of production cannot be varied, and the quantity supplied is unable to response to a change in price, causing supply to be perfectly price inelastic
- In the short run, there is at least one fixed factor of production, and all others can be varied, and when price rises, firms can only adjust by using more of the variable factors to increase production, causing supply to be relatively price inelastic
- In the long run, all factors of production are variable, but the state of technology remains changed
- Long run supply is more price elastic than short run supply as existing firms can increase output by increasing all factors of faction (i.e. no longer constrained by existing production facilities)
- New firms can also respond by entering the industry as it is now more profitable, and quantity supplies is likely to increase more than proportionately in response to the rise in price
#### Behaviour of marginal costs as output changes in response to price changes
- Supply is likely to become more price elastic if firms have plenty of spare capacity to increase production without a huge rise in marginal costs
- Firms will be able to respond to a given rise int he price of a good by producing a more than proportionate amount if they have existing resources that are easily available and affordable
- Supply is also more price elastic if firm if they can switch away from producing alternative products easily (i.e. factors of production are mobile - the can be easily transferred from the production of one good to another without a large rise in marginal costs)
#### How the good is defined
- Price elasticity for supply is greater for more narrowly defined goods
- The supple of nike shoes is more price elastic than that of other shoes as it is easier for Nike to obtain factors of production from other shoe firms compared to the shoe industry obtaining factors of production from other industries
## Answering technique
### Extent of a change in price
- Explain the shift in demand and supply
- Explain why the good has price elastic/ inelastic demand/supply 
- For a shift in supply, see if demand is more elastic/ inelastic, and for a shift in demand, see if supply is more elastic/ inelastic
> - Primary products are goods that have not been processed and is in its natural state specifically agricultural products (e.g. wheat, grains, meat) and mining (e.g. crude oil, iron ore)
> - The demand for such products tends to be price inelastic as there are a few close substitutes. When there is a rise in price, consumers few alternatives to switch to and quantity demanded will fall less than proportionately
> - The supply for such products is price inelastic as the factors of production to produce such products cannot be increase easily (e.g. land to grow what, oil reserves) in the short run
- Draw diagram
- Explain the new price change
> - Hence, when demand and supply are both price inelastic, a shift in supply will result in price changing by a large extent
### Change in price and quantity for simultaneous shifts in demand and supply
- The change in equilibrium price and quantity depends not only on the direction of the change, but also the relative magnitude/ extent of the change in demand or supply
- Explain the shift in demand and supply
- Evaluate why supply/ demand would have fallen more
> - The fall in supply is likely to be more significant than the fall in demand as prolonged floods would have reduced supply significantly
> - The demand for agricultural produce likely only fell marginally when income fell since demand for such produce is income inelastic ($0 < YED < 1$)
> - The larger fall in supply relative to demand will cause a shortage at the existing price, causing price to rise to eliminate the shortage
![[elasticity simultaneous shifts in demand ans supply.jpeg]]
- Explain why the good has price elastic/ inelastic demand/supply 
> - The demand for agricultural products tends to be price inelastic nature as there are a few close substitutes for wheat or grains. When there is a rise in price, consumers have few alternative to switch to
> - Supply for agricultural produce is price inelastic too since the factors of production to enhance agricultural produced cannot be increased easily (e..g land to grow wheat)
- Show the rise in price
> - Since demand and supply are both price inelastic, a large rise in price is required to eliminate the shortage, since the rise in price will result in a less than proportionate fall in quantity supplied and a less than proportionate increase in quantity supplied
> - Price will have increased sharply($P_1$ to $P_2$) relative to the fall in quantity ($Q_1$ to $Q_2$) at the new equilibrium $E_2$
### Prediction of change in total revenue/ total expenditure for simultaneous shifts in demand/ supply
- To analyse the impact of the total revenue of agricultural producers, we will need to analyse the changes in supply and demand step by step
- Analyse the change when holding demand constant
> - Holding demand constant, the fall in supply from $S_1$ to $S_2$ will cause a rise in price from $P_1$ to $P'$
> - Since demand is price inelastic, the rise in price will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded from $Q_1$ to $Q'$ 
> - Total revenue thus increases from $0P_1E_1Q_1$ to $0P'E'Q'$ as the equilibrium point moves from $E_1$ to $E'$
- Analyse the change when holding supply constant, continuing from the total area previously calculated
> - Holding supply constant at $S_2$, the decrease in demand form $D_1$ to $D_2$ would result in a fall in total revenue from $0P'eE'Q'$ to $0_2E_2Q_2$ since both price and quantity decreases as demand falls
> - Demand is likely to fall by a smaller extent than the fall in supply due to the prolonged flood, coupled with a very price inelastic demand, and  demand for an agricultural good is income inelastic
> - the increase in total revenue from the fall in supply will outweigh the fall in total revenue from the fall in demand, causing an overall rise in total revenue
## Elasticity in decision making for firms 
### Price inelastic/ elastic demand
- For goods with price inelastic demand, firms could consider raising the prices of such goods since this will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- As a result, total revenue of the firms will rise
- To reduce the price elasticity of demand for a good, firms can adopt strategies like advertising to create brand loyalty
- On the other hand, firms selling goods with price elastic demand can consider lowering the price to raise total revenue
### Positive/ negative income elastic/ inelastic demand
- When an economy is doing well, demand for normal goods (i.e. $YED > 0$) rises and goods with $YED > 1$ will do exceptionally well
- Firms can consider allocating more of its resources to provide these higher-end products as the rise in demand will be significant and the firm's revenue is likely to rise significantly too.
- During a recession, demand for inferior goods (i.e. $YED <0$) will rise, and firms will now reallocate resources to producing lower-end products 
### Positive/ negative cross price elasticity of demand with high/ low magnitude
- If there are many rivals in the industry selling similar products (i.e. the firms is selling a good with a high cross price elasticity of demand), the firm can respond to a fall in price of its rival's good by reducing the substitutability of its own product through advertisements, improving the quality of the good, or providing better service at its outlets
- For multi-product firms that sell complementary goods, firms can reduce the price of a good to raise the demand of its complement
## Elasticity in government policy making
### Income elasticity of demand
- Knowledge of YED will enable the government to implement better policies to meed the aspirations and needs of her people
- With rising income, the government can decide to allocate more land for private housing as demand for it should rise more than proportionately as the income elasticity for demand for private housing is likely to be high
- During a recession, knowledge of YED will help a government deciding on which industries need assistance
- With a very high and positive income elasticity of demand, firms selling luxury goods will face a more than proportionate fall in demand for their goods and might need more assistance form the government
### Cross-price elasticity of demand
- A fall in price on public transport can reduce the demand for private cars usage as the XED is is positive
- If the XED for private car usage with respect to MRT travel is highly positive, meaning they are close substitutes, the positive is more likely to be effective
- But, if the XED for private car usage with respect to MRT travel is highly positive but low, not many people will switch from private car usage to taking the MRT, hence effectiveness of the policy will be low
### Price elasticity of demand
- If the government want to raise tax revenue, then it should impose indirect tax on goods with price inelastic demadn (e.g. tobacco and liquor) as tax revenue will rise given a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- On the other hand, if the aim of the government is to alter consumers' behaviour by discouraging the consumption of these goods, then this is likely to be ineffective since the fall in consumption will be minimal given the addictive nature of the goods and hence its price elastic demand
### Indirect taxation
- An indirect tax is a compulsory levy imposed on the sale of goods and services, and the producer or retailer has the legal responsibility to pay the tax to the government
- There are two types:
	- A specific tax, where it is a tax that is levied as a fixed amount per unit sold, irrespective of price (e.g. $0.50 per litre of oil); 
	- An ad valorem tax, where it it a tax that is levied as a percentage of the selling price of the goods (e.g. 3% on the price of a litre of oil)
![[elasticity tax.jpeg]]
- When a indirect tax is imposed on a particular good, the marginal cost of production rises by the amount of the tax per unit
- This causes a leftwards shift of the supply curve to $S_2$
- The amount taxes is equal to the vertical distance between the two curves
- The fall in supply causes the equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and the equilibrium output to fall to $Q_2$
- Consumers pat a higher price at $P_2$ (the equilibrium price), while producers receive a lower price of $P_0$ for each unit of the good
- Initially, consumer surplus was area $abP_1$, but with the tax, price has increased to $P_2$ and quantity has fallen to $Q_2$, and the new consumer surplus is area $acP_2$, and there is a loss in consumer surplus of area $P_2cbP_1$ 
- Initially consumer surplus os area $P_1be$ but with the tax, the new consumer surplus is represented by area $P_0de$
- The total tax revenue is equal to the tax per unit X units sold = $P_2P_0 X 0Q_2$ = $P_2cdP_0$ as tax revenue
- The amount of tax revenue collected depends on the price elasticity of demand, the tax revenue is greater when demand for the good is more price inelastic
- This is because a tax (which causes price to increase) leads to a less than proportional fall in quantity demand for a good facing a price inelastic demand
- In contrast, a tax will lead to a larger fall in quantity demanded for a good facing a more price elastic demand, and the total tax revenue collected is lesser
![[tax revenue collected.jpeg]]
### Subsidy
- A subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods/ services, but not in exchange for any goods/ services
![[elasticity subsidy.jpeg]]
- When a subsidy is provided on a particular good, the marginal cost of production falls by the amount of subsidy per unit
- This cases a rightwards shift in the supply curve towards $S_2$
- Equilibrium price falls to $P_2$ and equilibrium output rises to $Q_2$ 
- Consumers pay a lower price $P_0$ for each unit of the good while producers receive a higher price of $P_2$ 
- Initially consumer surplus is represented by the area $abP_1$, but with the subsidy, price falls to $P_2$ and quantity demanded rises to $Q_2$, and the new consumer surplus is area $acP_2$, and there is a gain in consumer surplus of area $P_1bcP_2$
- Initially, producer surplus was area $P_1bd$, but with the subsidy, producer surplus is area $P_0ed$ and there is a gain of producer surplus of area $P_0ebP_1$ 
- Total expenditures by the government on the subsidy = subsidy per unit X units sold = $P_0P_2 \times 0Q_2$ = area $P_0ecP_2$
- The size of the government's expenditure depends on the price elasticity of demand; the government's expenditure on subsidy is greater when demand for the good is more price elastic
- A subsidy (which causes a fall in price) leads to a more than proportionate increase in quantity demand for a good facing a price elastic demand
- In contrast, the subsidy will lead to a smaller increase in quantity demanded for a good facing a more price inelastic demand
![[government expenditure.jpeg]]
## Limitations
- Elasticity measures are based on the assumption of ceteris paribus, which is rarely true, causing estimates to be unreliable (e.g. a firm cutting price to increase total revenue may not work as other firms may also cut price as they do not want to lose market share and total revenue)
- Elasticity values are based on past data and may not reflect in current changes in taste and preferences, etc
- Calculation of elasticities are based on small changes in price, income or prices of other goods. If there is a large percentage change, then the estimate of elasticity may be inaccurate and a false prediction will result
