## Measures to influence the prices of goods/services
### Price controls - Price Ceiling
- ==A price ceiling is the maximum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a particular good or service==
- For the price ceiling to be effective, the price must be set below the market equilibrium price
- A maximum price that is set above or at the market equilibrium price would have no effect at all since the market equilibrium price is still attainable
- Maximum pricing is usually used to control the price of essential goods and services, with the objective to make these goods affordable
- At the maximum price, there is a permanent shortage of $Q_D -Q_S$ units as $Q_D > Q_S$ 
- Without a price ceiling, a shortage would lead to an upward pressure on price, causing prises to rise until equilibrium is restored
- Price plays a rationing function, those who are willing and able to pay a higher price will get the good/ service
- But, the price ceiling creates a permanent shortage 
- An alternative allocation system is required, such as first-come first served, rationing through coupons, seller's preference or random allocation

#### Welfare effects - Marginalist principle
- Assuming that the initial equilibrium output, $Q_E$ was allocative efficient
- A price ceiling of $P_{MAX}$ creates a shortage of $Q_SQ_D$ units
- The quantity sold drops from $Q_E$ to $Q_S$ , and the quantity sold is now lesser than the socially output level $Q_E$
- The resulting fall in output by $Q_E - Q_S$ units causes a welfare loss equal to area $uew$
- For each of the $Q_E - Q_S$ units, there would have been a net welfare gain if those units were produced
- For the additional $Q_E - Q_S$ units, the increase in total social benefit (Area under MSB curve) is greater than the increase in total social cost (area under MSC curve) if those units were produced
- The difference in area is the resulting welfare loss

#### Welfare effects - Consumer and producer surplus
- Initially, consumer surplus is represented by the area $aeP_E$
- With the maximum price, the new consumer surplus is represented by the area $auwP_{MAX}$ 
- Consumers who are able to obtain the good at the lower price benefit
- But there will be some who are no longer able to obtain the good as the quantity purchased drops form $Q_E$ to $Q_S$ 
- The change in consumer surplus depends on the relative sizes of area $ued$ and area $P_EdwP_{MAX}$ 
- Initially, producer surplus is represented by the area $P_Ecb$
- With the maximum price, the new producer surplus is represented by the area $P_{MAX} wb$
- Comparing the sum of consumer and producer surplus before and after, there is a net loss of $uew$
### Price controls - Price floor
- ==A price floor is the minimum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a particular good or service==
- A minimum price can be implemented via two methods, by law (legislation), or by a government guaranteeing to buy up the good at a stipulated price
- Producers are prohibited from selling below the stipulated price, but prices can rise above it
- For it to be effective, it must be set at a price above the market equilibrium price
- Governments may want to use a price floor to protect the income of low-income producers, either by raising producer's revenue, or by preventing their revenue from falling
- This helps to increase their income levels, reducing inequity
- This ensures that the prices of goods and services will not fall considerably, stabilising prices and producers' income
- However, this will generate a persistent surplus
- With the minimum price policy, the market price rises to $P_{MIN}$  and the quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$ while quantity supplied rises to $Q_S$
- This creates a surplus of $Q_s-Q_d$ units
- The government will incur an expenditure of $Q_djmQ_s$ if it steps in to buy up and store the surplus
- Without the minimum price,
	- Firms total revenue: $P_ee0Q_E$
	- Consumers total expenditure: $0P_eeQ_E$
- With the minimum price:
	- Firms total revenue: Consumers total expenditure + govt spending = $P_{MIN}JQ_D0 + jmQ_sQ_D$ = $P_{min}mQ_s0$
	- Consumers total expenditure: $P_{MIN}JQ_D0$

#### Welfare effects - Consumer and producer surplus (By legislation)
*for marginalist principle, just compare TSB and TSC for under produced units* 
- From figure 5, assume that the initial equilibrium output $Q_E$ is allocative efficient
- The quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$ as a result of the minimum price legislation
- Consumer surplus is lowered from $aeP_E$ to $ajP_{MIN}$ (Loss of $P_{MIN}jeP_E$)
- Assuming perfect information, producers would reduce their quantity supplied accordingly to $Q_D$, as producing any more than $Q_D$ would result in a surplus 
- This surplus would require producers to incur storage costs or result in wastage of the product, especially if it perishable
- The minimum price leads to a change in producer surplus from $beP_E$ to $bkjP_{MIN}$ 
- Comparing the sum of consumer and producer surplus before and after, there is a net loss of $jek$
#### Welfare effects - Consumer and producer surplus (By government guaranteeing a minimum price and buying up a surplus)
- From figure 5, assume that the initial equilibrium output $Q_E$ is allocative efficient
- The quantity supplied will then increase to $Q_S$ units while quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$ units, creating a surplus at $P_{MIN}$, which the government has committed to buy up
- Consumer surplus decreases from $AeP_E$ to $Ajp_{MIN}$ (Loss of $P_{MIN}jeP_E$)
- Producer surplus from increases $beP_E$ to $bkjP_{MIN}$  (gain in producer surplus of $P_{MIN}meP_E$)
- The sum of consumer and producer surplus increases by the amount `jme`
- This increase of CS + PS came at a cost to society in the form of the government having to incur a spending of `Q_DjmQ_S` in order to buy up the surplus of $Q_S-Q_D$ at $P_{MIN}$
- Subtracting the loss form the gain, society as incurred a net welfare loss of the M -shaped area $Q_DjemQ_S$ due to allocative inefficiency due to mis allocation of resources
- The producers are the beneficiaries of the government-supported price floors, while consumers are forced to buy less and pay more than they would otherwise
### Production subsidy
- ==A production subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, but not in exchange for any goods or services==
- Subsidy lowers the marginal cost of production as firms now receive a payment for each unit sold, causing the supply curve to shift to the right from $S_1$ to $S_2$
- Consequently, consumers pay a lower price $P_2$ for each unit of the good as the equilibrium price falls from $P_1$ to $P_2$ and quantity rises from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- The subsidy per unit is the distance between $P_0$ and $P_2$ 
- The government spends area $P_0ecP_2$ on the subsidy
>[!NOTE]
>- The extent to which equilibrium price falls and equilibrium quantity rises depends on the price elasticity of demand (PED)
>- The more price elastic the demand the good is, the price will fall less significantly, but the quantity consumed will increase sizeably
- Subsidies are commonly given to producers of necessities such as food and essential goods like healthcare services to improve equity in distribution of goods/ services
- They do so by lowering the prices of essential goods and services, increasing the affordability of the output for consumers
- The subsidies are also used to improve the livelihoods of producers in some cases
![[production subsidy equity.png]]
#### Welfare effects
- The welfare effects of a subsidy depends on whether the initial equilibrium output determined by the free market was allocative efficient
- If initially, the equilibrium output was lower than the socially optimal level of output and thus allocative inefficient, subsides could increase output level to the allocative efficient level
- But, if the initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient, the imposition of subsidies will result in welfare loss/ allocative inefficiency
#### Welfare effects - Marginalist principle
- Assume that the initial equilibrium output level is allocative efficient
- A production subsidy reduces the MCOP for the firms, causing supply to increase and shift downwards from $S_1$ to $S_2$
- The rise in supply results in a fall in the equilibrium price from $P_1$to $P_2$ and a rise equilibrium quantity from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$ 
- The subsidy results in an increase in output of $Q_1 - Q_2$
- Since the subsidy increases production beyond the optimal level of $Q_1$, there is now allocative inefficiency from over production of the good
- Too much resources are being channel to the production of the good, resulting in a welfare loss to society of area $bce$
- For an additional $Q_1 - Q_2$ units, the increase in total benefit (Area under MSB curve) is lesser than the increase in social cost (area under the MSC curve)
- These additional units that are produce result in a welfare loss
#### Welfare effects - Consumer and producer surplus
- The production subsidy causes the equilibrium price to fall from $P_1$ to $P_2$ and equilibrium quantity to rise form $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- As a result consumer surplus rises by area $P_1bcP_2$ while producer surplus rises fby area $P_0ebP_1$
- Governments total spending on the subsidy is equal to the subsidy per unit x quantity sold = area $P_0ecP_2$ 
- The net loss of welfare to society = $P_1bcP_2 + P_0ebP_1 - P_0ecP_2 = bec$
### Promotion of R&D to improve production process
- The price of necessities like water or food crops can be lowered if process innovation could take place
- This leads to decreases in the marginal cost of production, which in turn leads to a rise in supply
- Ceteris paribus, the rise in supply will lead to surplus at the original market equilibrium price of $P_1$, causing a fall int he market equilibrium price of the good to $P_2$
- To bring about process innovation, the government could incentivise private firms to engage in R&D by providing research grants
- Welfare effects and inequity explanation are similar to subsidies

## Measures to influence the income levels of low-income households
### Minimum wage
- ==A minimum wage is the minimum hourly rate of pay for labour enforced by law==
- This protects workers against unduly low pay, ensuring some basic standard of living for workers and a more equitable share of the fruits of progress for all who are employed and are in need of such protection
- The policy targets lower income workers, as their income rises, so will their ability to consumer more goods and services, improving equity of distribution
- For it to be effective, it must be set at a price above the market equilibrium price
- Workers are guaranteed a wage above the market equilibrium wage through rates set by the government
- There is an increase in quantity supplied to $0Q_s$ units and a fall in quantity demanded of labour to $0Q_D$ units, causing unemployment as there is excess labour (surplus)
- Those who remain in employment have their wage rates raised however, as each $0Q_D$ units of labour is paid $W_{MIN}$ per hour
![[Minimum wage.jpeg]]
### Income redistribution - Transfer payments to households
#### Transfer payments
- ==A transfer payment is any expenditure by the government in which it receives no goods and services in return==
- This is usually given to household in the form of direct cash payments
- Such payment involve the transfer of income from one group of individuals (taxpayers) to other groups of individuals in the form of welfare provisions such as social security benefits
- A government provides lump sum payments to directly boost the income or purchasing power of consumers
- This increases their to purchase goods and services, usually basic necessities
- Transfer payments are usually given out baed on certain criteria or profile of the receiver
- In Singapore, eligible households would have received a one-off  U-save rebate in addition to their regular GST voucher
#### Vouchers
- Vouchers are a form of in-kid transfers, which households can redeem for specific goods and services
- In America, they distribute food stamps
- Vouchers can be universal, or targeted specifically at the poor to address inequity
- Vouchers are preferred to direct cash payment as the ensure that the poor get what they need the most rather than having them squander the cash on vices such as alcohol and gambling
- But, the government may not necessarily know which goods and services the poor need the most due to imperfect information
---
- Providing vouchers especially hose with an expiration date, or providing transfer payments has an effect of increasing the consumers' ability to purchase goods, shifting the demand curve to the right from $D_1$ to $D_2$
- Consumers are now able to purchase more units of the good at each price level, thus improving equity as lower income households have greater access to the goods/ services
- This increases consumption of certain goods, such as education and healthcare, and may also improve the standard of living of lower income households
![[Vouchers inequity.jpeg]]

#### Welfare effects
- If the initial equilibrium output was allocative inefficient, then the government could use vouchers to increase output level to the allocative efficient level
- In the case of education, government intervention improves allocative efficiency, as the initial consumption is likely to be below the socially optimal level
- If the initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient, then the provision of vouches could result in a welfare loss
- Vouchers with an expiration date may lead to consumers to use the vouchers even if they do not need the good or service at that point
#### Welfare effects - Marginalist principle
- Assume that the initial equilibrium output $Q_1$ is allocative efficient
- Vouchers are now provided, which increases consumer's ability to afford goods, causing demand to increase, with the demand curve shifting rightwards to $D_1$
- The rise in demand causes the equilibrium price to increase to $P_2$ and output to rise to $Q_2$
- The voucher results in an increase in output of $Q_2 - Q_1$
- Since the new output $Q_2$ is larger than the socially optimal of $Q_1$, the market is now allocative inefficient
- Too much resources have been channelled to this production, resulting in a welfare loss of area $abc$
- For the additional $Q_2 - Q_1$ units, the increase in total benefit (Area under MSB) curve is lesser than the increase in social cos (Area under MSC curve)
### Income redistribution - direct taxation
- Direct taxes are taxes levied by the government directly on the income, wealth and profits of individuals and firms
- Includes corporate tax, where firms are taxed a percentage of their profits; and income tax, where income earners are taxed a percentage of their annual income
- All forms of taxes are ways to generate revenue, which would improve equity is used for redistributive policies
#### Progressive taxation
- ==A progressive tax is one that takes a larger percentage of income from the high income earners than it does from the low income earners==
- It helps to increase equity reducing the post-tax income of the rich and increasing the income of the poor when the tax revenue is redistributed in the form of transfer payments to lower income groups
- The government may implement progressive personal income tax, where the average tax rate increases with income
- The rich have to pay a higher proportion of their income in terms of their taxes as compared to the poor
- The government may also raise certain direct taxes (e.g. capital gains tax) which will affect the rich more
- Since the rich earn most of the capital gains, interests, and dividends because they own most of the companies or assets, such progressive taxation helps to increase equality of income distribution
#### Welfare effects 
##### Stifles work incentives
- Progressive  income taxes may cause a disincentive to work as the marginal return to work effort is reduced
- Such taxes may even cause skilled labour to relocate to countries with lower income taxes, causing the productive capacity of the economy (PPC shifts in)
- It may also result in productive inefficiency, because workers hold back on their maximum productivity, as any additional effort which may bring potential wage increases may bring potential wage increases that may be taxed more heavily
- This results in underemployment, the economy could move from operating on the PPC to a point within the PPC
##### Stifles investment incentives
- Progressive taxation shifts economic production away from capital goods (tools, infrastructure, training, research) towards consumption goods
- When the high income earners are faced with higher income tax rates levied on the interest they earn from saving they might be discouraged from saving
- The fall in saving results in a fall in supply of loanable funds, leading to a rise in interest rate, which in turn leads to a fall in investment
- This may impede economic growth and standard of living  in the long run
- PPC shifts inward over time
#### Wealth taxation
- Wealth taxes are taxes on capital gains, dividends and a net wealth tax on individuals
- But it is challenging to do so as wealth can be very mobile and can move away very easily to other countries with more competitive tax rate
- Singapore is imposing wealth tax through existing means on property and suing cars
- They not seem to address inequity directly but they generate additional revenue for the government to spend on subsidies and redistributive measures such as transfer payments
### Indirect taxation
- Indirect taxes are levied on the sale of goods and services (i.e. based on spending) - the producer or retailer has the legal responsibility to pay the tax to the government, but may pass the tax onto consumers
- This is usually done to discourage consumption or raise tax revenue
- With the imposition of an per unit indirect tax on a good, the supply of the food falls, causing the supply curve to shift left from $S_1$ to $S_2$
- This causes a shortage at the original price $P_1$, causing upward pressure on prices, until the new equilibrium is reached at $C$
- Equilibrium price rises from $P_1$ to $P_2$ and equilibrium quantity falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
- For each unit of the good, consumers pay a higher price at $P_2$ while producers receive a lower price $P_0$ for each unit of the good
- The indirect tax per unit is the distance $P_2 - P_0$ and the governments earns area $P_2cdP_0$ as tax revenue
- The amount of tax revenue collected will be significant if demand for the good is price inelastic, since the fall in equilibrium quantity is small
- The amount of tax revenue will be limited if the demand is price elastic since the fall in equilibrium quantity is still large
- The government can implement selective indirect tax on goods and services by cutting tax rates of goods and services that are consume relatively more by the poor and raising taxes on luxury goods to improve equity
![[indirect tax inequity.jpeg]]
#### Welfare effects - Marginalist principle
- Assuming that the initial equilibrium output $Q_1$ is allocative efficient 
- An indirect tax is now imposed, which adds to the marginal cost of production of the firms, causing supply to fall
- The supply curve shifts to the left form $S_1$ to $S_2$
- The fall in supply causes the equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and the equilibrium output to fall to $Q_2$, and $Q_1 - Q_2$ units are no longer produced in the market
- For the additional $Q_1 - Q_2$ units, the increase in total benefit (area under MSB curve) is greater than the increase in social cost
- This results in a net benefit to society of area $bcd$
- Since the tax has caused these $Q_1 - Q_2$ units to not be produced, the potential benefit from these units is not enjoyed by society, causing a loss in this net benefit (i.e a welfare loss) of area $bcd$
#### Welfare effects - Consumer and producer surplus
- An indirect tax is now imposed, which adds to the marginal cost of production of the firms, causing supply to fall
- The supply curve shifts to the left form $S_1$ to $S_2$
- The fall in supply causes the equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and the equilibrium output to fall to $Q_2$, and $Q_1 - Q_2$ units are no longer produced in the market
- Consumer surplus falls by area $P_2cbP_1$ while producer surplus falls by area $P_1bdP_0$
- The government's total tax revenue is the tax per unit x quantity sold = area $P_2cdP_0$
- The net loss of welfare to society = $P_2cbP_1 +. P_1bdP_0 - area P_2cdP_0 = cbd$
### Skills upgrading
- It improves the employability and potential productivity of workers, which improves income equality
- Education and skills training can enable lower income groups to escape the viscous cycle of inadequate education, poor training, low productivity and poor quality jobs with low wages
- With these upgraded skills, workers will be more likely to be able to enable industries with higher labour demand and command higher wages
- Skills upgrading results in increased productivity, which leads to a rise in demand for labour as workers are seen to be more valuable (as the contribute more to total revenue now)
- This increases the equilibrium wage rate without creating excess of supply of labour in the market
