## Taxes
- ==A tax on good and services is called an indirect tax, as producers are the ones with the legal responsibility to pay the taxes to the government, but may pass it on to consumers through a higher price==
- Taxes are implemented to raise tax revenue to finance government expenditure, or discourage consumption/ production of a particular good
### Production tax
- A tax on output can help to correct the problem of negative externalities due to air pollution in the production of petrochemicals
- This is to reduce consumption/ production to the socially optimal level
![[Production tax.jpeg]]
- The government could impose a per unit output tax equal to the marginal external cost (MEC) at the socially optimal output $Q*$
- This forces firms to internalise the external costs when making production decisions as the tax raises the producers' marginal private costs of production (MPC), causing supply to fall
- SS curve (MPC) will shift vertically upwards to $SS' (MPC')$ by the amount of MEC at $Q*$  
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEC accurately, the tax results in a fall in market equilibrium output form $Q$ to $Q*$ 
- This is because the fall in supply due to the indirect tax would lead to a shortage, which creates upwards pressure on price
- As the price of the good increases, quantity demanded falls while quantity supplied rises until quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied again at a lower $Q*$ units
- At the new market equilibrium output where SS' = DD coincides with a socially optimal $Q*$, where MSB = MSC, the welfare loss of area D will be eliminated and allocative efficiency is restored 
### Pollution tax
![[Pollution tax.jpeg]]
- A pollution tax is a compulsory levy imposed on producers where firms have to pay a government per unit of pollution generated
- This creates incentives for firms to reduce pollutants/ emissions
- With this tax, rational firms will choose to lower pollution if the marginal private benefit of lower pollution (which is avoiding having to pay the pollution tax) outweighs the marginal private cost of doing so (e.g. installing equipment to reduce emissions) shown by a rise form MPC to MPC'
- With the reduction of pollution emitted, the extent of the negative impact on third parties is reduce form MEC to MEC'
- This would result in a reduction of welfare loss from area D to area C, resulting in a more allocative efficient outcome
- If firms do choose the pay the tax, the cost of production will rise as profits decrease, and they will end up cutting back production (fall in SS)
- This will also lower the levels of pollution in society and result in a more efficient allocation of resources
## Subsidies
- ==A production subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, but not made in exchange for any goods or services==
- This helps to encourage more overall consumption/ production of a particular goods, or make a good more affordable for the poor
### Positive externality

![[subsidy.jpeg]]
- The government can pay firms a per unit output subsidy equal to MEB at socially optimal output $Q*$
- The $SS$ curve ($MPC$) will shift vertically downwards to $SS^1$ ($MPC'$), which leads to a fall in the price of the good/ service form P to $P^1$ 
- This lower price will incentivise consumers to increase their consumption towards the socially optimal level $Q*$, there by internalising the MEB to society
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEB accurately
- The subsidy results in a rise in output form $Q$ to $Q*$
- The new market equilibrium output where $SS' = DD$ coincides with the socially optimal output $Q*$ where $MSB = MSC$, causing the welfare loss of area A to be eliminated and allocative efficiency is resorted
- The government can vary the per unit subsidy according to the MEB, enabling the social optimal output level to be obtained
### Factor immobility
- The government can also subsidise the provision of training by private firms to encourage existing workers whose skill sets have become redundant to continuously upgrade their skills
- With the subsidies, the price of training courses would fall, leading to an increase in quantity demanded
- As workers are equipped with the latest skills, they can move easily into industries that are in demand, reducing occupational immobility
## Tradable permits
- ==Tradable permits are permits to pollute issued to firms by a government, and these permits to pollute can be traded in a market==
- The government first decides on the optimal level of pollution that is allowable, and once they have calculated the total allowable pollution, they can auction the corresponding number of permits to pollute directly to firms or distribute them for free
- This makes the policy a command approach
- After the initial allocation of permits, firms are free to buy and sell with each other, with the prices of permits being determined in the market by demand and supply forces
- This makes the policy also a market-oriented approach
- Firms that acquire the permits acquire the right to emit the given quantity of pollution
- Firms do not all face the same costs of reducing pollution, 
- Firms with high clean-up costs would wish to pollute above the initial quote of permits they were initially allocated
- They may buy from firms with low clean-up costs, which would rather pollute less than the quota assigned to them, so that they can sell their profit and earn revenue form it
- Some firms are incentivised to find cleaner methods of production to reduce their pollution, and will weight the cleanup costs against the permit costs
- The overall pollution level is reduced to the total allowable pollution, achieving an allocative efficient outcome
- They provide incentives for producers to swtich to cleaner methods of production, targeting the root cause of the problem
- They also allow for certainty of outcome in terms of the overall pollution level as the government first decides on the total allowable pollution and the corresponding number of permits to issue
## Grants/ Vouchers
- ==The government can give grants (a lump sum payment for a specific purpose) or vouchers (with expire) for consumers or producers to increase the consumption/ production of goods and services==
- These increase the consumers' ability to spend on the good/ service, increasing their demand for the good
- The subsidy results in a rise in output form $Q$ to $Q*$
- The new market equilibrium output where $SS' = DD$ coincides with the socially optimal output $Q*$ where $MSB = MSC$, causing the welfare loss of area A to be eliminated and allocative efficiency is resorted

## Direct provision
- Direct provision is when the government supplies the  good directly to consumers, taking on the role of the producers
- The objective is to maximise society's welfare
### Free direct provision (for public goods)
- The market fails to allocate resources to the production of public goods as private producers would not produce them due to a lack of effective demand in a free market
- This results in a missing market and hence the government must step in t ensure that public goods are produced at the socially desirable levels
- As the government is not profit-oriented, it does not need to earn revenue to cover the cost of production
- The direct provision of the goods can be financed through the that the government collects, and the public goods can be provided free of charge to consumers, allowing allocative efficiency to be achieved
### Direct provision of goods (positive externality)
- The government can also take over production of goods in cases where there are significant positive externalities like education and healthcare, and provide it to consumers for free or at a very low price
![[free direct provision.jpeg]]
- In the above case, the market output is when the price is zero at $Qf$ and the welfare loss of area CDE is incurred
- $Qf$ is closer to the socially optimal level of output, $Q*$ than $Q$ and a smaller welfare loss in incurred compared to the welfare loss of area $ABC$ when $Q$ was consumed
- However, there is also the possibility of creating greater welfare loss to society due to overconsumption (in cases where the MEB is not that large at the socially optimal level of output)
- The welfare loss (shaded area $CDE$) from the overconsumption will be larger than the initial welfare loss of $ABC$
- In such cases, the government can instead directly provide the good and change a low positive price for it
### Problems
- Funding the provision of public goods would cause the government to incur and opportunity cost as government funds used for public goods could have been spent on other areas
- Hence the government will need to consider the cost and benefits involved when deciding what goods to produce and how much to provide
- The lack of perfect information may result in the government under or over producing the good
- Private firms are profit-motivated and would hence have the incentive to produce their output at the least possible cost
- Unlike private firms, a government-owned firm target is largely to meet the output level targets set by the government
- It might lack the incentives to minimise cost, leading to productive inefficiency
- Outsourcing production to private firms is a variant of free direct provision
- Instead of being the producer, the government could merely provide the funding and outsource the production and maintenance of goods to private producers by giving them contracts
- These private producers are more efficient in minimising costs than the public sectors since cost has a direct effect on their profitability. eliminating the productive inefficiency associated with direct provision
- Joint provision is when the private and public sectors can producer a particular good or service together
- This seeks to address the demerits of the government taking over production completely
- The presence of the private sector creates competition for the government enterprise and improves productive efficiency
## Rules and regulations
- Regulation works by compelling consumers/ producers to change their behaviour (e.g. change the quantity consumed/ produced to the socially optimal quantity), or by reducing the extent of the externality to reduce the welfare loss to society
### Ban
- Bans are used when it very difficult to use other policies to limit the amount of the externalities generated, or when the damage caused is very severe
- A total ban could improve or worsen society's welfare, which would depend on the magnitude of the MEC
![[total ban.jpeg]]
- The socially optimal level of output is $Q*$ where MSB = MSC
- At the output of $Q*$ the net total social benefit (i.e. societal welfare) is area A
- Under the free market, the equilibrium output is $Q$ where DD= SS
- The negative externality causes a deadweight loss to to society of area B, but it will also lose the net total social benefit of A from consuming/producing $Q*$
- If the MEC was high such that the divergence between the MPC and MSC was large, resulting in area B > area A, a total ban will improve society's welfare
- But, this does not cause output to be at the socially optimal output level
- However, if area A > area B, it would be better to leave the market alone and let it produce at $Q$ 
- Thus, whether a ban is desirable or not depends on the extent of the negative externality
- When the MEC is very high, bans are usually able to lead to an improvement in society's welfare
### Quota
- A quota is a measure by which the government regulates the quantity of a good that can be offered for sale
![[quota.jpeg]]
- Initially at market equilibrium, the equilibrium price is at $P_1$ and the equilibrium quantity is at $Q_1$ 
- Suppose the government imposes a quote (Quantity control), fixing the quantity of the goods sold to $Q_2$
- The new supply curve is represented by the bold line in diagram 12, resulting in the new equilibrium price of $P_2$ and the quantity to $Q_2$ 
### Lemon law
- The government can pass laws to regulate the quality that producers have to meet
- The government can also enact laws and legislation such as the 'lemon law' 
- It forces sellers to replace or repair defective goods and allows buyer the right to a discount or refund if the repairs or replacements of the defective good are not possible or not provided within a reasonable time
- As there is now an avenue for buyers to 'punish' the sellers should the good be found defective, sellers are forced to be honest about the product quality
- Hence buyers would be more willing to pay higher prices for good quality products since they have greater assurance of the product quality
- This reduced the problem of adverse selection as buyer and sellers of good quality products can now engage in mutually advantageous trade based on an agreeable price
## Public education
- This provides information to consumers on the true marginal private benefits of consuming goods, addressing information failure
- This reduces the extent of information failure in the market and encourages consumers to consume more/ less of the goods as they improve their individual decision making
![[public education.jpeg]]
- With public education, consumers are aware of the true marginal private benefits of consuming the goods
- Hence consumers willingness to consume the good increases/ decreases, causing demand for the good to increase/ decrease to the true MPB curve ($DD'$)
- The new market equilibrium quantity matches the socially optima quantity to be consumed at $Q*$, resolving the allocative inefficiency problem
## Evaluation
### Imperfect information
- In order for market-oriented policies like taxes and subsides to effectively achieve the socially optimal level of output, the government needs to be able to determine accurately the optimal level of the tax or subsidy
- In the case of a tax/ subsidy, the government may not have perfect information on the MEB/ MEC at the socially optimal output
- In the case of tradable permits, the government may not have perfect information on the optimal total allowable pollution level
- For command policies like the direct provision of public goods, the government may not have perfect information on what is the socially optimal quantity to be produced
- However, having some quantity of the good being produced by the government is better than having non at all under the free market
- This may not apply to counties like Singapore, where the country is small and the method of obtaining information is efficient due to technologically advanced methods of data collection
### Price elasticity of demand
- A production tax has the effect of increasing the price of a good
- But if demadn for the good is price inelastic, the rise in price will cause quantity demanded to fall less than proportionately
- A higher tax is required to lower the quantity demand by enough to reach the socially optimal level
### Responsiveness of consumers/ producers to measure
- The effectiveness of education depends on consumers' responsiveness
- It may take a long period of time as it is hard to change existing mindsets, which consumers decisions are based on
- But, it is still necessary as it is the only way to solve information failure
### Cognitive biases
- Economic agents may not always make rational decisions as decision making can be affected by cognitive biases resulting in irrational decisions
- Governments can consider the cognitive biases of people when designing policies
#### Sunk cost fallacy
- Sunk costs are costs that already have been incurred by economic agents and cannot be recovered
- They are not considered during decision-making as they are irrelevant for both present and future economic decision, only the future benefits and costs matter
- The sunk cost fallacy is the human tendency to continue a behaviour as a result of previously invested resources whether or not the MC outweighs the MB
- For example, the cost of owning a car is expensive, and once a car has been purchased, these are sunk costs, and should not impact a drivers decision whether or not to drive to a location
- However, drivers in Singapore then to use their cars more often to make the price paid 'worthwhile' due to sunk cost fallacy
- This worsens congestion and increases car usage, the opposite of the goal of raising the cost of owning a car
- Drivers are also less responsive to a rise in ERP, since they have already invested so much into buying. car, making them reluctant to cut back on driving, reducing the effectiveness of the ERP
### Loss aversion
- This refers to the tendency of people to prefer avoiding a loss over making an equivalent or equal gain
- Taxing the use of plastic bags is more effective than subsidising the use of alternatives as consumers tend to avoid losses
- The pain of losing is two times stronger than the pleasure of gaining
### Saliency bias
- Saliency bias refers tot the tendency for people to focus on information that is more prominent and ignore other less prominent but equally relevant pieces of information
- This causes economic agents to overestimate the likelihood of events that come easily to mine, skewing the weighting of benefits and costs when making decisions
- For example, when the government wants tot tackle sugar consumption, They are more likely to be successful if it were to focus on how sugar can help weight loss than how it can help prevent diabetes
- obesity is amore visible problem compared to other health issues such as diabetes
### Targeting the root cause of the problem
- Pollution tax and tradable permits are more effective than a production tax as it targets the root cause of the problem
- A production tax reduces the amount of negative externalities indirectly by reducing the quantity of goods produced/ consumed, producers do not have any incentives to develop methods to lower incentives
- Pollution tax will give firms the incentives to find cleaner production methods or engage in R&D that allows them to reduce the amount of tax it needs to pay, reducing pollution
### Unintended consequences
- Taxes on goods and services increase the MPC, thus reducing supply and leading to a rise in the price of the good
- If the good is a necessity, it may have a particularly negative impact on low income households
- This is because it is less affordable for them a, causing them to be rationed out of the energy market
- Since it is a necessity, it leads to a new problem of inequity, where there is unfair distribution of the good since only the rich who have a higher ability to pay for it will be able to afford it
- Subsidies, grants and vouchers for necessities will benefit poor households in particular as the subsidy causes the good to become cheaper, enabling more lower income households to afford the good/service
### Long-term sustainability
- Whether or not these policies are sustainable in the long run depends on the cost of of implement
- For regulations to be effective, the government must have the recourses and capability to ensure compliance by consumers and firms
- But, this may be difficult in large countries where it is difficult to monitor every area effectively and monitoring costs will be high
- Taxes on goods with price inelastic demand generates a lot of tax revenue as the tax will lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded, and can be sued to finance alternative measures and implementation costs
- Direct provision of goods and services, subsidies, grants and vouchers require the use of government funds to finance, and may incur opportunity cost
  The government may also run a budget deficit, which is not sustainable in the long run
### Cost efficiency
- A policy is cost efficient if it is the least cost method to solve the market failure problem
