- ==Externality: Positive/ Negative impact on a 3rd party not involved in the consumption/ production of a good or service==
## Positive externality
- Point out source of externality
	- Vaccines -> Individuals lower likelihood of being infected, people around them less likely to fall ill as well, even though they never consume
	- R&D -> One firm creates new idea/ product/ process, other firms benefit by copying/ adapting/ building on this innovation -> Higher profits
	- Enjoy a positive externality in consumption/ production of vaccines/ R&D
- Divergence
	- Positive externality causes MSB to be grater than MPB, since MSB includes additional benefits to third parties not involved in consumption/ production and the private benefits to individuals/ firms consuming/ producing the good
	- MSB curve is higher than MPB curve, where MEB is the vertical distance between MSB and MPB curve
- Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- Under free market, consumers/ producers base their consumption decisions on their MPB, and disregard external benefits.
	- Assuming no negative externalities, MPC = MSC
	- Market equilibrium output is when  Demand = Supply, where market equilibrium output = Q and market equilibrium price is P
	- Socially optimal output is at Q* and P*, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
- Allocative efficiency
	- Since Q* > Q, there is underproduction/ consumption of the good, resulting in deadweight loss
- Deadweight loss
	- For Q* to Q units, the MSB is greater than MSC, there is a gain to society's welfare if Q* - Q units of the good is consumed/ produced
	- Deadweight loss is equal to area A, as the total social benefit is equal to area A + B, while total social cost is equal to area B

## Negative externality
- Point out source of externality
	- Cigarettes -> When a person smokes a cigarette, the smoker incurs the cost of the price of the cigarettes, but other people in the vicinity inhale the second-hand smoke and have health problems and potentially incur higher healthcare costs
	- Productions of electricity using coal -> When electricity is produced, the firm has to pay for factors or production such as coal and wages in their productions process, but the production causes air pollution, which can cause health problems for third parties as they inhale the smoke, incurring higher healthcare costs
- Divergence
	- Negative externality causes MSC to be grater than MPC, since MSC includes additional costs to third parties not involved in consumption/ production and the private costs to individuals/ firms consuming/ producing the good
	- MSC curve is higher than MPC curve, where MEC is the vertical distance between MSC and MPC curve
- Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- Under free market, consumers/ producers base their consumption decisions on their MPC, and disregard external costs.
	- Assuming no positive externalities, MPB = MSB
	- Market equilibrium output is when Demand = Supply, where market equilibrium output = Q and market equilibrium price is P
	- Socially optimal output is at Q* and P*, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
- Allocative efficiency
	- Since Q > Q*, there is overproduction/ consumption of the good, resulting in deadweight loss
- Deadweight loss
	- For Q* to Q units, the MSC is greater than MSB, there is a loss to society's welfare if Q -\*Q units of the good is consumed/ produced
	- Deadweight loss is equal to area D, as the total social benefit is equal to area E, while total social cost is equal to area D+E

## Imperfect information
- ==Occurs when potential buyers/ seller have incomplete/ inaccurate/ uncertain/ limited info, causing then to possibly make 'wrong' choices, leading to market failure==
### Consumer ignorance
#### Underestimation of true private benefits
- Point out sources of externality
	- Preventive healthcare  - e.g. health screening can help reduced the likelihood of future health complications in the future
	- R&D -  Firms creates new idea/ product/ process, helping to reduce marginal cost of production as technology makes production more efficient, increasing profits
	- Due to imperfect info, consumers/ producers may be ignorant about these long-term gains and under-estimate the true benefits that consuming/ producing the good provides
- Divergence
	- The under-estimation of benefits by consumer/ producer causes the perceived  MPB to be lower than the true MPB
	- Consumers/ producers would base their consumption/ production decisions on their perceived MPB, and the perceived MPB curve is equal to the market demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as True MPB, while the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- The socially optimal output is at Q*, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
	- The market equilibrium output is at Q, where Demand = Supply
- Allocative efficiency
	-  Since Q* > Q, there is underproduction/ consumption of the good, resulting in deadweight loss
- Deadweight loss
	- For Q* to Q units, the MSB is greater than MSC, there is a gain to society's welfare if Q* - Q units of the good is consumed/ produced
	- Deadweight loss is equal to area M, as the total social benefit is equal to area M + N, while total social cost is equal to area N

![[Imperfect info benefits.png]]
#### Overestimation of true private benefits
- Point out sources of externality
	- Smoking - long term harm to ones health and well-being, health complications such as lung cancer
	- Due to imperfect info, consumers/ producers may be ignorant about these long-term costs and over-estimate the true benefits that consuming/ producing the good provides
- Divergence
	- The over-estimation of benefits by consumer/ producer causes the perceived  MPB to be higher than the true MPB
	- Consumers/ producers would base their consumption/ production decisions on their perceived MPB, and the perceived MPB curve is equal to the market demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as True MPB, while the  MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- The socially optimal output is at Q*, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
	- The market equilibrium output is at Q, where Demand = Supply
- Allocative efficiency
	- Since Q > Q*, there is overproduction/ consumption of the good, resulting in deadweight loss
- Deadweight loss
	- For Q* to Q units, the MSC is greater than MSB, there is a loss to society's welfare if Q - \*Q units of the good is consumed/ produced
	- Deadweight loss is equal to area A, as the total social benefit is equal to area B, while total social cost is equal to area A + B

## Asymmetric info
- ==Asymmetric info is when one side of the market has better information than the other, resulting in a distortion of incentives and inefficient market outcomes==
#### Adverse selection (Sellers)
- ==Adverse selection is a situation in which asymmetric information between consumers and producers results in an unfavourable selection of products/ buyers in a market, which leads to a missing market==
- Happens before the transaction is completed
- A 'lemon' is a poor quality product, e.g. a second-hand car that needs frequent repairs
- There is asymmetric info in the second-hand car market; the seller (owner of used car) knows more about the quality of the cars thy are selling than the buyers
- The price offered by buyers in the second-hand car market is based on whether they think they are being sold a high or low quality car
	- A typical buyer is willing to pay a high price if he knows the used car is of high-quality, while if he knows the car if of low-quality, he will be willing to pay a low price.
- The price that sellers are willing to accept is based on the quality of the car known to them
	- A seller of high-quality car is only willing to sell it if he is offered a high price, while for a low-quality used car, he is prepared to accept a low price
- Consumers know that are low quality cars for sale but don't know which car is of low quality
	- If they assume that half the cars are of high quality and half are of low quality, they will be prepared to only offer an average price for a car
	- Sellers of high quality cars are not prepared to accept this average price, and will not offer their cars for sale and leave the market
	- Sellers of low quality cars are willing to sell their cars at the average price and will join the market
- As the quality of cars on offer slowly deteriorate, the average price consumers are willing to offer will fall
	- More and more sellers of high quality cars will leave the market, and the market will be dominated by 'lemons', in a phenomenon known as the adverse selection problem
- In the extreme case, all the cars sold and purchased in the used-car market are lemons, and the market for 'cherries' disappears, resulting in a missing market
	- Consumers who desire to buy the 'cherries' and producers who desire to sell the 'cherries' will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of good quality cars, where willing buyers and sellers are matched in the market
	- However, since the better quality produces are driven out of the market by low quality products due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit to society from having some good quality products traded is lost, and society's welfare is not maximised -> allocative inefficiency
#### Adverse selection (Buyers)
- There is asymmetric info in the insurance market; A person who buys a health insurance policy knows much more about his risks and needs for insurance more than the firm
- There are two types of customers, high-cost customers with high medical expenses and low- cost customers with low medical expenses
- The price that firms are willing to sell insurance at is based on whether they think the customer is a high-cost customer or a low-cost customer
	- A typical firm is willing to sell insurance at a low price if they know the customer is a  low-cost customer, while if they know the customer is a high-cost customer, they are willing to sell insurance at a high price
- The price that buyers are willing to accept is based on the cost of the medical expenses known to them
	- A high-cost customer is prepared to accept a high price, while a low-cost customer is only willing to buy it at a low price
- The insurance company cannot distinguish between high-cost and low-cost customers, but it must charge a price for its insurance coverage
	- If it assumes that half its customers are half high-cost and half low-cost, it will offer coverage at a price equal tot he average cost of providing the insurance coverage
	- Low cost customers are not prepared to pay the average price, and drop out of the insurance market
	- High cost customers are willing to pay the average price and will join the market
- With increasingly more high-cost customers buying insurance, the average cost of insurance companies rises and the average price that insurance companies charge rises
	- More and more low-cost customers will leave the market and the market will increasingly be dominated by high-cost customers
- In the extreme case, only high-cost customers are left in the insurance market, and the market for insurance for low-cost customers disappears, resulting in a missing market
	- Low cost customers who desire to buy the good and producers who desire to sell the good to low-cost customers will not be able to do so
- The socially optimal outcome is to have some sales of insurance to low-cost customers, where willing buyers and sellers are matched in the market
	- However, since the low-cost customers are driven out by the high cost customers due to asymmetric information, the potential net benefit to society from having some low cost customers is lost, and society's welfare is not maximised -> allocative inefficiency
#### Moral hazard
- ==Moral hazard is when economic agents take greater risks. act less carefully than they normally would because the resulting costs will not be borne by them==
- Moral hazard happens after the transaction is completed, whe2n the party that is insured can affect the probability/ magnitude of the event that triggers payment
- Moral hazard can arise when a party to a contract changes their behaviour as a consequence of the contract
- For example, insurance may cause people to take greater risks because they know part of the costs of undesirable outcomes of taking risks will be borne by insurance companies
	- A person who bought home insurance for theft may become very casual about locking the doors to their house.
	- This changes the risk the insurance company thought they were taking based on the person's history of no burglary
- When the insured party takes action not observed by the insurer (no info that increases the probability of the event that triggers payment), it will drive up the insurer's cost to the point that the business is no longer profitable
	- The service will no longer be provided since there is insufficient profit to offer it on sale, and there will be a missing market
- It can also lead to a principal agent problem, where one person (agent) is performing some tasks on behalf of another (principal)
	- If the actions of the agent cannot be perfectly monitored, the agent tends to undertake more risk or put in lesser effort than what is desired by the principal
	- A worker, an agent for an employer, the principal, might shirk his responsibilities if the boss is not looking, resulting in less than desirable results
- Moral hazard creates a lack of trust between potential buyers and sellers for a products
	- Mutually advantageous trade might not take palace, and thus there is no market for it
	- There is market failure as the potential net benefit to society from having these goods trades is lost, and society's welfare is not maximised -> allocative inefficiency
#### Supplier-induced demand
- If a producers has more information than the consumer, a situation of supplier-induced demand may arise where consumers end up buying more goods/ servicers than what is optimal for them
- Point out source of market faliure
	- For example, a doctor (seller) may know more about the health of a patient and the relevance of treatments/ health checks than the patient (buyer) does
	- Lacking expertise, the patients are likely to listen to the doctors for advice when deciding how much healthcare services to consumer
	- Profit-motivated doctors may lead patients to believe that certain non-essential healthcare services or test are required
- Divergence
	- This causes the patient's perceived MPB to be higher than the true MPB
	- Consumers/ producers would base their consumption/ production decisions on their perceived MPB, and the perceived MPB curve is equal to the market demand curve
	- Assuming no externalities, the MSB curve will be the same as True MPB, while the MSC curve is the same as the MPC curve, which is also the supply curve
- Social equilibrium/ Market equilibrium
	- The socially optimal output is at Q*, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised
	- The market equilibrium output is at Q, where Demand = Supply
- Allocative efficiency
	- Since Q > Q*, there is overproduction/ consumption of the good, resulting in deadweight loss
- Deadweight loss
	- For Q* to Q units, the MSC is greater than MSB, there is a loss to society's welfare if Q - \*Q units of the good is consumed/ produced
	- Deadweight loss is equal to area A, as the total social benefit is equal to area B, while total social cost is equal to area A + B
