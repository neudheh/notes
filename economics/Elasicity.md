# Income elasticity of demand (YED)
- ==Income elasticity of demand measured the responsiveness of a demand to a change in income, ceteris paribus==
- It is measured by the percentage change in demand for a good resulting in a percentage change in income
- It determines the direction and magnitude of a shift in demand given a change in income, assuming all other factors remain unchanged
- Formula:
$$YED = \frac{percentage\ change\ in\ demand}{percentage\ change\ in\ income}$$
## Interpretation
- To interpret YED values, we need to consider the sign and magnitude
- Normal goods have a positive YED value as when peoples income increases, the demand for normal goods increases
- Inferior goods have a negative YED value as when peoples income increases, the demand for inferior goods decreases

|Value of YED|Types of goods|Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative: YED < 0| Inferior goods (typically cheaper alternatives): E.g. Second-hand clothes | Increase in income leads to a fall in demand, and vice versa|
|Positive: 0 < YED< 1|Normal (Necessity): E.g. Rice, Bread| Increase in income leads to a **less then proportionate** increase in demand, and vice-versa, meaning the demand is income inelastic|
|Positive: YED > 1| Normal (Luxury): E.g. Sports car| Increase in income leads to a **more than proportionate** increase in demand, and vice-versa, meaning that demand is income elastic|

## Factors affecting YED
### Degree of necessity
- Necessities have a low income elasticity of demand of 0< YED< 1 (i.e. As peoples incomes change, the demand for basic necessities changes less than proportionately)
	- This is because we have a limited need to consume more or less of basic or necessity goods as our income changed
	- This is especially so if we have been consuming sufficient quantities already
- Luxuries have a high income elasticity of demand  YED> 1 (i.e. As people incomes changes, the demand for luxuries changes more than proportionately)
	- This is because they are items we can do without during periods of falling income
	- A rise in income will give consumer the confidence go ahead with "big-ticket" items such as sports cars and overseas holidays to exotic places
	- A fall in income will cause households to cut back on these non-essential items and demand will fall more than proportionately
### Changing perception of the good due to income level of consumers
- The income elasticity of a good may differ for consumers at income levels
- A good can be considered as a normal good at low income levels, but the same good may be regarded as an inferior good at higher income levels
- When income rises from an initially low level, the demand for the good rises and it is considered a normal good.
	- People still buy them as they cannot afford the more desirable substitutes
	- The good is a necessity
- At higher income levels, these substitutes become more affordable, and demand for the earlier good will fall as people switch to more desirable substitutes
	- The earlier good is now a inferior good
# Cross-price elasticity of demand (XED)
- ==Cross price elasticity of demand (XED) measures the responsiveness of demand for one good to a change in the price of another good, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in the demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of another good
- Formula:
$$XED_{AB}= \frac{percentage\ change\ in\ demand\ for\
good\ A}{percentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ good\ B }$$
## Interpretation
- To interpret XED values, we need to consider both the sign and magnitude
- The negative/ positive sign of the coefficient shows the type of relationship between the two goods

|Sign of $XED_{AB}$|Relationship between goods A and B| Explanation|
|-|-|-|
|Negative ($XED_{AB}$ < 0)| Complementary goods e.g. bread and butter| If price of good B (bread) rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, and lesser of good A (butter), a complement of B will be demanded. If the change in demand for good A and change in price of good B are in opposite directions, the sign will be negative according to the formula|
|Positive ($XED_{AB}$ > 0)| Substitute goods e.g. butter and margarine | If the price of good B (butter) rises, quantity demanded of good B falls and more of good A (margarine), a substitute good, will be demanded. If the change in dmeand for good A and the chaneg in price of good B are in the same direction, the sign will be positive according to the formula|
- The magnitude of the XED values shows the degree of closeness for substitutes and complementary goods
- Goods that are close substitutes or complements have high XED values
## Factors affecting XED
### Closeness of substitutes
- The main determinant of the magnitude for cross price elasticity of demand is the closeness of the substitute or complement of the two goods
- The closer the relationship between these two goods, the larger will be the effect on the demand for a good given a change in the price of the related good
- Close substitutes must be in the same price range
- The cross price elasticity of demand for good A with respect to the price of good B may not be the same for the other way around
	- This may be because of the different price range of the two goods
# Price elasticity of demand (PED)
- ==Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantitiy demanded for the good to change in its price, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in quanitity demanded for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of that good
- When price changes with all other non-price factors remaining constat, price elasticity of demand will measure how much quantitiy demanded will change
- Formula
$$ PED = \frac{percentage\ change\ in\ quantity\ demanded\ of\ a\ good}{percentage\ change\ in\ price\ of\ a\ good}$$

## Interpretation
- PED is absolute to take in account the inverse realtionship due to the [[Demand and Supply#Law of demand|Law of demand]]

|Value of PED| Explanation|
|-|-|
|Perfectly price inelastic demand \|PED\| = 0$| For a given percentage fall in price, the quantity demanded for the good remains the same (i.e. Consumers have no choice but to buy the good). The demand for the good is said to be perfectly price inelastic|
|Price Inelastic Demand 0 < \|PED\| < 1 | When a given percentage rise in price brings aabout a **less then proportionate** fall in quantitiy demanded and vice versa, the demand for the good is said to be price inelastic|
|Price Elastic Demand \|PED\| > 1| When a given percentage rise in price brings about a **more than proportionate** fall in quantitiy demanded and vice versa, the demand for the good is said to be price elastic|
|Perfectly price elastic demand \|PED\| = âˆž|  At the given price, quantitiy demanded is finiftely large. Any increase in price will cause quantitiy demanded to drop to zero. The demand for the good is said to be perfectly price elastic|

## Factors affecting PED
### Number and closeness of available substitutes
- The more numerous and closer the substitutes, the more price elastic the demand foer the good
#### The number of substitutes
- An increase in the price of a good causes its substitutes to become realtively cheaper
- If there are numerous substitutes, a percentage increase in price tends ot lead to a larger percentage fall in quantity demanded for that good becuase consumers can easily switch to other substitutes
#### Closeness of substitutes
- Defenition of the good
	- Depends on how widely or narrowly the good is defined
	- The demand for narrowly defined goods (nescafe coffee) / services will be price elastic as there are many close substitutes available
	- Demand for goods that are widely defined (meat or food)/ services will be price inelastic as there are very few close substitutes available
- Price range
	- Close substitiutes must also be in the same price range
	- The smaller the price difference, the closer the substitutes
- Advertising
	- Sucessful advertising raises demand by bringing the product to more people's attention and increases people's desire for it
	- It also reduces the price elasticity of demand for the good (i.e. it becomre more price inelastic) becuase it creates greater brand loyalty
	- Consumers percieve competitors brands as poor substitutes
	- This allows the firm to raise its price above that of its rivals with no signigficant fall in sales (quantity sold)
### Proportion of income spent on the good
- The larger the proportion of the consumers' income (budget) the good takes up, the greater the price elasticity of deamdn
- When the prices of such goods rises, consumers' ability to afford them is lowered more significantly, and so quantitiy dmeanded for these goods will fall more than proportionately
### Degree of necessity
- A necessity good/ service is one that consumers will buy regardelss of the change in their income
- The more necessary a good or service is, the lower the change in the quanitity demanded when there is a change in price, thust the lower its price elasticity of demand
### Habit-forming nature of good
- When a product is habit-forming, such as addicitve goods like alcohol and tobacco, other goods become poor substitutes
- For a heavy drinker who is addicted to alcohol, when the price of alcohol rises, the quanitity demanded will not fall as much
- This is becuase they are addicted to alcohol and veiw other substitues as poor substitiues
- Habit-forming goods tend to be price inelastic
### Time period (for consumers to find substitiutes)
- Demand will be more price elastic in the long run than in the short run
- Time is needed for consumers to find sustainable substitues after a price change and to alter their expenditure patterns
- Imperfect knowledge about price changes in the short run
	- Consumers do not have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices at all times
	- Consumers may be unaware of the price changes initially, but when time passes, consumer will be able to respond to the rise in price by relocating their expenditure form one good to relatively cheaper goods
