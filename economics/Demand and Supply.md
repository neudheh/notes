# Price mechanisms and its functions
## Features of a free market economy
- The government is not involved in resource allocation
- Households and firms are free to pursue their self-interests
- Households aim to maximise their net benefits while firms seek to maximise their total profits
- Households have the freedom of choice of what to consume and how much to consume
- All resources are owned by households (e.g. capital and labour) and can decide how many resources they wish to supply
- There is free enterprise and competition
- All production is undertaken by firms and they can decide what to produce, how much to produce and how to produce
- Firms, being profit motivated, will produce those goods to meet the preferences of the consumers, only if it is profitable
- Consumers and firms make their consumption and production decisions independent of each other, but they come to a consensus on price and quantities of goods and services
- ==The price mechanism refers to the coordinating mechanism by which the independent decision of consumers and producers result in the allocation of scarce resources in the market economy==
## Resource allocation in a free market
- The scarcity of resources required us to make choices in terms of resource allocation, causing us to answer the three basic economic questions
	- What and how much to produce? - The combinations of goods and services to produce
	- How to produce - The method of production to use (more labour or capital intensive?)
	- For whom to produce? - How the output produced is distributed and who gets to consume the goods/ services produce
- In a free market, the price mechanism through its signalling, incentive and rationing functions addresses these questions
- The price mechanism signals when to stop/ start producing goods
	- Good A goes out of fashion -> Existing producers will be unable to sell -> Prices fall -> Other producers see the lower prices -> Will not produce -> Instead produces a newer good that fetches a higher price
- The price mechanisms rations limited resources for consumers
	- Prices mean we cannot afford everything -> Goods are rationed and only those who are able to buy will have it
- The price mechanism provide incentives for producers to allocate scarce resources (Factors of Production)
	- E.g. price of good increases -> Producers will allocate more resources to the good to earn more profits
# Demand
- ==Demand for a good or service refers to the quantity of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy at various prices, in a given time period==
- Demand in economics is usually referred to as effective demand - when consumers are both willing and able to pay for the goods and services required
## Law of demand
- ==The law of demand states that there is an inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus==
### Law of diminishing marginal utility
- The law of diminishing marginal utility can be used to explain the law of demand
- Total utility is the total satisfaction a person derives from from consuming a given amount of good in a period of time
- Marginal utility is defined as the additional satisfaction derived from consuming an additional unit of the good in a period of time
- ==The law of diminishing marginal utility states that beyond a certain level of consumption, as more and more units of a good are being consumed, the marginal utility a consumer derives from successive units decreases, assuming each unit is constant and ceteris paribus==
### Consumer decision making
- Consumers will maximise their net total utility by applying the marginalist principle
![[Central Problem of Economics#Marginalist principle]]
- Marginal benefits is the same as marginal utility, while Marginal cost is equal to the price
- When P = MU, they are at the point of consumer equilibrium, where there is no tendency for the consumer to consume one more or less unit of the good as he has maximised net total utility
- If P < MU, consumers will derive greater net benefits from buying additional units of the good since the addition to total benefits exceeds the addition to total cost
- If P > MU, it is rational for consumers to cut back on consumtion of the good since reducing the amount consumer will lower total benefits by less than total costs, thus increaseing net total utility
- MU reflects the maximum price consumers are willing to pay for the good
## Demand schedule
- An individual demand schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus of one consumer
- A market demand schedule is the sum of all of the quantity demanded by each consumer at each price level
- It shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded for all consumers, ceteris paribus
## Demand curve
- The demand schedule can be transformed into a demand curve
- The market demand curve is the summing up horizontally the demand curves of each consumers at each price
- Therefore the market demand curve is the horizontal summation of the individual demand curves of all the consumers in the market
- It shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded for all consumers, ceteris paribus
- Economists are more concerned with market demand than individual demand because firms sell to many customers and not just one
- The term demand curve is used when the graph is a straight line still as economists use straight lines instead of curves to simply economic analysis
- Demand is analysed over a periods of time as it a flow concept
- A change in price would cause a change in the quantity demanded according to the law of demand
	- This is reflected as a shift in the point along the demand curve
- A change in a non-price factor in demand would cause the quantity demanded at every price (i.e. demand) to increase 
	- This is reflected by all points on the demand curve to shift to the right if there is an increase in demand and vice versa
- Price affects quantity demanded, other factors affect demand
- ==Demand is not the same as quantity demanded==
## Factors affecting demand curve
### Changes in level of income
- As people incomes rises, their purchasing power increases and demand for normal goods such as smartphones increases
- As people incomes rises, their purchasing power increases and they will buy lesser inferior goods, and demand for inferior goods decreases
### Changes in price or availability of related goods
#### Price
- Substitute goods 
	- are goods that are in competitive demand (i.e. they satisfy the same need and may replace each other in use or consumption) such as Coke and Pepsi
	- If goods X and Y are substitutes, a rise in the price of X -> fall in the quantity demanded for X -> Rise in the demand of Y, which is relatively cheaper
- Complementary goods
	- are goods that are in joint demand (i.e. they are consumed together to satisfy a specific need/ want) such as printers and ink
	- If goods X and Y are complementary goods, a rise in the price of X (complementary good) -> fall in quantity demanded for X -> Fall in quantity demanded for Y (good in joint demand)
#### Availability
- Substitute goods
	- An increase in the availability of substitutes will lead to a decrease in the demand for the good that is in competitive demand and vice-versa
	- E.g. Increase availability of Netflix provides alternative platforms for consumers to watch TV, hence this will likely lead to a decrease in demand for cable
- Complementary goods
	- An increase in the availability of complementary goods will lead to an increase in demand for a good that is in joint demand and vice versa
	- E.g. If more camera models using SD cards are available, the demand for SD cards will increase as a result
#### Demand
- Derived demand
	- Derived demand is when the good/ service is not demand for its own sake, but to be used in the process for another good
	- In other words, the demand for factors of productions is derived from the demand for other goods
	- For example, we need wood to make houses, hence the demand from wood is derived from the demand for houses
	- When there is an increase in the demand of the final good, there will be an increase in demand for the good in derived demand
### Expectations of future price changes
- If people expect prices of a good to rise significantly in the near future, they are likely to buy more now before the price increase sets in, therefore current demand for the good increases
- This is especially so for goods which people can bring forward for purchase such as cars and houses
- However, this can depend if the good can be stored or if it is perishable
### Change in taste and preferences
- When there is a change in tastes and preferences, people will prefer the good compared to other goods as it is healthier/ more trendy, and are more willing to pay for the good, hence they will demand the good at every given price
- This can be affected by changes in advertising, fashion, new information through hearsay or the press
### Changes in government policies
- Government policies in the form of legislation, may change the demand for specific goods and services
- This applies to only partial bans, restrictions and outright bans
- E.g. Anti-smoking laws -> Reduced demand for cigarettes 
- But, it can also be positive such as budling new bike paths -> Island is now more connected and safer to cycle -> More people cycle -> increased demand for bikes
- Theoretically this cannot be a factor in the free market, but most economies are mixed economies in reality rather than completely free from government intervention
### Changes in interest rates or availability of credit
- This only applies to large purchases people have to take loans for such as cars and houses
#### Interest rate
- Interest rate refers to the cost of borrowing money from banks
- When the interest rate is reduced, loans are now cheaper -> Consumers more likely to borrow money to finance purchase of consumer durables (cars, houses) 
	- Because cost of purchase has fallen even though prices of goods remain unchanged -> Consumers who borrowed money have increased ability to buy the goods
#### Availability of credit
- During an economic downturn, the economy may not be doing so well
- Banks may be scared over the higher risk of defaulting (People that borrow money may not be able to return it)
- They hence may stop or slow lending of funds to businesses or individuals -> Households are unable to obtain loans to buy big ticket items such as cars -> Decrease in demand for these goods
### Change in population/ population structure
- Changes in demography refers to a change in population size and structure
- If the population size were to change, there will be an increase in demand for most goods and services assuming purchasing power per person does not decline as a result of the population increase
- If the population structure were to change, such as an aging population, there will be a larger proportion of the elderly and a smaller proportion of the young, hence the demands for goods and and services consumed by the elderly (healthcare, wheelchairs) will increase
	- Goods consumed by the youth will decrease

# Supply
- ==Supply is the willingness and ability of a firm to offer a good for sale at various prices in a given time period==
- ==The law of supply states that there is a direct/ positive relationship between price and quantity supplied, ceteris paribus==
## Supply schedule
- The supply schedule is similar to the demand schedule
- An individual supply schedule shows the relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus of one supplier
- A market supply schedule is the sum of all of the quantity supplied by each firm at each price level
- It shows the relationship between price and quantity supplied for all suppliers, ceteris paribus
## Supply curve
- The supply schedule can also be represented graphically as a supply curve
- It is the horizontal summation of the quantity supplied at every price point for each supplier
- The market supply curve is the summing up horizontally the demand curves of each consumers at each price
- If there is a change in price, the quantity supplied will change
	- This is reflected as a movement in the point along the demand curve
- If there is a change in a non-price factor, the quantity supplied at every price point will change (i.e. supply)
	- An increase in supply is reflected as a rightward shift in the supply curve and vice-versa
## Factors affecting the supply curve
### Changes in the marginal cost of production
- An increase in the marginal cost of production will reduce supply can cause a leftwards shift in the supply firm
- An increase in the marginal cost of production lowers total profits for the firm, causing firms to be less willing to supply the good at every price level and supply of the good falls
#### Price of factor inputs
- Prices of factor inputs will determine the production costs and hence, profits earned
- If wages, raw material prices or utility prices were to rise, the marginal cost of production will rise, hence firms will be less willing the supply the good at every price level -> supply falls
#### Change in technology that improves production process
- Technological advances enable production processes to become more automated and efficient with lesser need for factors of productions such as labour
- This lowers the marginal cost of production as more goods can be produced at a smaller cost,  making firms more willing to supply more at every price level -> supply rises
#### Changes in government policy
- Theoretically this cannot be a factor in the free market, but most economies are mixed economies in reality rather than completely free from government intervention
- Regulations
	- A fall in the foreign labour quota (number of foreign labour that can be employed) to 40%, will mean that the firm will have to hire  more local workers which command higher wages, causing marginal costs to rise
	- The marginal cost of production  rises, hence firms will be less willing the supply the good at every price level -> supply falls
- Taxes
	- An increase in an indirect tax (levy imposed on the sale of goods/ services) increases the marginal cost of production (e.g. GST rising form 7% to 9%)
	- The marginal cost of production  rises, hence firms will be less willing the supply the good at every price level -> supply falls
- Subsidies
	- A subsidy given to producers on the sale of each unit of a good offsets the marginal cost of production
	- This lowers the marginal cost of production as more goods can be produced at a smaller cost,  making firms more willing to supply more at every price level -> supply rises
### Changes in the production or price of related goods
#### Production of related goods
- Joint supply
	- Goods in joint supply are when one good is produced, another good is being produced at the same time as a by-product
	- For example, Diesel and Kerosene are by-products in the refinement of crude oil to produce petrol
	- A rise in the supply of a good will cause a rise in the supply of goods in join demand
- Competitive supply
	- Goods in competitive supply are goods that require similar factors of production
	- For example, both apples and oranges need land to grow
	- If there is a rise in supply of apples, the supply of oranges falls because farmers are devoting more land to apples and lesser for orange productions
#### Price of related goods
- Joint supply
	- When the price of a good rises, the quantity supplied of the good will rise, and the supply of goods that are in joint supply will rise since production for the main good has increased
- Competitive supply
	- When the price of a good rises, firms see that good as more profitable, and hence will switch production away from goods in competitive supply, leading to a fall in supply of goods that are in competitive supply
### Changes in expectation of future price changes
- If a price of a good is expected to rise, producers may temporarily hold back the amount they sell currently
- They are likely to build up their stocks in order to sell them at higher prices in the future to enjoy higher profit margins -> current supply of the good falls
- However, this can depend if the good can be stored or if it is perishable
### Nature, random shocks and other unpredictable events
- Adverse weather conditions will cause the destruction of crops, greatly reducing agricultural output, leading to a fall in producers' ability to supply these crops
- Wars and disaster can kill many people who are also workers, destroy buildings and machinery which will disrupt production, which would reduce producers' ability to supply
- Events such as an strike will disrupt production, which would reduce producers' ability to supply
### Change in the number of sellers or firms
- Market supply is made up of the supply of individual firms in the market
- In the short run, if the price of a good increases, existing firms in the short run will react by increasing quantity supplied
- In the long run, new firms are attracted by the profitability of the good, and will enter the industry, increasing the number of sellers in the industry, increasing the ability to supply the good, increasing market supply
# Interaction of demand and supply
- The equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of a good or service is determined by the intersection of the demand and supply curves, where quantity demanded is equal to quantity supplied
- The opposite is disequilibrium
	- Whenever there is a shortage/ surplus at a give price, market disequilibrium occurs
	- This will bring about an automatic change in prices, restoring to a new equilibrium price and quantity over time
## Consumer and producer surplus
- Consumer surplus is the difference that consumers are willing and able to pay for the unit of good and service, and the market price they actually pay
	- Area under demand curve and above market price
- Producer surplus is the difference between what producers are willing and able to supply the unit of good for, and the price they actually receive
	- Area above supply curve and under market price
