## Forces
- ==A force is a push or a pull==
- ==It is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment==
- It is a vector quantity
- SI units of Newton (N)
- One Newton is the amount of force to give a 1kg mass an acceleration of $1ms^{-2}$
- Hence, $1N = 1 ms^{-2}$
## Types of forces
- Contact forces are forces that involve direct contact between two bodies
	- Applied force, Normal Force, Friction, Drag/ Viscous force, Tension and Compression, Upthrust/ buoyant force
- Non contact forces are forces that act even when the forces are separated by empty space
	- Gravitational force, Magnetic force, Electric force
	- ==They act through a field, which is a region of space in which a force acts==
	- ==The type of force determines what is influenced by the force in the field==
## Gravitational force
- Gravitational force is due to the interaction between masses
- Gravitational force acting on an object is called weight if it is due to the gravity of the earth
- A mass experiences a force in a gravitational field
## Magnetic force
- Magnetic force is due to interaction between two magnets/ magnet and magnetic materials
- Moving charges and current-carrying conductors also experience magnetic force in a magnetic field
- The direction of magnetic force can be found using Fleming's left-hand rule
## Electric force
- Electrostatic force is due to interaction between charges
- A charge will experience an electric force in an electric field
## Applied force
- An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or another object
## Normal force
- ==The normal force is the support force exerted on an object that is in contact with another object==
- The force is perpendicular to the surface of contact and pointing away from the object
## Friction
- ==Friction is a force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes into contact with other==
- Friction is the force that opposes motion of an object
- Friction is caused by irregularities in the surfaces in mutual contact
- Friction depends on the surfaces in contact and how much they are pressed against each other
- Friction that exists when two surfaces are not sliding across one another is known as static friction
- Static friction prevents objects from motion
- Friction is proportional to normal force
- Friction sometimes does not oppose the direction of motion
## Drag/ viscous force
- ==Drag or viscous force is another kind of friction force when there is relative motion between an object and fluid such as air or water==
- Viscosity is the degree of internal friction in a liquid
- Objects moving in highly viscous fluids will experience a greater viscous force than in less viscous fluids
- In air, drag is known as air resistance
- In liquid, drag is known as viscous force
## Tension and compression
- A tension force is one that pulls materials apart, causing the body to be stretched/ tensioned
- A compression force is one that squeezes material together, causing the body to be compressed
### Hooke's law
- ==Hooke's law states that the deformation $x$ of an elastic object is proportional to the applied force $F$, provided that the limit of proportionality is not exceeded== $$F = kx$$
- $F$ = external force ($N$) , $k$ = Force constant  ($Nm^{-1}$), $x$ = deformation ($m$)
- The deformation is when the spring is not moving
- The spring constant $k$ is a measure of the stiffness of the elastic object
### Elastic potential energy
- Work is done when a force is applied to deform an elastic material
- This work done is stored as elastic potential energy in the deformed object until the force is removed and the object springs back into its original shape
- The elastic potential energy is the area under the force graph$$EPE = \frac{1}{2}Fx$$
- Using $F =kx$, $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2 = \frac{F^2}{2k}$$
- $F$ = external force ($N$) , $k$ = Force constant  ($Nm^{-1}$), $x$ = deformation ($m$)
- The extra work done to stretch a spring from $x_1$ to $x_2$ is $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2^2-x_1^2)$$
### Series combination of springs
- For a spring in series, the force F exerted on all of the springs is the same and $x_eff = x_1 + x_2 +...$
- From Hooke's law, $$\frac{F}{k_eff} = \frac{F}{k_1} + \frac{F}{k_2}+ ...+ \frac{F}{k_n}$$
- Since $F$ is the same,$$\frac{1}{k_eff} = \frac{1}{k_1} + \frac{1}{k_2}+ ...+ \frac{1}{k_n}$$

### Parallel combination of springs
- For a spring in parallel, the deformation $x$ of the spring is the same and $F_eff = F_1 + F_2+...$
- From Hooke's law, $$k_{eff}x = k_1x + k_2x + ... + k_nx$$
- Since $x$ is the same, $$k_{eff} = k_1 + k_2 + ... + k_n$$
## Upthrust/ Buoyancy force
- An object that is partly or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on its bottom than on the top surface
- ==This results in upthrust, which is an upward fore that acts on an object that is partly or completely submerged due to differences in pressure on the bottom surface of the object than on the top surface==
- Since $P = h \rho g$, where $P$ = Pressure, $h$ = depth, $\rho$ = density of fluid, $g$ = gravitational field strength, pressure increases as you go deeper in a fluid
### Deriving
- Upthrust $U$ = $F_{bottom} - F_{top}$ 
$= P_2A - P_1A$
$= [(P_0 + \rho g h_2) - P_0 + \rho g h_1)]A$
$= (h_2 - h_1)A \rho g$
$= HA \rho g$ 
$= V \rho g$
- $P_0$ = atmospheric pressure, $V = HA$ = Volume of solid, $\rho$ = density of fluid

### Archimedes' principle
- ==Archimedes' principle states that when an object is partially or totally immersed in a fluid, the upthrust on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the eight of the fluid displaced==
### Principle of flotation
- ==The principle of flotation states that when an object floats on a fluid, the upthrust that acts on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the e=weight of the object==
- An object is floating if it is not supported by anything but the liquid
## Centre of gravity
- ==The centre of gravity of a body is the point at which the entire weight of the body acts or appears to act==
- The weight does not actually act at a single point, it is distributed over the entire body
- But we can assume the entire force of gravity (weight) its concentrated at a point called the centre of gravity
- For symmetric bodies, the centre of gravity is at its geometric centre
- The centre of gravity can lie outside a body
- For a body with more complex shape, we can locate the centre of gravity using a support and plumb line
![[centre of gravity of lamina.png]]
- Since the weight of the object is concentrated in the center of gravity, the force of gravity passes through this point in a vertical line towards the earth
- A object hanging from any point will automatically rotate so that its centre of gravity is along this line from the hanging point
- Thus, hanging the shape at any point will cause the shape to rotate until the centre of gravity lines up directly below the hanging point
- Drawing a line along the plumb line enables us to see the vertical line between the hanging point and the centre of gravity
- But one line is not sufficient to pinpoint the centre as it could be anywhere along the line
- Hence, we hang the shape and different points and draw another line along the plumb line
## Turning effects of forces
- ==The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force and perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the axis==$$M = F 
 \times  r$$
 - M = Moment, F = Force, r = perpendicular distance
 - SI unit of Nm (Newton meter)
 - If F is not perpendicular to ab, we can resolve the force or find the perpendicular distance
### Couples
- ==A couple consists of two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and do not meet==
- The resultant force of a couple is zero, but the resultant torque is not zero
- The torque of a couple is the product of one force F, and the perpendicular distance between the forces $$\tau = F \times d$$
- $\tau$ = Torque, F = Force, d = perpendicular distance
## Equilibrium
- ==An object is in equilibrium is if it is in translational equilibrium and rotational equilibrium==
- ==Translational equilibrium - There is no resultant force on the system in any direction==
- ==Rotational equilibrium - There is no resultant torque on the system about any axis==
- Rotational equilibrium is also known as the principle of moments
- ==The principle of moments states that for a system in equilibrium, the sum of anti-clockwise moments about any axis is equal to the sum of clockwise moments about the same axis==
### Two forces
- Two forces acting on an object, T and W
- Translational equilibrium - T = W
- Rotational equilibrium - The lines of action of both T and W must coincide
### Three forces
- A closed triangle can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows of the forces follow each other around the triangle (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
- The lines of action of the three forces must pass through a common point in a free body diagram
### More than three forces
- A closed polygon can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The arrows showing the directions of the forces follow each other around the polygon (clockwise or anti-clockwise)
