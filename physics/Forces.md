- ==A force is a push or a pull. It is an interaction between two objects, or between an object and its environment==
- It is a vector
- Measured in Newtons (N)
- 1 Newtons is the amount of force required to give a 1kg mass an acceleration of $1ms^{-2}$, thus $1N = 1kgms^{-2}$
## Non-contact forces
- ==Non-contact forces are forces that act even when the bodies are separated by empty space==
- This is because they have a field, which is the region of space in which a forces acts
- The type of field determines what is influenced by the force in the field
### Gravitational force
- Gravitational force is due to the interaction between masses
- The amount of gravitational force acting on an object is called weight if it is due to the gravity of the earth
- A mass experiences a force in a gravitational field
### Magnetic force
- Magnetic force is due to interaction two magnets or a magnet and magnetic materials
- Moving charges and current carrying conductors also experience magnetic force in a magnetic fields
- The direction of magnetic force can be found using Fleming's left hand rule
- The current must be perpendicular to the magnetic field
### Electric force
- Electrostatic force is due to the interaction between charges
- A charge will also experience an electric force in an electric field
## Contact forces
- ==A contact force involves direct contact between two bodies==
### Applied force
- An applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or by another object
### Normal force
- ==The normal force is the support force exerted on an object that is in contact with another object==
- It is perpendicular to the surface of contact and pointing away
### Friction
- ==Friction is the force that resists motion when the surface of one object comes into contact with the surface of another==
- Opposes the motion of an object
- Caused by irregularities in the surfaces in mutual contact
- Depends on the surfaces in contact as well as how much they are pressed against each other
- For smooth surfaces we can neglect friction
- Static friction is friction that exists when the two surfaces are not sliding across each other, preventing them from motion
- Friction is proportional to normal force
### Viscous/ Drag force
- ==Viscous/ Drag force is friction that arises when there is relative motion between an object and a fluid (air/water)==
- Viscosity refers to the degree of internal friction in a fluid
- When the fluid is air, drag is also commonly known as air resistance 
- In liquid, drag is commonly known as viscous force
## Tension and compression
- A tension force is one that pulls materials apart
	- If a body is stretched, it is tensioned
- A compression force is one that squeezes bodies together
	- If a body is compressed, it is squeezed together
## Hooke's law
- ==Hooke's law states that the deformation of an elastic object is proportional to the applied force F, provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded==
$$F=kx, F = Force(N), k = Force\ constant (Nm^{-1}), x = deformation (m)$$
- The spring constant, $k$ is a measure of the stiffness of the object
### Elastic potential energy
- Work is done when a force is applied to deform an elastic material
- This work done is stored as elastic potential energy untilled the force is removed and the object springs back to its original shape
- The area under a force-extension graph gives us the elastic potential energy
$$EPE = \frac{1}{2}Fx, EPE = Elastic\ Potential\ Energy(J), F = Force (N), x = Deformation(m)$$
- Using $F=kx$
$$EPE = \frac{1}{2}kx^2= \frac{F^2}{2k},\ EPE = Elastic\ Potential\ Energy(J), F = Force(N), k = Force\ constant (Nm^{-1}), x = Deformation (m)$$
- Any extra work done in stretching the spring to $x_1$ to $x_2$ is given by the area shaded under the graph between these two points
$$W = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2\ ^2- x_1\ ^2)$$
- When an increasing force is applied to an elastic object, it may deform beyond its limit of proportionality, and the force-extension curve follows a different path
- But the elastic potential energy can always be found from the area under the curve
### Springs in series
- For springs in series, the force exerted on each spring is constant, and the effective extension is the sum of all of the extensions of the springs
$$ x_{eff} = x_1 + x_2$$
- Applying $F = kx$,
$$\frac{F}{K_{eff}}= \frac{F}{K_{1}} + \frac{F}{K_{2}}$$
$$\frac{1}{K_{eff}}= \frac{1}{K_{1}} + \frac{1}{K_{2}}$$
- For N springs connected in series,
$$\frac{1}{K_{eff}}= \frac{1}{K_{1}} + \frac{1}{K_{2}} + ... + \frac{1}{K_{N}}$$
### Springs in parallel
- For springs in parallel, the force exerted is equal to the sum of the force exerted on each spring, and the extension is constant
$$F = F_1 + F_2$$
$$k_{eff} = k_1x+ k_2x$$
$$k_eff = k_1 +k_2$$
- For N springs combined in series,
$$k_{eff} = k_1 +k_2 +... +k_N$$
## Upthrust/ buoyant force
- An object that is partly or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on the bottom surface than the top surface
- Pressure of a fluid is given by $$P = h\rho g, \rho = density (kgm^{-3}), g = gravitational\ field\ strength (ms^{-2}), h = depth\ below\ surface\ level(m)$$
- Hence, pressure increases as you go deeper in the fluid
- ==Upthrust is an upward force that an object that is partly or completely submerged experiences, due to a greater pressure on the bottom surface than the top surface==
$$U = V\rho g, V = Volume\ of\ solid (m^3), \rho = desnity\ of\ fluid (kgm^{-3}), g = gravitational\ field\ strength (ms^{-2})$$
### Archimedes principle
- ==Archimedes' principle states that when an object is partially or totally immersed in a fluid, the upthrust on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction of the weight of the fluid displaced==
$$Upthrust (N) =  Weight\ of\ Fluid\ Displaced (N)$$
### Principal of flotation
-== Principle of floatation states that when an object floats on a fluid, the upthrust that acts on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object==
$$Upthrust (N) = Weight\ of\ the\ object (N)$$
## Centre of gravity
-== The centre of gravity of a body is the point at which the weight of the body acts or appears to act==
- The centre of gravity of a homogeneous sphere, cube, circular sheet or rectangular plate is at its geometric centre
- For bodies with more complex shapes, we can locate the centre of gravity using a support and a plumbline.
	- Since the weight of an object is concentrated in its centre of gravity, the force of gravity passes through this point in a vertical line towards the earth
	- An object hanging from any point will automatically rotate so that its centre of gravity is along this vertical line from the hanging point
	- Hanging the shape at any point will cause the shape to rotate until the centre of gravity lines up directly below the hanging point
## Turning effects of forces
- ==The moment of a force is the product of the force and the perpendicular distance from the line of action to the axis==$$M = F \times r, M = Moment (Nm), F = Force(N), r = Perpendicular\ distance\ to\ the\ axis (m)$$
- SI unit of Newton meter (Nm)
- If the force is not perpendicular to the axis, we can resolve the perpendicular distance or resolve the force
### Couples
- A special case of moment is a couple, which consist of== two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction and do not meet==
- The resultant force of a couple is zero, but the resultant moment is not zero
$$\tau = F \times d, \tau = Moment (Nm), F = Force\ of\ one\ force\ (N), d = Perpedicular\ Distance\ between\ both\ Forces$$
## Equilibrium
- A system is in equilibrium if these 2 conditions are satisfied
	- ==Translational equilibrium - No resultant force on the system in any direction;== $\Sigma F = 0$
	- ==Rotational equilibrium - No resultant torque about any axis;== $\Sigma \tau = 0$
- Rotational equilibrium is also the ==principle of moments, where for a system in equilibrium, the sum of clockwise moments about one axis is equal to the sum of anti-clockwise moments about the same axis==
### Two forces
- For translational equilibrium, both forces must be the same magnitude and in opposite directions
- For rotational equilibrium, both the lines of action of the forces must coincide
### Three forces
- A closed triangle can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The directions of the forces follow each other around the triangle, clockwise or anti-clockwise
- The lines of action of the three forces must pass through a common point
- Reaction force is the resultant of normal force and friction
### More than three forces
 - A closed polygon can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The directions of the forces follow each other around the polygon, clockwise or anti-clockwise
