## Distance and displacement
- ==Distance is the total length of the path travelled by a body, regardless of direction travelled==
	- Scalar -> Magnitude but no direction

- ==Displacement is the distance travelled in a straight line in a specified direction, from some reference point==
	- Vector -> Magnitude and direction

- Both have an SI unit of metre (m)
- To define displacement, we need to set a reference starting position, and then decide on a sign convention (e.g. taking motion to the right to be positive)
## Speed and velocity
- ==Speed is the rate of change of distance, or distance travelled per unit time==
	- Per is important because it signifies that speed is a ratio
	- $Speed = \frac{Distance\ Travelled}{Time \ Taken}$
	- Scalar quantity

- ==Velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement, or displacement per unit time==
	- $Velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ Displacement}{Time\ Taken}$
	- Vector quantity

- Both have an SI unit of metres per second ($ms^{-1}$)
- Average speed is the total distance travelled over the total time taken 
	- $Average\ Speed = \frac{Distance\ Travelled}{Time\ Taken}=\frac{\Delta D}{\Delta t}$
- Average velocity is the total displacement over the total time taken
	- $Average\ Velocity = \frac{Change\ of\ Displacement}{Time\ Taken}=\frac{\Delta s}{\Delta t}$

- Instantaneous speed is defined as the rate of change of distance (with time)
	- $Instantaneous\ Speed = Instantaneous\ rate\ of\ change\ of\ change\ of\ distance = \frac{dD}{dt}$
- Instantaneous velocity is defined as the rate of change of displacement (with time)
	- $Instantaneous\ Speed = Instantaneous\ rate\ of\ change\ of\ displacement = \frac{ds}{dt}$
## Acceleration
- ==Acceleration is defined as the rate of change of velocity, or the change of velocity per unit time==$$Acceleration = \frac{change\ in\ velocity}{time\ taken} = \frac{dv}{dt}$$
- Average acceleration is  defined as the total change in velocity over the total time interval$$Average\ acceleration = \frac{overall\ change\ in\ velocity}{total\ time\ taken}$$
- Acceleration is a vector quantity
- Deceleration refers to object which are slowing down (magnitude of velocity decreasing) regardless of the direction of motion
	- It is different from negative acceleration, which tells us the direction of acceleration with respect to a sign convention
## Graphs
- Graphical depictions provide a comprehensive account of how objects move
- The two primary aspects that receive attention in graphical interpretation are the area and the gradient
- The gradient signifies the rate of change of the variable

| Type of graph | Gradient represents | Area represents |
|-|-|-|
| Displacement-time | Velocity | - |
| Velocity-time | Acceleration | Change in displacement |
| Acceleration-time | - | Change in Velocity |
- If the graph is not a straight line, we can divide the area under the curve into small trapeziums to find the area
## Equations of kinematics
- This only applies to uniform motion, where acceleration is constant
$$a = acceleration,\ u = inital\ velocity,\ v = final\ velocity,\ t = time $$
$$v = u+ at$$
$$s = \frac{1}{2}(u+v)t$$
$$s = ut + \frac{1}{2}at^2$$
$$v^2=u^2+2as$$
## Free fall in a gravitational field with air resistance
- Without air resistance, the downward acceleration is $9.81ms^{-2}$ due to gravity
- With air resistance, A falling object 
	- will still accelerate downwards, but will not remain steady at $9.81ms^{-2}$
	- Instead, it will decrease until it eventually reaches 0
- When a body first starts to fall from rest,
	- Initial velocity is 0
	- Since it is not moving, it does not experience any air resistance
	- Acceleration is $a = g = 9.81ms^{-2}$ as gravity is the only force acting on it
- As the body gains velocity in the downwards direction,
	- It experiences increasing air resistance against its motion in the upwards direction
	- Hence, the net force it experiences is $mg-F_{air}$, which is smaller in magnitude than mg alone
	- Applying F = ma, $a = g - \frac{F_{air}}{m}$, which is lesser than the acceleration when the body was at rest at the start
- Eventually, the velocity of the body is so large that the air resistance it experiences is equal to the body's weight
	- There is no net force, hence there is no acceleration and the velocity falls at a constant velocity known as terminal velocity
## Projectile motion
- When an object is thrown into the air at an angle to the ground, it will follow a parabolic path/ trajectory
- The only force acting on the object is the force of gravity acting vertically downwards, as long as the object is not in contact with anything and air resistance is negligible
- By newton's second law, the only acceleration the object will experience is the acceleration due to gravity ($9.81ms^{-2}$ vertically downwards)
- Horizontally, the objects velocity is constant as the object does not experience any force horizontally
### Range
- For maximum range, the angle to the horizontal at which the object is launched at is $45\degree$ 
- It is possible to obtain the same range with two different angles
- When air resistance is negligible, the parabolic trajectory is 
	- symmetrical about its highest point
	- has a larger range
	- higher highest point
- With air resistance, the parabolic trajectory is 
	- asymmetrical about its highest point
	- has a shorter range
	- lower highest point
- Air resistance causes the acceleration to be non uniform, making the vertical velocity curve decrease at a decreasing rate, and make the ball reach its highest point earlier
- Air resistance causes the horizontal velocity to drop, making it not constant
