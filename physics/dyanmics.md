## Newton's first law
- ==Newton's first law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same velocity unless acted upon by an unbalanced force==
- ==Inertia is the tendency of an object to continue in its original motion==
- Inertia is dependent on the mass of the object; the greater the mass, the less it accelerates under the action of a given applied force
- Mass is a measure of inertia, while weight is the gravitational force acting on a mass
## Linear momentum
- ==The linear momentum of an object is the product of the mass of the object and the velocity of the object==$$p = mv$$
- $p$ = Linear momentum
- $m$ = Mass
- $v$ = Velocity
- SI unit of $kg m s ^{-1}$ or $Ns$
- Momentum is a vector quantity
- A heavy object moving with high velocity has a large momentum, while a small object moving slowly has a small momentum, and a small object moving with a high velocity has a large momentum
## Newton's second law
- ==Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the net force acting on the object, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force==$$F \propto \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
- $F$ = Force
- $m$ = Mass
- $v$ = Velocity
- $t$ = Time
### Deriving F=ma
$$F \propto \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
- Since we are using SI units, k = 1$$F = \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
$$F = m \frac{dv}{dt} + v \frac{dm}{dt}$$
- Since mass is constant, $\frac{dm}{dt} = 0$ and $\frac{dv}{dt} = a$ $$F=ma$$
- $F$ = Force
- $m$ = Mass
- $a$ = Acceleration
### Impulse
- For a variable force $F$ acting over a period of time $t$, the integral of the force over the time interval is known as the impulse of the force
- ==The impulse momentum theorem states that the impulse of the force acting on the object is equal to the change in momentum of the object==$$Change\ in\ momentum\ \Delta P = Impulse\ I = Area\ under\ f-t\ graph$$
## Newton's third law
- ==Newton's third law states that if a body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert an equal and opposite reaction force on body A==
- This reaction force is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force exerted on it
- The forces act on two different objects, hence they don't cancel each other
### Weightlessness
- The actual weight of a person is determined by his mass and the acceleration of gravity
- But the "perceived/ effective weight" comes from the fact that he is supported but other objects such as the floor, or chair
- If all support is removed suddenly and the person begins to fall freely, they suddenly feel weightless
- Weightlessness refers to a state of being in free fall in which there is no perceived support (i.e. no reaction force on the person by any support)
- Felt when a lift cable breaks, going over the top of a rollercoaster, being in orbit, or putting an "aircraft over the hump" in ballistic trajectory
## Principle of conservation of momentum
- ==The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the system after the collision, **provided no external force acts on the system**== $$M_aU_a + M_bU_b = M_aV_a + M_bV_b$$
- $M$ = mass
- $U$ = initial velocity
- $V$ = final velocity
### Deriving the principle of conservation of momentum
- Consider mass $A$ travelling with initial velocity $u_a$ collides with mass $B$ travelling at initial velocity $u_b$
- During the collision, the two masses are in contact and exert a force $F$ on each other
- By newton's second law, $$For\ A: F_a = M_a(V_a-U_a)/t$$$$For\ B: F_b = m_b(V_b-U_b)/t$$
- By newton's third law,$$F_b = -F_a$$
- Rearranging,$$M_aU_a + M_bU_b = M_aV_a + M_bV_b$$
## Elastic collisions
- In an elastic collision, the total momentum and total kinetic energy is conserved
- In an inelastic collision, the total momentum is conserved, while the total kinetic energy is not conserved
- For elastic collision, we can deduce that the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation$$U_a -U_b = V_b-V_a$$
- $u$ = initial velocity
- $v$ = final velocity
### Deriving the elastic collisions equation
- Principle of conservation of momentum$$M_aU_a + M_bU_b = M_aV_a + M_bV_b$$
- Rewriting,$$M_a(U_a-V_a)= M_b(V_b-U_b)$$
- Since kinetic energy is conserved, $$\frac{1}{2}(M_a)(U_a)^2+ \frac{1}{2}(M_b)(U_b)^2 = \frac{1}{2}(M_a)(V_a)^2 + \frac{1}{2}(M_b)(V_b)^2$$
- Rewriting, $$M_aU_a^2 - M_aV_a^2 = M_bV_b^2 - M_bU_b^2$$
$$M_a(U_a+V_a)(U_a-V_a) = M_b(V_b+U_b)(V_b-U_b)$$
- Taking equation 2 รท 1 gives$$U_a -U_b = V_b-V_a$$
