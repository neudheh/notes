## Physical Quantities
- Comprises  of a numerical magnitude and a unit
$$F=5N$$
- F (Force) is the physical quantity
- 5 is the magnitude
- N (Newtons) is the unit of measurement
## Base units
- Base quantities are fundamental quantities, which cannot be expressed as a combination of simpler quantities
- SI units are International System of Units, which is a standard system of units for the fundamental quantities of science
- Base units, or SI base units are the units of these base quantities

|Base quantity | Base Units | Symbol |
|-|-|-|
| Mass | Kilogram | kg|
| Length | Metre | m |
| Time | Second | s |
| Temperature | Kelvin | K |
| Electric current | Ampere | A |
| Amount of substance | Mole | mol|
## Derived units
- Derived quantities are quantities that are derived from a combination of base quantities
$$ Speed = \frac{Length}{Time}$$
- The unit for length is $m$, the unit for time is $s$, hence the unit for speed is $ms^-1$
- Some derived quantities are unitless, such as refractive index
## Prefixes
- Prefixes are useful for expressing units of physical quantities that are wither very big or very small

| Factor | Prefix | Symbol |
|-|-|-|
| $10^{12} | Terra | T |
| $10^{9} | Giga | G |
| $10^{6} | Mega | M |
| $10^{3} | Kilo | K |
| $10^{-1} | Deci | d |
| $10^{-2} | Centi | c |
| $10^{-3} | Milli | m |
| $10^{-6} | Micro | Âµ |
| $10^{-9} | Nano | n |
| $10^{-12} | Pico | p |

- Orders of magnitude is usually written as $10^n$ , where n represents the order of magnitude of a physical quantity
- Each order of magnitude is 10 times larger than the previous
## Estimating
- An estimate is a rough educated guess at the value of a physical quantity based on prior experience and sound physical reasoning
- Estimates allow one to perform checks on calculations to rule out uncertain scenarios or unrealistic numbers
## Scalar and vector quantities
- Scalar quantities are quantities with magnitude but no direction
	- e.g. Mass, Temperature, Length, Energy
- Vector quantities are quantities with magnitude and directions
	- e.g. Displacement, Velocity, Acceleration, Force
## Vector addition
- The resultant of 2 or more vectors is the vector addition of the vectors
- We also need to include the angle to the horizontal/ vertical when giving our answer
1. Head to tail method
![[Tip to tail method.png]]
- Connect the heads of one vector to the tail of one vector
- The Resultant force must start from the tail of the firs vector and end at the head of the last vector
- We can also use it for multiple vectors

1. Parallelogram method
![[Paralellogram method.png]]
- Only can be used on two vectors
- We can use cosine rule to find `|A+B|`
## Vector subtraction
- Vectors cannot be subtractions
- But $A - B$ Can be rewritten as $A + (-B)$, where $-B$ is vector B in the opposite direction
- Can be used to find
	- Vector A relative to vector B ($A-B$)
	- Change in Vector ($A_{final}- A_{initial}$)
## Resolution of vectors
- Resolution of a vector is the process of splitting a vector into two mutually perpendicular components
- The components add up to give the original vector
