- A search algorithm is an algorithm that checks for the existence of an element, or to retrieve an element from any data structure where it is stored
- There is linear search and binary search
## Big-O notation
- Big-O notation shows the time needed to execute a line of code
- Constants are dropped
- Every statement that operates on one item at once has a time complexity of $O(1)$
- A for loop looping through an array of size $n$ has a time complexity of $O(n)$
- A nested for loop looping through an array of size $n$ has a time complexity of $O(n^2$)
## Linear Search
- Linear search involves looping through each item in the array, and checking its value against the target value
- If it has reached the end of the array, and still has not found the value, it returns -1
- In the worst case, the target is present at the last index of the list, so the worst case time complexity is $O(n)$
- Simple to implement and easy to understand
- Can be used if the array is not sorted or not
- Can be used on arrays of any data type
- Suitable for small data sets
- Slow for large data sets
### for loop
```pseudo
FUNCTION linear_search (x: ARRAY, target: INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
	FOR i <- 0 TO length of x - 1
		IF target = x[i]
			THEN 
				RETURN i
		ENDIF
	ENDFOR
	RETURN -1
ENDFUNCTION
```

```Python
def linear_search(x, target):
	for i in range(len(x)):
		if x[i] == target:
			return i
	return -1
```

### while loop
```pseudo
FUNCTION linear_search (x: ARRAY, target: INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
	counter <- 0
	WHILE counter < length of x
		IF x[counter] = target
			THEN
				RETURN counter
		ENDIF
		counter <- counter + 1
	ENDWHILE
ENDFUNCTION
```

```Python
def linear_search(x, target):
	counter = 0
	while counter < len(x):
		if x[counter] == target:
			return counter
		counter += 1
	return -1
```
## Binary search
- Binary search is used in a **sorted** array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half
- Uses the idea that the array is sorted to reduce time complexity
1. Set the lower index to the first element of the array and the upper index to the last element of the array
2. Set the middle index to the average of the low and high indexes
	- If the element at the middle index is the target element, return the middle index
	- If the element at the middle index is more than the target element, set the upper index to the middle index - 1
	- If the element at the middle index is lesser than the target element, set the lower index to the middle index + 1
3. Repeat step 2 until the target element is found or the search space is exhausted
- In the worst case, the element is at the first or last index, so the worst case time complexity is $O(\log n)$
- Binary search is faster than linear search, especially for larger arrays
- The time complexity of linear search increases linearly, while the time complexity of binary search increases logarithmically
- But, the array must be sorted, adding an additional $O(n \log n)$ time complexity for the sorting step to sort the array
### while loop
```pseudo
FUNCTION binary_search(A: ARRAY, target: INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
	lower <- 0
	upper <- length of A
	WHILE lower <= upper DO
		mid <- (lower + upper) DIV 2
		IF target = A[mid]
			THEN
				RETURN mid
			ELSE
				IF target > A[mid]
					THEN
						lower <- mid + 1
					ELSE
						upper <- mid - 1
				ENDIF
		ENDIF
	ENDWHILE
	RETURN -1
ENDFUNCTION
```

```Python
def binary_search(x, target):
	low = 0
	high = len(x)
	while high >= low:
		mid = (low + high) // 2
		if x[mid] == target:
			return mid
		elif target > x[mid]:
			low = mid + 1
		else:
			high = mid -1
	return -1
```
### Recursion
```pseudo
FUNCTION binary_search(A: ARRAY, target: INTEGER, lower: INTEGER, upper: INTEGER) RETURNS INTEGER
	IF lower > upper
		THEN
			RETURN -1
		ELSE
			mid <- (lower + upper) DIV 2
			IF target = A[mid]
				THEN
					RETURN mid
				ELSE
					IF target > A[mid]
						THEN
							RETURN binary_search(A, target, mid + 1, upper)
						ELSE
							RETURN binary_search(A, target, lower, mid - 1)
					ENDIF
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

```python
def binary_search(x, target, low, high)
	if low > high:
		return -1
	mid = (low + high) // 2
	if x[mid] == target:
		return mid
	elif target > A[mid]:
		return binary_search(x, target, mid + 1, high)
	else:
		return binary_search(x, target, low, mid - 1)
