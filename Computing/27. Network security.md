## Threats
### Malware
- Malware is the general term for software that is designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorised access to a computer system
### Ransomware
- A type of malware that blocks access to the victim's computer until a certain amount of money is paid
### Scareware
- A program that frightens the victim into buying unnecessary software or providing their financial data
- It pops up on a user's desktop with flashing images and alarms, announcing that the computer has been infected
- It urges the victim to enter their credit card and download a fake antivirus program
### Spyware
- A hidden program that secretly collects personal information and sends it to attackers without the user's knowledge, without causing data corruption or loss
- Spyware records the websites visited, information about the computer system and vulnerabilities for a future attack, or the user's keystrokes
- Spyware that records keystrokes are called keyloggers, stealing passwords, account numbers, credit cards, and other sensitive data by logging what is typed
### Adware
- Adware pushes unwanted advertisements onto users
### Fileless malware
- Fileless malware does not download code onto a computer, so there is no malware signature for a virus scanner to detect
- It operates in the computer's memory and evades protection by hiding utility, productivty tools, or security application
- Some fileless malware does not need a victim to click on a file to activate it
### Cookies
- A small piece of data used by website to store personal information on a user's computer
- It is misused by attackers to collect personal information on users
### Pharming
- The interception of requests sent from a computer to a legitimate website and redirecting to a fake website to steal personal data or credit cards

- The attacker can then use the personal data to access the victim's bank account in the actual website
### Phishing
- The use of emails and fake websites that appear to be from reputable companies
- It is used to steal personal information such as passwords and credit cards from users
### Spamming
- The mass distribution of unwanted messages or advertising sent to email addresses collected from public mailing lists, social media, company websites and blogs
- Emails are easily sent to users and used to lure them to enter their personal information and steal their personal data
### Trojan horse
- A computer program that pretends to be a harmless file or useful application
- When it is run, it does something harmful such as giving intruders unauthorised access to the computer
### Virus
- A computer program that attaches itself to a normal harmless program and modifies it
- When the modified program is run, it attaches copies of itself to any other programs it can finds, and infects it
### Worm
- A standalone computer program that runs automatically and attempts to spread copies of itself over a network
- It does not attach itself to a program, it spreads by exploiting a vulnerability in the infected system, or through email as an attachment pretending to be a legitimate file
### DOS attacks
- ==A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is an attempt by a malicious actor to overload a website or network, to degrade performance or make it inaccessible to intended users==
- DoS attacks function by overwhelming or flooding a targeted machine with requests until normal traffic is unable to be processed, resulting in denial of service to additional users
- A single computer is used to launch the attack
### DDOS attack
- ==A Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service of network by overwhelming the target or surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic==
- They achieve effectiveness by using multiple compromised computer systems, which make a network of internet connected machine, as sources of internet traffic
- Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices
- The machines are infected with malware, allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker
- They are referred to as bots, and a groups of bots is called a botnet
- Once a botnet has been established, the attacker is able to direct an attack by sending remote instructions to each bot
- When a victim's server or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot sends requests to the target's IP address, causing the server or network to become overwhelmed
- This results in a denial-of-service to normal traffic
## Firewalls
- ==Firewalls act as a filter that monitors access between an organisation's internal network and the internet, allowing some packets to pass but not others==
- A firewall allows a network admin to control access between the outside world and resources within the network by managing the traffic flow to and from these resources
### Software and hardware firewalls
- Hardware firewalls are physical, like broadband routers, connecting the network and gateway through wires
- Software firewalls are internal, a program on computers that works through port numbers and applications
- There are also cloud-based firewalls, known as firewalls as a service (FaaS)
- They can grow within organisations, and do well with perimeter security (preventing unauthorised users from accessing a network)
### Host-based and network-based firewalls
- A host-based firewall is installed on an individual computer to protect it form activity occurring on its network
- Its policy may affect what the computer accepts from the internet, from the local network, or even from itself
- A network-based firewall is implemented at a specific point in the network path
- It protects all computers on the internal side of the firewall from all computers on the external side of the firewall
- It can also protect one segment of the community from another, such as protecting residential and corporate systems
- It cannot protect one computer from another on the same network, or another computer from itself
### How it works
1. **Traffic control** - All incoming and outgoing communications must pass through the firewall, which is at the boundary between the administered network and the internet
	- Large organisations may use multiple levels of firewalls, or distributed firewalls
	- A firewall at a single access point to the network is easier to manage and enforce a security-access policy, creating a single choke point for inspection
2. **Authorised traffic** - Only authorised traffic, defined by the local security policy, will be allowed to pass
	- Unauthorised access attempts are blocked protecting valuable network resources
3. **Maintaining security** - While connected to the network, the firewall is designed to be resistant to attacks
	- It acts as a robust barrier, preventing external threats from infiltrating the internal network
- There are several different types of firewalls based on their size and functionality
- **Packet filters** occur at a gateway router that connects the internal network to the ISP, examining each packet based on administrator-specific rules
- **Stateful packet filters** track TCP connections and use this information to make filtering decisions
- **Application gateways** are application specific servers where all application data, inbound and outbound, must pass through
	- They look beyond the IP/ TCP/ UDP headers and make policy decisions based on application data
### Limitations
- They cannot protect against attacks from a source if a user has explicitly allowed it to bypass the firewall
- They cannot protect against internal attacks since the malicious traffic may not need to pass through a firewall
- As the firewall is a single point of failure, the system becomes vulnerable when the firewall becomes compromised
## Intrusion detection system and intrusion prevention system
- ==An intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device that generates alerts when it observes potentially malicious traffic==
- ==Intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a device that filters out suspicious traffic==
- They do so by using deep packet inspection, looking beyond the IP/ TCP headers and into the application data that the packets carry
- Applications gateways do this, but this is only possible for a single application
### How it works
- IDS not only does deep packet inspection, but also compares each packet with tens of thousands of signatures
- By placing IDS sensors further downstream, each sensor only sees a fraction of the traffic, and can easily keep up
- High performance IDS and IPS systems are available today, and many organisations can get by with just one sensor near their access router
### Signature-based
- A signature-based IDS system maintains an extensive database of attack signatures
- Each signature is a set of rules pertaining to an intrusion activity
- Signatures may simply be a list of characteristics about a single packet (e.g. source and destination port numbers, protocol type), or may relate to a series of packets
- These signatures are created by network security engineers who research known attacks
- A network administrator can customise the signatures, or add its own to the database
- A signature-based system will sniff every packet passing by, comparing each sniffed packet with the signatures in its database
- If a packet matches a signature, the IDS generates an alert, which could be sent to the network admin, the network management system, or logged for future inspection
### Limitations
- But, they require previous knowledge of the attack to generate an accurate signature; it is completely blind to new attacks that have yet to be recorded
- Even if a signature is matched, it may not be the result of an attack, resulting in false alarms
- Because every packet must be compared with the large database of signatures, the IDS can become overwhelmed with processing and fail to detect malicious packets
### Anomaly-based
- Anomaly-based IDS creates a traffic profile as it observes traffic in normal operation
- It then looks for unusual packet streams, such as a sudden growth in port scans and ping sweeps
- It does not reply on previous knowledge of existing attacks, and can detect new, undocumented attacks
- But, it is hard to detect normal traffic, and unusual traffic
## Encryption
- ==Encryption is a process that uses an algorithm and a key to code a message written in plain text into cipher text, which is then transmitted to the recipient==
- Decryption is decoding the ciphertext back into the original plain text using a decryption algorithm and a key
- Encryption is used to protect data from unauthorised access by allowing only authorised users to have the secret key
- It can be used with file permissions so that unauthorised users who bypassed file permissions would be unable to use the access data without knowing the secret key
- Cryptography is used for confidentiality, authentication, message-integrity, and repudiation, which is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something
### Symmetric key encryption
- There is only one key, which is shared by the sender and receiver of a message
- The sender uses the encryption algorithm together with the key to encrypt plain text
- The receiver then decrypts the ciphertext using the same key
- But, it is difficult to securely deliver the key to the receiver for decryption
### Public key encryption
- It is a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt data
- The pair of keys include a public key, which is sent to anyone who is going to partake in encrypted communication
- There is also a private key, which is kept secret by the owner and never sent to anyone
- The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the data, and the recipient then uses their private key to decrypt the data
- This allows for secure communication between two parties, without the need for both parties to have the same secret key, eliminating the need to exchange secret keys
## Digital signature
- A digital signature authenticates the signature
- It is a cryptographic technique to indicate the owner or creator of a resource, or to signify one's agreement with a document's content in a digital world
- It proves that a document signed by an individual was indeed singed by that individual and only that individual could sign the document
- An individual can encrypt a message using a private key, and send this to a recipient who has the public key, and can then decrypt the ciphertext
- This verifies who the sender is, as only the sender has the private key and the public key only works with that private key
- But, this should not be used with confidential information as anyone can have the public key
### Public cryptographic one-way hash function
- Digital signature can be generated via encryption techniques, but encryption and decryption is computationally expensive and overkill
- An alternative is to use a public cryptographic one-way hash function which creates a fixed length hash that is uniquely defined for that message, called a digest
- The private key is used to encrypt the digest, making it the digital signature
- The message can be transmitted as plain text together with the encrypted digest as a separate file
- As the digest is much smaller than the whole message, the encryption and transmission are faster processes than if the whole message was encrypted
![[Pasted image 20240526174840.png]]
- At the receiving end, the same public one-way hash function is then used to create a digest from the received message
- The encrypted version of the original digest is then decrypted using the public key
- If the two digests match, the message is authentic and has been transmitted unaltered
## Authentication
- End-point authentication is the process of one party proving its identity to another over a computer network
- Often, network elements like routers and clients/ servers must authenticate each other
- Authentication can be done solely based on messages and the data exchanged as part of an authentication protocol
- The authentication protocol establishes the identities of the parties to each other's satisfaction, before they get down to the work at hand
- Typically, an authentication protocol would run before the two communicating parties run some other protocol
- Common ways of encryption include passwords, biometrics, and token values
- 2FA uses two different ways of encryption for better security
