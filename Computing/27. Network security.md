## Threats
### Malware
- Malware is the general term for software that is specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to a computer system
#### Ransomware
- A type of malware that blocks access to the victim's computer system until a certain amount of money, usually in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency is paid
#### Scareware
- A program that attempts to frighten the victim into buying unnecessary software or providing their financial data
- It pops up on a users desktop with flashing images and loud alarms, announcing that the computer has been infected
- It urges the victim to enter their credit card data and download a fake antivirus program
#### Spyware
- A hidden program that secretly collects personal information about users and send that information to attacks without the user's knowledge, without causing data corruption or loss
- Spyware records the websites visited, information about the computer system and vulnerabilities for a future attack, or the user's keystrokes
- Spyware that records keystrokes are known as a keylogger, which steals passwords, account number, credit cards, and other sensitive data by logging what is typed
#### Adware
- Adware pushes unwanted advertisements at users
#### Fileless malware
- Fileless malware does not download code onto a computer, so there is now malware signature for a virus scanner to detect
- Instead, it operates in the computer's memory and may evade protection by hiding in a trusted utility, productivity tool, or security application
- Some fileless malware is clickless, so a victim does not need to click on a file to activate it
#### Cookies
- A small piece of data used by websites to store personal information on a user's computer
- It is misused by attackers to collect personal information about users
#### Pharming
- The interception of requests sent form a computer to a legitimate website and redirection to a fake website to steal personal data or credit cards
- The attacker can use the personal detail to access the victim's bank account in the actual website
#### Phishing
- The use of emails and fake websites that appear to be from reputable companies
- It is used to steal personal information such as passwords and credit cards from users
#### Spamming
- The mass distribution of unwanted messages or advertising sent to email addresses collected from sources such as public mailing lists, social networking sites, company websites, and blogs
- Emails are easily sent to users and used to lure users to enter their personal information and steal their personal data
#### Trojan horse
- A computer program that pretends to be a harmless file or useful application
- When it is run, it does something harmful such as giving intruders unauthorized access to the computer instead
#### Virus
- A computer program that attaches itself to a normally harmless program and modifies it
- When the modified program is run, it attaches copies of itself to any other programs it can find, thus infecting it
#### Worm
- A standalone computer program that runs automatically and attempts to spread copies of itself over a network
- It does not attach itself to a program and spreads by exploiting a vulnerability in the infected system, or thorough email as an attachment pretending to be a legitimate file
- It consumes bandwidth and overload web servers, harming the host network
### DOS attacks
- ==A Denial of Service (DOS) attack is an attempt by a malicious actor to overload a website or network, with the aim or degrading performance or making it inaccessible to intended users==
- DoS attacks function by overwhelming or flooding a targeted machine with requests until normal traffic is unable to be processed, resulting in denial of service to additional users
- It is characterized by a single computer being used to launch the attack
### DDOS attack
- ==A distributed denial of service attack (DDOS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal traffic of a targeted server, service or network by overwhelming the target or surrounding infrastructure with a flood of internet traffic==
- They achieve effectiveness by using multiple compromised computer systems, which make a network of internet-connected machines, as sources of attack traffic
- Exploited machines can include computers and other networked resources such as IoT devices
- The machines are infected with malware, allowing them to be controlled remotely by an attacker
- They are referred to as bots, and a group of bots is called a botnet
- Once a botnet has been established, the attacker is able to direct and attack by sending remote instructions to each bot
- When a victim's server or network is targeted by the botnet, each bot sends request to the target's IP address, causing the server or network to become overwhelmed
- This result in a denial-of-service to normal traffic
## Protection mechanisms
### Firewalls
- ==A firewall acts as a filter that monitors access between an organizations internal network and the internet at large, allowing some packets to pass and blocking others==
- A firewall allows a network admin to control access between the outside world and resources within the network by managing the traffic flow to and from these resources
#### Software and hardware firewalls
- Hardware firewalls are physical, like broadband routers, connecting the network and gateway through hardware like wires
- A software firewall is internal, a program on computers that works through port numbers and applications
- There are also cloud-based firewalls, known as firewalls as a service (FaaS)
- They can grow within organizations, and do well with perimeter security (preventing unauthorized users from accessing a network)
#### Host-based and Network-based firewalls
- A host-based firewall is installed on an individual computer to protect it from activity occurring on its network
- The policy may affect what traffic the computer accepts form the internet, from the local network, or even from itself
- A network-based firewall is implemented at a specified point in the network path and protects all computers on the 'internal' side of the firewall from all computers on the 'external' side of the firewall
- Network based firewalls may be installed on the perimeter of a network to protect a corporation from hosts on the internet
- It can also internally protect one segment of a community from another, such as separating corporate and residential systems 
- It cannot protect one computer from another on the same network, or any computer from itself
#### How it works
- Firewalls have 3 goals
1. **Traffic control** - all incoming and outgoing communications must pass through the firewall, which sits at the boundary between the administered network and the rest of the internet
	- Large organizations may use multiple levels of firewalls or distributed firewalls
	- A firewall at a single access point to the network is easier to manage and enforce a security-access policy, creating a single choke point for inspection
2. **Authorized traffic** - Only authorized traffic, as defined as the local security policy, will be allowed to pass
	- Unauthorized access attempts are blocked, protecting valuable network resources
3. **Maintaining security** - While connected to the network, the firewall is designed to be resistant to attacks
	- It acts as a robust barrier, preventing external threats from infiltrating the internal network
- There are several different types of firewalls based on their size and functionality
- **Packet filters** occur at a gateway router that connects the internal network to its ISP, examining each packet based on administrator-specific rules
- **Stateful packet filters** track TCP connections and use this information to make filtering decisions
- **Application gateways** are application specific servers through which all application data, inbound and outbound must pass
	- They look beyond the IP/TCP/UDP headers and make policy decisions based on application data
#### Limitations
- They cannot protect against attacks from a source if a user has explicitly allowed it to bypass the firewall
	- E.g. some apps may ask the user to allow adding an exception in the firewall software so that the application can send or receive data without being blocked by the firewall
	- But, this prevents the firewall from stopping any malicious traffic into the application
- They cannot protect against internal attacks since the malicious traffic may not need to pass through a firewall
- As a firewall is a single point of failure, the system becomes vulnerable when the firewall is compromised
### Intrusion Detection System and Intrusion Prevention System
- ==Intrusion detection system (IDS) is a device that generates alerts when it observes potentially malicious traffic==
- ==Intrusion prevention system (IPS) is a device that filters out suspicious traffic==
- They do so by using deep packet inspection, looking beyond the IP/TCP headers and into the application data that the packets carry
- Application gateways do this, but this is only possible for a single application
#### How it works
- IDS not only needs to do deep packet inspection, but also must compare each packet with tens of thousands of signatures
- By placing IDS sensors further downstream, each sensor only sees a fraction of the traffic, and can easily keep up
- High-performance IDS and IPS systems are available today, and many organizations can get by with just one sensor near their access router
#### Signature-based
- ==A signature-based IDS system maintains an extensive database of attack signatures==
- Each signature is a set of rules pertaining to an intrusion activity
- Signatures may simply be a list of characteristics about a single packet (e.g. source and destination port numbers, protocol type), or may relate to a series of packets
- These signatures are created by network security engineers who research known attacks
- A network administrator can customize the signatures or add its own to the database\
- A signature-based system will sniff every packet passing by, comparing each sniffed packet with the signature in the database
- If a packet matches a signature, the IDS generates an alert, which could be sent to the network admin, the network management system, or logged for future inspection
#### Limitations
- But, they require previous knowledge of the attack to generate an accurate signature
	- It is completely blind to new attacks that have yet to be recorded
- Even if a signature is matched, it may not be the result of an attack, resulting in false alarms
- Because every packet must be compared with the large database of signatures, the ID can become overwhelmed with processing and fail to detect malicious packets
#### Anomaly-based
- Anomaly-based IDS creates a traffic profile as it observes traffic in normal operation
- It then looks for unusual packet streams, for example, a sudden growth in port scans and ping sweeps
- It does not rely on previous knowledge of existing attacks, and can detect new, undocumented attacks
- But, it is hard to detect normal traffic and unusual traffic
## Secure access method
### Encryption
- ==Encryption is a process that uses an algorithm and a key to code a message written in plain text into ciphertext, which is then transmitted to the recipient==
- Decryption is decoding the ciphertext back into the original plain text using a decryption algorithm and a key
- Encryption is used to protect data from unauthorized access by allowing only authorized users to have the secret key
- It can be used in combination with file permissions so that unauthorized users who is able to bypass file permissions would still be unable to use the accessed data without knowing the secret key
- Cryptography is used for confidentially, authentication, message integrity, and non-repudiation, which is the assurance that someone cannot deny the validity of something
#### Symmetric key encryption
- There is only one key, which is shared by the sender and receiver of a message
- The sender uses the encryption algorithm together with they key to encrypt plaintext
- The receiver then decrypts the ciphertext using the same key
- The sender needs the key to encrypt, but it is difficult to securely deliver the key to the receiver for decryption
#### Public key encryption
- It is a type of encryption that uses a pair of keys to encrypt and decrypt data
- The pair of keys include a public key, which can be shared with anyone, and a private key, which is kept secret by the owner
- The process is initiated by someone who has the public key, which is sent to anyone who is going to partake in encrypted communication
- They also have a private key, which is never sent to anyone
- The sender uses the recipient's public key to encrypt the data, and the recipient then uses their private key to decrypt the data
- This allows for secure communication between two parties, without the need for both parties to have the same secret key
- This eliminates the need to exchange secret keys, which is a challenging process, especially when communicating with multiple parties
### Digital signature
- ==A digital signature authenticates the sender==
- It is a cryptographic technique to indicate the owner or creator of a resource or to signify one's agreement with a document's content in a digital world
- Therefore, it must be possible to prove that a document signed by an individual was indeed signed by that individual and that only that individual could have signed the document
- I.e. the signature cannot be forged and must be verifiable
- Asymmetric encryption allows for the creation of digital signatures, which can be used to verify the authenticity of data
- Using asymmetric encryption, the decryption-encryption works if the keys are used the other way around
- An individual can encrypt a message with a private key, and send this to a recipient who has the corresponding public key, who can then use this to decrypt the ciphertext
- This verifies who the sender is, as only the sender has the private key and the public key only works with that private key
- But, this should not be used with confidential information as anyone can have the public key
#### Public cryptographic one-way hash function
- One may suggest digital signatures can be generated via encryption techniques
- But, encryption and decryption are computationally expensive, and signing data using it can be overkill
- An alternative is to use a public cryptographic one-way hash function which creates a fixed length hash that is uniquely defined for that message, called a 'digest'
- The private key is used to encrypt the digest, making it the digital signature
- The message can be transmitted as plain text together with the encrypted digest as a separate file
- As the digest is much smaller than the whole message, the encryption and transmission are faster processes than if the whole message was encrypted
![[Pasted image 20240526174840.png]]
- At the receiver end, the same public one-way hash function is then used to create a digest from the received message
- The encrypted version of the original digest is decrypted using the public key
- If the two digests are identical, the receiver can be confident that the message is authentic and has been transmitted unaltered
### Summary
1. The sender uses a hash algorithm to create a hashed version of the message
2. The sender uses its private key to encrypt the hash to the digital signature
3. Both the message (encrypted or not) and the digital signature are sent to the receiver
4. The receiver uses the sender’s public key to decrypt the digital signature back to the sender’s version of hash
5. The receiver uses the same hash algorithm to create a new hash from the received message. 
6. If the two hashes match, it means the data is not altered and is sent by the known sender
### Authentication
- ==End-point authentication is the process of one entity proving its identity to another over a computer network==
- This is different from proving that a message received at one point came from the claimed sender
- Often, network elements like routers and client/ server processes must authenticate each other
- Authentication must be done solely on the basis of messages and the data exchanged as part of an authentication protocol
- Typically, an authentication protocol would run before the two communication parties run some other protocol
- The authentication protocol establishes the identities of the parties to each other's satisfaction, before they get down to the work at hand
- Common ways of encryption include passwords, biometrics, and token values
- 2FA uses two different ways of encryption for better security
