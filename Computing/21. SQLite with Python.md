## Connecting to the SQLite database
```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- If `school.db` does not exist, an empty school.db database will be created

## Executing statements
```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
connection.execute("""
					CREATE TABLE Student (
						ExamNo INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
						Name TEXT,
						Class Text
					)
				   """)
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- We can also store statements as a variable
```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
statement = """
			CREATE TABLE Student (
				ExamNo INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
				Name TEXT,
				Class Text
			);
		   """
connection.execute(statement)
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- But, if we try to run the program again, we will get an error as we are creating a table that already exists
- This can be solved by `IF NOT EXISTS`
```PYTHON
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
statement = """
			CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS Student (
				ExamNo INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
				Name TEXT,
				Class Text
			);
			"""
connection.execute(statement)
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
### Insert
```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
statement = """
			INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
			VALUES (2150601, 'Jack Neo', 2156);
			"""
connection.execute(statement)
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- We can include `OR IGNORE` `OR REPLACE` when inserting records to avoid errors

```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
statement = """
			INSERT OR IGNORE INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
			VALUES (2150601, 'Jack Neo', 2156);
			"""
connection.execute(statement)
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- But when we open `student.db` using DB browser, we will find that the records are not inserted as we didn't commit to the database
### Commit and revert

```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
statement = """
			INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
			VALUES (2150601, 'Jack Neo', 2156);
			"""
connection.execute(statement)
connection.commit() #commits changes
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done
```
- We can also revert any changes after the last commit using `rollback()`
```python
import sqlite3
connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db")
connection.execute("""
					INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
					VALUES(2150602, 'Peter Rabbit', '21S56'
				    """)

connection.execute("""
					INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
					VALUES(2150603, 'Bugs Bunny', '21S56'
				    """)

connection.rollback()

connection.execute("""
					INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)"
                   "VALUES(2150602, 'Mark Lee', '21S56'
                   """

connection.commit()

connection.close()
```
## Variables
- We can put in variables into SQL statements using `?`
```python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
ExamNo = int(input())
Name = input()
Class = input
statement = """
			INSERT INTO student(ExamNo, Name, Class)
			VALUES (?, ?, ?);
			""
connection.execute(statement , [ExamNo, Name, Class])
connection.commit() #commits changes
connection.close() # we need to close the database after we are done

```
## Retrieving
```Python
import sqlite3

connection = sqlite3.connect("school.db") #connect to ddatabase
cursor = connection.cursor() # make cursot

cursor.execute("""
				SELECT * FROM Student
				""")
print(cusor.fetchone()) #Fetches first result
print(cusor.fetchall()) #Fetches all results
connection.close() 
```
