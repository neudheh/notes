## Stack
- A stack is an abstract data type which inserts and removes items according to the last in first out principle (LIFO)
- Items can be added at any time
- Only the top item in the stack can be removed

### Implementing
- A stack needs to have these main features
	- `push()` which adds an item to the top of the stack
	- `pop()` which removes and returns an item from the top of the stack
- It can also have
	- `is_empty()` which checks if the stack is empty
	- `size()` which returns the size of the stack
	- `peek()` returns the top item in the stack without removing it
	- `display()` shows all the items in the stack
- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists
## Queue
- A queue is an abstract data type which inserts and removes items according to the first in first out principle
- Items can be inserted at any time, but only the first item, which has been in the queue the longest can be removed
### Implementing
- A queue needs to have these main functions
	- `enqueue()` which adds an item to the back of the queue
	- `dequeue()` which removes an item at the front of the queue
- Other functions it can have
	- `is_empty()` which checks if the queue is empty
	- `size()` which returns the size of the queue
	- `peek()` which displays the next item to be removed without removing it
	- `display()` which displays all the items in the queue
- Queues can be implemented using an array or a linked list
### Circular queue
- In a linear queue, every time an item is dequeued, it will run a loop to shift all the elements to the left to fill up the hole caused by the dequeued element
- This causes it to have the worst case scenario of $O(n)$ time complexity, making it inefficient
- We can have a circular queue, with an array that has two pointers; `front`, which points to the front of the queue, and `rear`, which points to the back of the queue
- A variable `MaxQueueSize` which has the maximum capacity of the queue, is needed
- It is also useful to have an additional variable, `NumberInQueue`, giving the number of elements already in the queue
![[circular queue.png]]
- A circular queue uses the array space efficiently, as when the queue reaches the end of the array, it wraps around to the beginning and uses the unused slots at the front
- This is unlike a linear queue, as once dequeue occurs, the space previously occupied cannot be used
- Once a linear queue is full, enqueueing must pause until it is fully dequeued before it can be used again, leading to slower performance
- But, with the wrap around feature of a circular queue, data packets can be enqueued as long as there is unused space
