## Stack
- A stack is an abstract data type which inserts and removes items according to the last in first out principle (LIFO)
- Items can be added at any time
- Only the top item in the stack can be removed

### Implementing
- A stack needs to have these main functions
	- `push()`, which adds an item to the top of the stack
	- `pop()`, which removes and returns an item from the top of the stack
- Other functions it can have
	- `is_empty()`, which checks if the stack is empty
	- `size()`, which returns the size of the stack
	- `peek()`, which returns the top item of the stack without removing it
	- `display()`, which shows all items in the stack
- Stacks can be implemented using arrays or linked lists
## Queue
- A queue is another abstract data type which inserts and removes items according to the  first in first out principle (FIFO)
- Items can be inserted at any time, but only the first item, which has been in the queue the longest can be removed
