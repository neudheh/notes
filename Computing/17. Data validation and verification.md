## Types of input errors
- Data integrity is the accuracy and validity of data
- A transcription error is when there is a single incorrect character being entered, such as a wrong password or an invalid email address (e.g. Stanley being wrongly entered as Stamley)
- A transcription error is where two characters are accidentally swapped (e.g. S8312345B is entered as S8312354B)
## Data validation
- Data validation is the process of ensuring that the input data satisfies a set of rule such that it is sensible, complete and within acceptable boundaries
- This is to avoid data errors, but does not guarantee that data is accurate
- Techniques include
	- Range check, where it checks if data falls within the accepted range
	- Format check, where it checks if data is in the right format
	- Length check, where it checks if the data is the correct length
	- Presence check, where it checks if data has been entered
	- Check digit, where an extra digit added to the end of a code number, which has been calculated from the digits of the code umber, ensuring it has been correctly entered
## Check digit
- A check digit is a a digit or character added to the end of a code number which has been calculated from the digits of the code number
- This makes the code number with the extra check digit self-checking
- Used in NIRCs, car plates, credit card numbers, and the ISBN of books
### Modulo 11

Steps

1. The digits are given a weight in descending order, such as a 5 digit code having weights of 6, 5, 4, 3, 2
2. Each digit is multiplied by its weight and added together
3. The sum of products is divided by 11 and the remainder is obtained
4. We take 11 - remainder
5. The result is then divided by 11 again, and the check digit is the result. If the check digit is 10, we write X instead

Verifying
1. If the sum of the digits multiplied by their weight, with the check digit multiplied by one, is divisible by 11, it is valid
## Data verification
- Verification is getting the user to confirm that the data entered was what they intended to be entered
- But, it does not check if the data makes sense or is valid
- This can by done by 
	- Double entry, where the user keys in the data twice, and comparing it with the first to ensure it is accurate
	- Proofreading, where someone checks the data against the original source to ensure it matches
## Program testing
- The process of finding and eliminating errors in a program is called debugging
- Errors can be classified into 3 groups, syntax, logical and runtime
### Syntax errors
- Syntax errors are errors when one has not followed the rule of the language
- It will not run
- Spelling errors, missing brackets, semicolons or colons, wrong indentation, undeclared variables
### Logical errors
- Logic errors are hard to fix
- The program wills till run, but it will not behave as expected, giving an incorrect output
- This is caused by a mistake in the programs logic, and you will not get an error message
### Runtime errors
- Runtime errors are errors that cause the program to crash while it is executing
- The program is syntactically correct, has no logic errors, but crashes due to the environment the program is being run in or input provided, causing an error
- Division by zero, recursion, dividing a string by an int, out of a list range

## Test data
- Normal/ Valid - Typical data values that are valid and will be accepted by a system
- Abnormal/ invalid/ errornous - Data values that the program should not accept or should reject
- Extreme/ boundary - Data values that are at the extreme end of the range of normal data that should be accepted

>[!EXAMPLE]
>A progam is to accept scores on a test from 0 - 100
>- Normal: 50,69,75
>- Abnormal: -1, 101
>- Extreme: 0, 100
