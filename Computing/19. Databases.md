- ==A database is a collection of data stored in an organised logical manner, allowing us to access and manage the data==
- A table contains a collection of records
- A record is a complete set of data about a single item
- A table has a number of fields (columns)
- Attributes are the describing characteristics or properties that define all times pertaining to a certain category
- The attribute is basically a header

## Data redundancy
- ==Data redundancy refers to the same data being stored more than once==
- Having to enter data multiple times means that the database is at an increased risk of having inaccurate data
- It would be hard to update because every occurrence of the data will need to be changed, leading to data inconsistency
- This will cause issues when inserting, updating and deleting data from the database
![[Pasted image 20240220221353.png]]
- **Inserting** - A new student from the same `CivicsClass` will need to insert duplicated data into `CivicsTutor`
- **Updating** - If Peter Lim leaves the college, all the records with him as the `CivicsTutor` will need to be updated, and if we miss any there will be data inconsistency
- **Deleting** - If all of the records are deleted, information on `CivicsClass` and `CivicsTutor` will be lost
## Relational database
- ==A relational database is a collection of relational tables where data is organised in one or more tables with relationships between them==
- We can express a table at `Student(RegNo, Name, Gender, CivicsClass, CivicsTutor)`
- A table needs to 
	- Have atomic values (No arrays or other tables; it can only have one piece of info that cannot be broken down further)
	- Have columns of the same kind
	- Have unique rows
	- The order columns is insignificant
	- Each column must have a unique name
### Keys
- ==A key is a combination of one or more columns that uniquely identifies a row in a table==
- They allow for the establishment and identification of relationships between tables 
- They help to enforce identity and integrity in the relationship
#### Candidate keys
- ==A candidate key is a minimal set of fields that can uniquely identify each record in a table==
- Cannot be Null or empty
- There can be more than one candidate key in a table
- It can be a combination of more than one field
#### Primary keys
- ==A primary key is a field or set of fields in a table whose value uniquely identifies each record in the table==
- It should not change over time
- It is also the candidate key that is most appropriate to become the main key for the table
- There can only be one primary key
#### Composite primary keys
- A composite primary key is a combination of two or more fields that can be used to uniquely identify each record in a table
- Uniqueness is only guaranteed when the fields are combined
- When taken individually, the fields do not guarantee uniqueness

#### Secondary keys
- Candidate keys that are not selected as primary keys are secondary keys
![[Pasted image 20240220230133.png]]
#### Foreign keys
- Foreign key is an attribute that refers to the primary key in another table

## Normalisation
- Normalisation is organising the tables to reduce data redundancy and prevent inconsistent data
### First normal form (1NF)
- For a table to be in 1NF, all the values must be atomic (no arrays or other tables; only contain one piece of info which cannot be broken down further)
![[Pasted image 20240220232416.png]]
 - This is not 1NF, as CCA info can be split into two columns, CCAs and the teacher in charge
 ![[Pasted image 20240220232502.png]]
### Second normal form (2NF)
- For a table to be in 2NF, it needs to be in 1NF, and every other non-key attribute must depend on the primary key (functionally dependent)
![[Pasted image 20240220232502.png]]
- This is not 2NF as `CCATeacherIC` only depends on `CCAname`
- `CivicsClass`, `CivicsTutor`, `Homeroom`, `Name`, `Gender` depend on part of the primary key
![[Pasted image 20240220233332.png]]
## Third normal form (3NF)
- For a table to be in 3NF, it must be in 2NF and cannot be transitively dependent (e.g. X depends on Y, and Y depends on Z, so X is transitively depended on X)
- X depending on Y does not imply the reverse
![[Pasted image 20240220233332.png]]
- This is not in 3NF, as `CivicsTutor` and `HomeRoom` depend on `CivicsClass`, and `CivicsClass` depends on `MatricNo`, hence there is a transitive dependency

## Entity-relationship diagram
- An entity is an object of interest (usually indicating a table in a database)
- Collective nouns or nouns are used to name entities
- They are represented by rectangles
- Relationships describe a link between two entities
### One-to-one
- A one-to-one relationship means that one record in a table relates to a single record in another table and vice-versa
- One ticket can only have one concert hall seat, and one concert hall seat can only belong to one ticket
![[Pasted image 20240220233945.png]]
### One-to-many
- A one-to-many relationships means that one record in table can relate to multiple records in another table
- But, this means that in the other table, one record in the table can only refer to one record in the previous table
- One class can have many students, but one student can only have one class
![[Pasted image 20240220234122.png]]
### Many-to-many
- Many-to-many means that one record in a table and relate to multiple records in another table and vice-versa
- One student can have many CCAs, and one CCA can have many students
![[Pasted image 20240220234219.png]]
- Many-to-many is hard to implement as it may indicate transitive dependencies that must be removed for 3NF
- E-R diagrams can then be directly translated into database designs
