## Applications
### Native applications
- Native applications are installed directly on the device that can work with no internet connection depending on the nature of the application
- They are developed for a specific platform or operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows)
- They can take advantage of device features such as the power of the processor, specific hardware such as the GPS and other components of the system such as notifications
- More safe and secure than web apps, as they must be approved by the app store
### Web applications
- Web applications are a software application accessed and used through a web browser, an application that is used to browse the internet
- Users do not need to download and install web applications on their device
- They can be accessed by any device with a web browser and an internet connection, regardless of the operating system
- They are developed as web pages in HTML and CSS, while interactive components of the application are developed in programming languages such as JavaScript

## Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability principles
- User interface (UI) refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons and other visual elements that users interact when using a website or app
- User experience (UX) refers to the interactions users have with a product, including how feel about the interaction
### 1. Visibility of system status
- The application design should always update users on the system's current status clearly
- Prompt and meaningful feedback should be provided so that users can determine the next steps
- This will build trust in the system
- E.g. Loading bars
### 2. Match between system and the real world
- Terms, icons, images, concepts, and words should be familiar to the user rather than system oriented terms
- This can be done by following real world conventions so that the information can appear in a natural and logical order, which leads to desired outcomes, 
- This is known as natural mapping
- Users can easily learn how to use the interface, enhancing user experience
### 3. User control and freedom
- Accommodate user's mistakes by allowing them to undo and redo easily
- Provide users a clear way to exit any unwanted state or interaction
- This gives users a sense of freedom and control and avoids frustration of getting stuck at a certain state
### 4. Consistency and standards
- It is also important to improve user's learnability by ensuring internal and external consistency in using words symbols and actions
- Internal consistency refers to ensuring that your application follows consistent convention and design patterns throughout the interface, 
- E.g. using the same button styles and colors for similar actions within a product
- External consistency refers to following industry conventions
- Users spend more time using other apps, and have expectations of your app
- Failing to maintain this consistency would increase the cognitive load of the user as they are forced to learn something new or opposite of what they are used to
### 5. Error prevention
- Web apps should be designed in a way to prevent potential problems
- This can be done by eliminating error-prone conditions or confirming with the users before they commit to an actions
- Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention
- They can be prevented by providing helpful constraints and good defaults 
- Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between a users mental model and the design
- This can be prevented by letting users undo an action, or warning or notifying users before they execute the actions
- They must minimize the user memory load to lower the probability of them making a mistake
### 6. Recognition rather than recall
- Humans have limited short term memories, and interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users
- User's memory load can be minimized by making the elements, actions, and options in application visible and easily retrievable
- The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another
- E.g. Place a label next to an button, making it it visible and easily retrievable
### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Allow more experienced users a faster and more efficient experience
- This can be done through keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures that are hidden from novice users
- Users can personalize how they interact with the application by customizing or tailoring their frequent actions, content, and other functionality
- This cane be done by letting users select how they want the product to work
### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- The content and visual interface of the UI should focus on the essentials, and not contain irrelevant content or rarely needed information
- Every extra unit of information competes with other units of information and reduces their visibility
- It is important to not distract users with unnecessary elements and ensure they support the users primary goals
### 9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Helpful error messages are vital in web application
- They should attract users immediate attention by ensuring that the error messages follow the traditional visuals such as bold red text
- They should be expressed in simple language and not in error codes or technical jargon
- They should indicate the problem and suggest constructive suggestions to solve the problem
### 10. Help and documentation
- Help and documentation helps users understand how to use the app, and how to complete their tasks
- These should be easy to search and tailor to the context they are in
- They should be concise by listing the concrete steps that need to be taken
## ASCII
- ASCII uses only 7 bits to represent 128 characters
- Hexadecimal digits are often used to express ASCII codes as only 2 hexadecimal digits are needed, which is more compact than 3 denary digits or 7 binary digits
## Unicode
- Unicode provides a number for every character, no matter what the platform, program or language is
- Used to represent languages like Tamil and Mandarin
- Unicode uses 8 up to 32 bits to represent characters, allowing it to represent over a million characters
- If Unicode numbers were stored as binary numbers, each character needs 21 binary digits, using 21 bits
- This is wasteful, as not all characters are used equally often
- But, frequently used character use fewer bits, while rarely used one use more bits, hence they use 8 to 32 bits
