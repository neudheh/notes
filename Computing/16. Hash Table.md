- A hash table is a data structure that stores data in an array and has direct access to the records
- An address (the array index) is calculated from the key value of the data and the data is then stored at this address in the array
- To search for data, the address is calculated from the key and we can look up the array using the calculated address to find the data
- Calculating an address from a key is called hashing
- A key, which could be part of the data item or the entire data item, is parsed into a hash function to generate an address, which points to a location in the array, where the data is stored
## Implementing
- To implement a hash table, we will need a hash table, and a hash function
- A hash table holds all the data entries in an array, using a python list
- The size of the array should be set according to the amount of data expected
- A hash function is an algorithm that converts a key to a value which is the address/ index
- A hash function
	- Always produce the same hash value for the same key
	- Provide a uniform distribution of hash value (every value has an equal probability of being generated)
	- Minimise clustering, where many different keys produce the same hash value
	- Be very fast to compute
### Defining a hash function
- Some common hash functions include using the modulus of the key by the size of the array + 1
```Python
def hash(key):
	return key % (array_size + 1)
```
### Insert, search and delete functions
```Python
def insert(key):
	address = hash(key):
	hash_table[address] = key

def search(key):
	address = hash(key):
	if hash_table[address] == key:
		print(f"Found {key} at index {address}")
	else:
		print(f"{key} not found!")

def delete(key):
	address = hash(key):
	if hash_table[address] == key:
		print(f"Deleted {hash_table.pop(address)}")
	else:
		print(f"{key} not found!")
```
- The time complexity to search, insert and delete data in a hash table is $O(1)$
## Collisions
- Collisions when two or more keys have the same address
- We can handle collisions in two ways
### Closed addressing
- When there is a collision, we can used a linked list to store both items in the same address
- This is known as separate chaining

- It is easy to implement
- If an element is present in the hash table, it will only be found inside the linked list at its key
- Deletion is also quick and simple
- But, it leads to inefficient use of memory as some addresses might never be used at all, but still have been allocated space in the table
- We also need more memory to store the elements as nodes in the linked list
- Chining can also lead to the worst case time complexity of $O(n)$ while searching
### Open addressing
- When collision is detected, data will be stored in the next available location in the array
- This means that we are unable to add more data in an array if the hash table is full
- It is highly efficient in memory use as elements are stored in the space already allocated for the hash table, and no extra memory is wasted
- But, searching is slower due to clustering
- Searching will have a worst case scenario of $O(n)$ as we will have to check every cell in the hash table to determine if the item is in the hash table or not
