- Object oriented programming (OOP) is a form of programming that groups the variables and subroutines that operate on the variables in one place
- This is so that only these subroutines can access the data items
- The variables of an object are called attributes/ properties
- The subroutines acting on these attributes are called methods
- Object-oriented programming consists of classes and objects
## Classes
- A class is a blueprint/ template that contains attributes or properties which describes the variables and methods which can access the variables
- We can create one or more objects of a class type from a class, known as instantiation
- The object will have the same attributes and methods as the class it was created from
- Think of a class as a cookie cutter, while an object as a cookie. When we want to make an cookie, we use the cookie cutter to shape it and its properties
### Class diagrams
- A class can be represented using a class diagram
- It is made up of 3 sections; the class name, attributes and methods

| **Class** |
|-|
|Properties|
|Methods|
- For example, this is a person class
![[class diagram.png]]
- This is how it would be defined in python
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no
```
- Python uses constructors (`__init__`) to make a object. When a object is made, the constructor is automatically called
- The first input parameter must have `self`, which refers to the object that is made using the class
- To make an object, we simply call the class, along with the parameters we want to pass to it
```Python
#main
p1 = Person("John", "91234567")
print(p1)
```
```Terminal
<__main__.Person object at 0x000001CA655F7B8>
```
- We can write methods in the class to help us interact with the object
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no

	# method
	def get_name(self)
		return self.name

p1 = Person("John", "91234567")
print(p1.name)
```
```Terminal
John
```
- All methods need the `self` parameter
- When calling the method, we do not need to specify the self parameter, as Python will include it automatically
### Class attributes and object attributes
- Class attributes are attributes which belong to the class instead of a particular object
- Changing a class attribute is like changing the shape of the cookie cutter
```python
class Customer:
	current_serial = 0
	
	def __init__(self):
		# type(self).current_serial refers to the current 
		# serial in the class
		# type(self) just points to the customer class, as the  
		# object type for any instance is Customer
		# We can also use Customer.current_serial to do the same
		# thing
		type(self).current_serial += 1
		self.serial = Customer.current_serial

c1 = Customer()
c2 = Customer()
c3 = Customer()
print(c1.serial)
print(c2.serial)	
print(c3.serial)
# current_serial points to the class, while serial points to the 
# serial number of each object
print(Customer.current_serial, c1.current_serial, c2.current_serial)
```
```Terminal
1
2
3
3 3 3
```
- Instance attributes are attributes which belongs to the particular object instead of the class
- Changing an object attribute is like changing only one cookie
```Python
# over here we are changing the class attribute
class A:
	cls_attr = "class attribute"

x = A()
print(x.cls_attr)
A.cls_attr = "my value"
print(x.cls_attr)
print(A.cls_attr)
```
```Terminal
class attribute
my value
my value
```
```Python
# over here we are changing the object attribute
class A:
	cls_attr = "class attribute"

x = A()
print(x.cls_attr)
x.cls_attr = "my value"
print(x.cls_attr)
print(A.cls_attr)
```
```Terminal
class attribute
my value
class attribute
```
## Encapsulation
- One benefit of OOP is that we can have "public" and "private" methods and attributes
- "Public" means that these attributes and methods are easily accessible
- "Private" means that there is no direct path to the attributes and methods
- In a class diagram, a negative sign denotes a private attribute/ method and a positive prefix denotes a public attribute
- Attributes and methods are combined into a single class and ensuring that the private properties can only be assessed/altered by calls to the public methods
- It is preferred over procedural programming in game design, whereby attributes and methods are all separate entities
![[public private class diagram.png]]
- All variables should be tagged with negative signs to signify that they are private attributes and methods should be tagged with positive signs to signify they are public methods
### Getters and Setters
- Methods used to get the attributes of an object are called getters
- Methods used to set the attributes of an object are called setters
- Attributes that are set only at initialization, and do not need to be changed, hence they do not need setters
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no
	# getters
	def get_name(self):
		return self.name
	def get_mobile_no(self):
		return self.mobile_no
	# setters
	def set_name(self, name):
		self.name = name
	def set_mobile_no(self, mobile_no):
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no
```
- Private attributes can be declared by putting an underscore before the attribute name
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self._name = name
		self._mobile_no = mobile_no
```
>[!NOTE]
>In Python, there are no private attributes, everything is available to all users
>The underscore is there to just say I'm private and hope the users fuck off
## Inheritance
- Inheritance is when the attributes and methods from the superclass are used as a basis for the subclasses
- It promotes software reuse since existing code would have already been tested. 
- A class (subclass) can inherit the methods and attributes of another class (superclass/ base class)
- For example, in a school, there are two types of people; teachers and students
- They both have names and mobile numbers
- But, students belong to classes while teachers belong to departments
- This is one way to organize the both of them
![[student teacher subclasses.png]]
- Class diagrams with inheritance always have the superclass (base class) at the top, and subclasses at the bottom
- The direction of inheritance is from subclasses to superclass
- To inherit a class in python, we define the sub class by using `class subclass(superclass)`
## Polymorphism
- Polymorphism is when the methods in the subclasses have the same name and methods in the superclass but behave differently
- All attributes and methods are inherited from the parent class to the subclass
- The same methods can be redefined and used in different ways, depending on the data in the subclasses
- We can override the methods in the superclass, through method overriding
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no

	
	def display(self):
		print(f"Name: {self.name}\nMobile_no{self.mobile_no}")

class Student(Person) # inheritance??!?!?
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no, c_class):
		# method overriding
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no
		self.c_class = c_class

	# method overriding
	def display(self):
		print(f"Name: {self.name}\nMobile no: {self.mobile_no}\n\
		Class: {self.c_class}")
```
- We can also call methods in the superclass that has been overridden by the subclasses using `super()` to cut down on code duplication
- We need to pass the parameters in the function too
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no

	def display(self):
		print(f"Name: {self.name}")
		print(f"Mobile no: {self.mobile_no}")

class Student(Person) # inheritance??!?!?
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no, c_class):
		# method overriding
		super().__init__(name, mobile_no)
		self.c_class = c_class

	def display(self):
		super().display()
		print(f"Class: {self.c_class}")

```

- The class diagram for polymorphism would be different, sine we are redefining the function
