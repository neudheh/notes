- Object oriented programming (OOP) is a form of programming that groups the variables and subroutines that operate on the variables in one place
- This is so that only these subroutines can access the data items
- The variables of an object are called attributes/ properties
- The subroutines acting on these attributes are called methods
- Object-oriented programming consists of classes and objects
## Classes
- A class is a blueprint/ template that contains attributes or properties which describes the variables and methods which can access the variables
- We can create one or more objects of a class type from a class, known as instantiation
- The object will have the same attributes and methods as the class it was created from
- Think of a class as a cookie cutter, while an object as a cookie. When we want to make an cookie, we use the cookie cutter to shape it and its properties
### Class diagrams
- A class can be represented using a class diagram
- It is made up of 3 sections; the class name, attributes and methods

| **Class** |
|-|
|Properties|
|Methods|
- For example, this is a person class
![[class diagram.png]]
- This is how it would be defined in python
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no
```
- Python uses constructors (`__init__`) to make a object. When a object is made, the constructor is automatically called
- The first input parameter must have `self`, which refers to the object that is made using the class
- To make an object, we simply call the class, along with the parameters we want to pass to it
```Python
#main
p1 = Person("John", "91234567")
print(p1)
```
```Terminal
<__main__.Person object at 0x000001CA655F7B8>
```
- We can write methods in the class to help us interact with the object
```Python
class Person:
	# constructor
	def __init__(self, name, mobile_no)
		self.name = name
		self.mobile_no = mobile_no

	# method
	def get_name(self)
		return self.name

p1 = Person("John", "91234567")
print(p1.name)
```
```Terminal
John
```
- All methods need the `self` parameter
- When calling the method, we do not need to specify the self parameter, as Python will include it automatically
### Class attributes and object attributes
- Class attributes are attributes which belong to the class instead of a particular object
- Changing a class attribute is like changing the shape of the cookie cutter
```python
class Customer:
	current_serial = 0
	
	def __init__(self):
		# type(self).current_serial refers to the current 
		# serial in the class
		# type(self) just points to the customer class, as the  
		# object type for any instance is Customer
		# We can also use Customer.current_serial to do the same
		# thing
		type(self).current_serial += 1
		self.serial = Customer.current_serial

c1 = Customer()
c2 = Customer()
c3 = Customer()
print(c1.serial)
print(c2.serial)	
print(c3.serial)
# current_serial points to the class, while serial points to the 
# serial number of each object
print(Customer.current_serial, c1.current_serial, c2.current_serial)
```
```Terminal
1
2
3
3 3 3
```
- Instance attributes are attributes which belongs to the particular object instead of the class
- Changing an object attribute is like changing only one cookie
```Python
# over here we are changing the class attribute
class A:
	cls_attr = "class attribute"

x = A()
print(x.cls_attr)
A.cls_attr = "my value"
print(x.cls_attr)
print(A.cls_attr)
```
```Terminal
class attribute
my value
my value
```
```Python
# over here we are changing the object attribute
class A:
	cls_attr = "class attribute"

x = A()
print(x.cls_attr)
x.cls_attr = "my value"
print(x.cls_attr)
print(A.cls_attr)
```
```Terminal
class attribute
my value
class attribute
```
## Encapsulation
- One benefit of OOP is that we can have "public" and "private" methods and attributes
- "Public" means that these attributes and methods are easily accessible
- "Private" means that there is no direct path to the attributes and methods
- In a class diagram, a negative sign denotes a private attribute/ method and a positive prefix denotes a public attribute

- All 
## Inheritance

## Polymorphism
