## Algorithm
- ==An algorithm is a step-by-step procedure with well defined instructions to solve a give problem==
## Constructs
### Sequence construct
- A sequence construct involves performing multiple instructions in a fixed order
- It is important to ensure the algorithm works well as intended
- Any other order and the algorithm will produce unintended results

### Selection construct
- A selection construct involves choosing between two or more branches based on a particular condition
- Selection is the process of making a decision
- Selection allows us to include more than one path in an algorithm
- Some steps are performed under certain conditions, otherwise different steps (or no steps) are performed
- Two branches usually follow from a selection

## Iteration construct
- An iteration construct involves repeating instructions while a particular condition is true
- An iteration, a.k.a a loop, allows an algorithm to repeat certain steps until told to stop or a particular condition is met
- It allows to simplify an algorithm by removing repetitive steps

## if statements
- An `if` statement is a selection construct that is used to check a condition
```Python
if password == "xiaosleftnut":
	print("access granted")
```
- We can add an `else` to do something else if the initial condition is not met
```Python
if password == "xiaosleftnut":
	print("access granted")
else:
	print("access denied")
```
- We can also add `elif`, which is short for else if, and is another condition that is checked
```Python
if password == "xiaosleftnut":
	print("access granted")
elif password == "xiaosrightnut":
	print("access granted")
else:
	print("access denied")
```
## while loops
- A `while` loop runs the code while the condition is true
```Python
count = 1 
while count <= 5:
	print(count)
	count += 1
```

```Terminal
1
2
3
4
5
```
## for loops
- A `for` loop loops over the items in the sequence
- A sequence can be a string, an array, or a range
- It needs an iterating variable, which represents the current element of the sequence it is on
```Python
for i in "xiao":
	print(i)
```
```Terminal
x # i = x
i # i = i
a # i = a
o # i = o
```
- The `range(a,b)` function generates an array of numbers from `a` inclusive and `b` exclusive
- If `a` is not specified, it starts from 0
```Python
for i in range(3):
	print(i)
print("")
for i in range(1,3):
	print(i)
```
```Terminal
0
1
2

1
2
```
## continue, break, and pass
- `continue` ends the current iteration of the loop and continues with the next
```Python
for i in range(5)
	if i == 3:
		continue
	print(i)
```
```Terminal
1
2
4
```
- `break` ends the loop
```Python
for i in "miles morales"
	if i == " ":
		break
	print(i)
```
```Terminal
m
i
l
e
s
```
- `pass` acts s a placeholder when we don't know what to code inside of the condition

```Python
for i in "spidergwen"
	if i == "g":
		pass
	print(i)
```
```Terminal
s
p
i
d
e
r
g
w
e
n
```
