## Abstract data types
- An abstract data type is a collection of data, with these operations
	- Create a new instance of the data structure (make the data structure)
	- Insert a new element into the data structure
	- Delete an element in the data structure
	- Find/ update an element in the data structure
	- Abstract data types use dynamic memory allocation
## Arrays
- An array is a collection of times that are stored at contiguous (adjacent) memory locations
- It can only hold a fixed number of times, and these items should be of the same type
## Linked lists
- A linked list is a dynamic data structure, which holds a collection of elements
- Each element may not be stored in contiguous memory location but at whatever location is available
- Each elements are linked into an ordered sequence using pointers
- A linked list is better as each adding or deleting operation doesn't require us to shift each item, we only need to change the pointers, and everything can be done in $O(1)$ complexity
## Nodes
- An element in the list is called a node
- Each node has data and a pointer which points to the next element
- A pointer that does not point to anything, indicating no further elements, is called a null pointer
- Represented by $\emptyset$
- The start/ head of a pointer stores the address of the first element of the linked list
### Singly linked list
- A single linked list is a collection of nodes, each with one pointer pointing to the next node
- The start pointer points to the first node, and the pointer in the last node points to $\emptyset$
- When the list is empty, the start pointer points to $\emptyset$
- We can only travel forward along the list
## Creating a linked list
- To create a node, with a `data` and a `next` pointer
![[linked list node.png]]
```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.next = None
```
- To initialise the linked list,
```Python
class LinkedList:
	def __init__(self):
		self.start = None
```
- We create a `start` pointer, and set it to none as the linked list is empty
## Inserting a node

### At the beginning
![[linked list inserting a new node at the beginning.png]]
### At the end
![[linked list inserting a new node at the end.png]]
### In between
![[linked list inserting a node in between.png]]
```Python
# ordered linked list
def insert(self, data):
	# creating the new node
	new_node = Node(data)

	#empty linked list
	if self.start == None: 
		self.start = new_node
		return
	#adding at the beginning
	if self.start.data > data:
		new_node.next = self.start
		self.start = new_node
		return

	#travelling through the linked list
	current = self.start
	previous = current
	while current != None and current.data < data:
		previous = current
		current = current.next

	#adding at the end
	if current == None:
		previous.next = new_node
		return
	# adding in between
	new_node.next = current
	previous.next = new_node
```
## Deleting a node
### Deleting first node
- To delete the first node, we just set start to the next node
![[linked list deleting first node.png]]
### Deleting last node
- To delete the last node, we set the 2nd last node to none
![[linked list deleting last node.png]]
### Deleting node in between
- To delete the node in between, set the pointer of the previous node (B) to the pointer of the current node (D)
![[linked list deleting node in between.png]]
```python
def delete(self, data):
	# error if the linked list is empty
	if self.start == None:
		print("The linked list is empty!")
		return
	# adding at the start
	if data < self.start.data :
		self.start = self.start.next
		return

	# traversing through the linked list
	current = self.start
	previous = current
	while current != None and current.data < data:
		previous = current
		current = current.next

	# data does not exist in the linked list
	if current == None:
		print("The data does not exist in the linked list!")
		return
	# deleting data at the end / in between
	previous.next = current.next
```
## Searching through a linked list
```python
def search(self, data):
	# traversing through the linked list
	current = self.start
	previous = current
	while current != None and current.data < data:
		previous = current
		current = current.next

	# data does not exist in the linked list
	if current == None: 
		print("The data does not exist in the linked list!")
		return

	print("Data found")
```
## Accessing all nodes in the linked list
```python
def display(self):
	if self.start == None:
		print("The linked list is empty")
		return
	current = self.start
	while current != None:
		print(current.data)
		current = current.next
	
```
## Free space list
- When a node is deleted, it will remain in the array/ memory and no longer will be accessible as there is no pointer pointing to it
- This space, which is free, will be wasted
- A free space list helps to free up deleted nodes, and releasing memory
- It keeps two linked lists, one for the actual data and one for empty nodes
![[free space list.png]]
- New nodes can be created by using the unused notes and deleted nodes will be returned to the free space list and can be reused again
### Inserting data
![[free space list inserting.png]]
1. Check if there are any unused nodes in the linked list
2. Set a `temp` to point to the `nextfree` pointer
3. Store the data at the the `nextfree` node
4. Set `nextfree` to be the next free node
5. Traverse the linked list to the correct position to insert the new node
6. Insert the new node
### Deleting data
1. Check if the linked list is empty
2. Traverse the linked list and find if the data exists in the node
3. Clear the node with the data
4. Set the deleted nodes pointer to `nextfree`
5. Set `nextfree` to the deleted node
![[free space list deleting.png]]
## Memory allocation
- Memory allocation is the process by which programs are assigned with physical or virtual memory space

|Static Memory Allocation| Dynamic memory Allocation|
|-|-|
|Memory is allocated at compile time| Memory is allocated at run time|
| The size and location of memory blocks are fixed and cannot be changed at runtime| The size and location of memory blocks can be changed according to the program logic and data size|
| Allocated memory remains from start to end of the program| Allocated memory can be released at any time during the program|
|Inflexible and wasteful if actual memory usage is less than allocated| Flexible and efficient as memory is allocated according to required usage|
|Fast and simple as there is no need to allocate or deallocate memory during execution, and it avoids memory fragmentation, as memory blocks are contiguous and aligned|Slower as more complex, as you have to manage the memory allocation and deallocation yourself, and may cause memory fragmentation|
|Preferred in arrays| Preferred in linked lists|
