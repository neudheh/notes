## Abstract data types
- An abstract data type is a collection of data, with these operations
- Create a new instance of the data structure (make the data structure)
- Insert a new element into the data structure
- Delete an element in the data structure
- Find/ update an element in the data structure
- Abstract data types use dynamic memory allocation
## Arrays
- An array is a collection of items that are stored at contiguous (adjacent) memory locations
- It can only hold a fixed number of items, and these items should be of the same type
## Linked lists
- A linked list is a dynamic data structure, which holds a collection of elements
- Each element may not be stored in contiguous memory locations but at whatever location is available 
- Each element is linked into an ordered sequence using pointers
- A linked list is better as adding or deleting doesn’t require us to shift each item, we only need to change the pointers and everything can be done in $O(1)$ complexity
## Nodes
- An element in a linked list is called a node
- Each node has data and a pointer which points to the next element
- A pointer that does not point to anything, indicating no further events is called a null pointer, it is represented by $\emptyset$
- The start/ head of a pointer stores the address of the first element of the linked list
### Singly linked list
- A singly linked list is a collection of nodes, each with one pointer pointing to the next node
- The start pointer points to the first node, and the last pointer points to $\emptyset$
- When the list is empty, the start pointer points to $\emptyset$
- We can only travel forward along the list
## Creating a linked list
- Create a node with a `data` and a `next` pointer which points to the next node in the list 
![[linked list node.png]]
```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
	self.data = data
	self.next = None
```
- To initialise the linked list,
```Python
class LinkedList:
	def __init__(self):
		self.start = None
```
- We create a `start` pointer, and set it to none as the linked list is empty
## Inserting a node
### At the beginning
- The `next` in the new node has to point to the contents of the `Start` pointer
- The `Start` pointer then points to the new node
![[linked list inserting a new node at the beginning.png]]
### At the end
- The pointer of the last node points to the new node
- The pointer of the new node is a null pointer
![[linked list inserting a new node at the end.png]]
### In between
- The pointer of the new node has point to the next node
- The pointer of the previous node then points to the new node
![[linked list inserting a node in between.png]]```
```pseudo
PROCEDURE insert(self, data)
	// Create a node object
	new_node <- Node(data)
	IF self.start IS NONE // linked list is empty	
		THEN
			self.start <- new_node
		ELSE // find insertion point
			current <- self.start
			WHILE current IS NOT NONE AND current.data < data DO
				previous <- current
				current <- current.next
			ENDWHILE
			IF previous == current // insert at the start of the list
				THEN
					new_node.next <- self.start
					self.start <- new_node
				ELSE
					IF current IS NONE // insert at the end of the list
						THEN
							previous.next <- new_node
						ELSE // insert in between
							previous.next <- new_node
							new_node.next <- current 
					ENDIF
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Deleting a node
### At the start
- To delete a node at the start, update the start pointer to the next pointer
![[linked list deleting first node.png]]
### At the end
- To delete a node at the end, update the pointer of the node before the last node to be a null pointer
![[linked list deleting last node.png]]
### In between
- To delete a node in between, make the node before the node to be deleted point to the node after
![[linked list deleting node in between.png]]
```pseudo 
PROCEDURE delete (self, data)
	IF self.start IS NONE
		THEN
			OUTPUT “Linked list is empty”
		ELSE
			current <- self.start
			WHILE current IS NOT NONE AND current.data <> data DO
				previous <- current
				current <- current.next
			ENDWHILE
			IF current IS NONE
				THEN
					OUTPUT “Data does not exist"
				ELSE
					IF current = self.start // start of linked list
						THEN
							self.start <- current.next
						ELSE
							prev.next <- current.next
					ENDIF
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Searching for data
```pseudo
FUNCTION search(self, data)
    IF self.start IS NONE
        THEN
            OUTPUT “Linked list is empty”
            RETURN FALSE
        ELSE
            current <- self.start
            WHILE current IS NOT NONE AND current.data < data DO
                current <- current.next
            ENDWHILE
            IF current IS NONE
                THEN
                    OUTPUT “Data not found”
                    RETURN FALSE
                ELSE
                    OUTPUT “Data found
                    RETURN TRUE
                ENDIF
    ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Access all nodes in the linked lsit
```pseudo
PROCEDURE display(self)
    IF self.start IS NONE
        THEN
            OUTPUT “Linked list is empty”
        ELSE
            current <- self.start
            WHILE CURRENT IS NOT NONE DO
                OUTPUT current.data
                current <- current.next
            ENDWHILE
    ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Free space list
- But, nodes that are deleted will remain in the array and no longer be accessible as no pointer will point to it
- This space, which is free, is wasted
- One way of managing this is to have two linked lists; one for the actual data, and one for free space
- A free space list can be made by linking unused nodes 
- New nodes can be made by using the unused nodes and nodes that are deleted are returned to the free space list
![[free space list.png]]
### Insertion
1. Check if there is any unused nodes in the free space list
2. Set a `new_node_pointer` to point to the index that the `next_free` pointer is pointing to
3. Store the data into the new node at the index that `new_node_pointer` is pointing to
4. Set `next_free` pointer to point to the index of the new free node
5. Traverse the linked list to find the correct position to insert the new node
6. To insert at the start of the linked list, set the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the contents of the `start` pointer, then update the `start` pointer to point to the new node
7. To insert in between, set the new pointer of the new node to point to the index of the next node, and the previous node points to the index of the new node
![[free space list inserting.png]]
### Deleting a node
1. Check if the linked list is empty
2. Traverse the linked list and find if the data exists in the nodes
3. To delete the first node,
	- Set the start pointer to the index of the `next` pointer in the node to be deleted
	- Update the `next` pointer in the node to be deleted to the index in the `nextfree` pointer
	- Update `nextfree` to point to the new node 
1. To delete a node in the linked list
	- Set the `next` pointer of the previous node to point to the index in the `next` pointer of the node to be deleted
	- Update the `next` pointer in the node to be deleted to the index in the `nextfree` pointer
	- Update `nextfree` to point to the new node
## Memory allocation
- Memory allocation is the process where computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space
- The memory allocation is done before or at the time of program execution
- There are two types; static memory allocation, and dynamic memory allocation

| Static memory allocation                                                                    | Dynamic memory allocation                                                                              |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Memory is allocated at compile time                                                         | Memory is allocated at run time                                                                        |
| The size and location of memory blocks is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime            | The size and location of memory blocks can be changed and allocated to the program logic and data size |
| Allocated memory remains from start to end of the program                                   | Allocated memory can be released at any time during the program                                        |
| It is inflexible and wasteful if actual memory usage is less than allocated                 | It is flexible and efficient as memory is allocated according to required usage                        |
| It is fast and simple as there is no need to allocate or deallocate memory during execution | It is slower and more complex as you have to manage the memory allocation and deallocation yourself    |
| Avoids memory fragmentation as memory blocks are contiguous and aligned                     | May cause memory fragmentation                                                                         |
| Preferred in arrays                                                                         | Preferred in linked lists                                                                              |
