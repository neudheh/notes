## Abstract data types
- An abstract data type is a collection of data, with these operations
	- Create a new instance of the data structure (make the data structure)
	- Insert a new element into the data structure
	- Delete an element in the data structure
	- Find/ update an element in the data structure
	- Abstract data types use dynamic memory allocation
## Memory allocation
- Memory allocation is the process by which programs are assigned with physical or virtual memory space

|Static Memory Allocation| Dynamic memory Allocation|
|-|-|
|Memory is allocated at compile time| Memory is allocated at run time|
| The size and location of memory blocks are fixed and cannot be changed at runtime| The size and location of memory blocks can be changed according to the program logic and data size|
| Allocated memory remains from start to end of the program| Allocated memory can be released at any time during the program|
|Inflexible and wasteful if actual memory usage is less than allocated| Flexible and efficient as memory is allocated according to required usage|
