## Subroutines
- Subroutines allow us to manage and structure our programs, allowing us to break up our programs into smaller chunks of code
- This is called modular design
- There are two types of subroutines: functions, which returns an output, and procedures, which do not return output
## Advantages
### Organisation
- Subroutines break up programs into smaller and modular chunks
- They are like a mini-program that we can write separately from the main program, without having to think of the rest of the program while writing it
- This allows us to reduce a complex program into smaller, more manageable chunks, reducing the overall complexity
### Abstraction
- We can use a subroutine at any time, using its unique name and appropriate inputs
### Reusability
- It supports code reusability and reduces repetitive code
- It can be shared with other programs, reducing the need to code from scratch
### Modifying
- When we need to extend our program to handle new cases, subroutines allow us to make changes in one place and have it take effect every time the subroutine is called
### Testing
- The program is easy to test and debug as each subroutine is self-contained
- Once a subroutine is working, there is no need to test it again unless modified

## Defining a function
```python
def my_cool_function(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statements(s)
```
- The `def` keyword marks the start of a function
- Function name are unique 
- Functions need to be called to be run
### Parameters
- Functions can take in optional values, known as parameter before running the code block
```python
def greet(name)
	print(f"Hi, {name}!")
greet("neud")
```
```Terminal
Hi, neud!
```
- When the function is called, arguments need to be passed into the function calls
- The parameters take the arguments passed
- So in this case, `name = "neud"`
- Functions can take in multiple parameters
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		print(a)
	elif a < b:
		print(b)

max(1,10)
```
```Terminal
10
```
- Functions can also have default parameters
```Python
def repeat(text, times= 1)
	while times > 0:
		print(text)
		times -= 1
repeat("hello world")
```
```Terminal
hello world
```

- In this case, if the function is called without specifying times, times will take on a value of 1
### Docstrings
- Docstrings are used to describe what the function does, an can be seen when using an code editor that shoes what a function does
- Written with three single or double quotes (`"`/ `'`)
### return
- Return outputs a value
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	elif a < b:
		return b 

x = max(1,10)
print(x)
```
```Terminal
10
```
- Here, `x` is assigned the return value of `max()`, which is 10 in this case
- If a return value is not specified, the function outputs `None`
- Return statements exit the function
## Global and local variables
- Local variables are variables defined inside the function
- Global variables are variable defined outside of the function
- local vairable cannot be used globally
```python
def repeat(text, times= 1)
	while times > 0:
		print(text)
repeat("hello world")
print(text)
```
```Terminal
hello world
NameError: name 'text' is not defined

```
- Functions can take global variables as local variables, but cannot edit the global vairable
```python
message = "Hello world"
def hello():
	message = "Hi mom!"
	print(message)
hello()
print(message)
```
```Terminal
Hi mom!
Hello world
```
- The global keyword can change that
```python
message = "Hello world"
def hello():
	global message
	message = "Hi mom!"
	print(message)
hello()
print(message)
```
```Terminal
Hi mom!
Hi mom!
```
