## Subroutines
- Subroutines allow us to manage and structure our programs, allowing us to break up programs into smaller chunks of code
- This is called modular design
- There are two types of subroutines: Functions and procedures
- Functions accept input and process them into output
- Functions have to have at least one return value, which is the output
- Procedures are subroutines that do not return values
### Advantages
#### Organisation
- Subroutines help break programs into smaller and modular chunks
- They are almost like a mini-program that we can write separately from the main program, without having to think of the rest of the program while writing it
- This allows us to reduce a complicated program into smaller, more manageable chunks, reducing the overall complexity
#### Abstraction
- We can use a subroutine at any time, using its unique name and appropriate inputs
#### Reusability
- It supports code reusability and reduces repetitive code
- It can also be shared with other programs, reducing the need to code from scratch
#### Modifying
- When we need to extend out program to handle a case it didn't handle before, sub routines allow us to make the change in one place and have that change take effect every time the subroutine is called
#### Testing
- The program is easier to test and debug since each subroutine is self-contained
- Once a subroutine is working properly, there is no need to test it again unless it has been modified
## Defining a function
```python
def my_cool_function(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statements(s)
```
- The `def` keyword marks the start of a function
- Function name are unique 
- Functions need to be called to be run
### Parameters
- Functions can take in optional values, known as parameter before running the code block
```python
def greet(name)
	print(f"Hi, {name}!")
greet("neud")
```
```Terminal
Hi, neud!
```
- When the function is called, arguments need to be passed into the function calls
- The parameters take the arguments passed
- So in this case, `name = "neud"`
- Functions can take in multiple parameters
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		print(a)
	elif a < b:
		print(b)

max(1,10)
```
```Terminal
10
```
- Functions can also have default parameters
```Python
def repeat(text, times= 1)
	while times > 0:
		print(text)
		times -= 1
repeat("hello world")
```
```Terminal
hello world
```

- In this case, if the function is called without specifying times, times will take on a value of 1
### Docstrings
- Docstrings are used to describe what the function does, an can be seen when using an code editor that shoes what a function does
- Written with three single or double quotes (`"`/ `'`)
### return
- Return outputs a value
```python
def max(a,b):
	if a > b:
		return a
	elif a < b:
		return b 

x = max(1,10)
print(x)
```
```Terminal
10
```
- Here, `x` is assigned the return value of `max()`, which is 10 in this case
- If a return value is not specified, the function outputs `None`
- Return statements exit the function
## Global and local variables
- Local variables are variables defined inside the function
- Global variables are variable defined outside of the function
- local vairable cannot be used globally
```python
def repeat(text, times= 1)
	while times > 0:
		print(text)
repeat("hello world")
print(text)
```
```Terminal
hello world
NameError: name 'text' is not defined

```
- Functions can take global variables as local variables, but cannot edit the global vairable
```python
message = "Hello world"
def hello():
	message = "Hi mom!"
	print(message)
hello()
print(message)
```
```Terminal
Hi mom!
Hello world
```
- The global keyword can change that
```python
message = "Hello world"
def hello():
	global message
	message = "Hi mom!"
	print(message)
hello()
print(message)
```
```Terminal
Hi mom!
Hi mom!
```
