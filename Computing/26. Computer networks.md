## Computer network
- A computer network is a system of two or more computers that are connected together by a transmission medium for the exchange of data
### LAN
- A local area network (LAN) is a network of computing devices connected in a small geographical area, typically in the same building
- Due to the small number of connections and the close proximity of the devices, tLANs provide faster data transfers
- Devices on a LAN can share resources easily (e.g. printers, files, and applications)
- A WLAN is a wireless LAN
### WAN
- A wide area network (WAN) is a network of computing devices covering a large-scale geographical area, typically across multiple geographical location
- A WAN consists of multiple smaller networks such as LANs
- A WAN can span over long distances via long-range transmission medium (e.g. telephone lines, fibre optic cables, satellite links)
- A WAN can be private or public
- Private WANs are built by large multi-national companies and government organisations
- The internet is the largest public WAN
### Intranet
- An intranet is a private network built within an organisation, like a company, school, or government agency
- Access to the intranet is restricted to authorised users in the organisation
- This allows them to share information and resources securely within a controlled environment
- Intranets are used to host internal resources like company documents, employee portals, collaboration tools, and communication platforms
- Since access is restricted, intranets offer a more secure environment for sharing sensitive information compared to the internet
### Internet
- The internet is a global public network accessible to anyone with an internet connection
- It is a network of networks liked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies
- It functions through a layered system, with data travelling in packets across networks based on unique IP addresses
- Routers act as traffic directions, guiding this data flow, while the internet service provider provides the connection devices and the network
- This allows for global communication, information sharing and access to a multitude of online resources and services

## Network hardware
### Network interface cards (NICs)
- NICs provide the hardware interface to enable the transfer of data between a device and a network
- A NIC may connect to a network physically or wirelessly
- Most devices are equipped with built in NICs, one for ethernet and one for Wi-Fi
- Each NIC has a unique physical address (MAC address)
- NICs give a device its identification on the network; if it is removed and inserted into a different device, the new device takes the address
### Hubs
- A network hub is the simplest way to connect multiple devices to the same network, used in LANs
- When a hub receives a packet, the packet is transmitted to all devices that are connected to the hub
- When a device responds, the response is sent to every device on the hub
- It is the cheapest option as it does not store any information about the devices that are connected
- But, since it transmits information to all connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient, it can cause bottlenecks that reduce the efficiency of the network
### Switches
- Switches connect multiple devices in a limited area and manage data flow
- It functions like a hub, but can keep track of the connected devices
- It receives data packets from devices, examines the destination address and forwards it to the intended recipient on the network
- This helps to avoid congestion and improves overall network performance
### Routers
- A router allows you to connect to other LANs and assigns IP addresses to devices
- A wireless router allows devices with Wi-FI NICs to connect with each other and the internet
- They are complex devices that connect to multiple networks and direct data packets to their final destination across different networks
- They use routing protocols to determine the most efficient path for data to travel
### Wireless access points
- Wireless access points (WAP) creates wireless LANs, allowing devices to connect to the network cables, and instead communicates using Wi-Fi
### Modems
- Converts digital signals used by computers to analog signals for transmission across telephone lines and cables
- Connects a LAN to other LANs and to the internet to form a WAN
## Network addresses
### MAC address
- ==A media access control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) in a device==
- It acts like a permanent hardware fingerprint for that particular network connection, ensuring that no two devices have the same MAC address
- It plays a crucial role in identifying devices within a LAN, like homes and offices
- When a device transmits data on the network, the MAC address is included in the header of the data packet
- Switches and routers use the MAC address to determine the destination in the network for the data packet
- MAC address is the unique 48-bit hardware number of a device, embedded into the NIC when manufactured
- Made up of 6 hexadecimal digits separated by colons or dashes
### IP address
- ==An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to devices connected within a network that uses the Internet Protocol==
- The internet protocol (IP) is a set of rules for data transmission which are agreed by sender and receiver for communication
- It is used to identify and locate devices on a network, helping data packets reach the correct device on the internet
- When you request a website or online resources, the device sends a data packet with the IP address as the source address
- Routers use the IP address to determine the most efficient path to send the data packet back to the device
- IPv4 addresses are four sets of decimal numbers between 0 and 255, separated by periods, and is 32 bits long
- IPv6 addresses are eight sets of hexadecimal digits separated by colons, and it is 128 bits long
- They can be shortened by emitting leading zeros and sections of consecutive zeros
- IP addresses can be dynamic (address changes periodically, for home user), or static (address is fixed, for servers or devices that need to be easily accessible on the Internet)
## DNS
- The Domain name Service (DNS) is the primary way users refer to resources on the internet
- The DNS allocates readable domain names for internet hosts and provides a system for finding the IP address for an individual domain name
- It converts a host name into an IP address a computer can understand
- The system is set up as a hierarchical distributed database covering all of the internet, which is installed in a large number of DNS servers
- The root servers are at the top the hierarchy, supporting the whole internet
- The root servers are replicated, and multiple copies of their data are kept at all times
- DNS name space is then divided into non-overlapping zones, where each zone has a primary name server with the database stored on it
- Secondary servers get information from the primary server
- Below is the structure of the URL
![[Pasted image 20240525150047.png]]
### How it works
1. When a domain name is requested, the computer checks its local cache to see if the address was looked up recently, if not it will make a request to the recursive DNS server
2. A recursive DNS server has a local cache of recently looked up domain names, if a result is found it is sent back to the computer and the request ends
	- If it cannot be found locally, it sends a request to the root DNS server
3. The root DNS server redirects to the correct top level domain (TLD) server, depending on the request
	- If the address ends with .com, it will refer to the TLD server that deals with .com addresses
4. The TLD Server holds records to find the authoritative server to answer the request (name server)
	- There are multiple name servers for a domain in case one goes down
	- It is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name, and any updates to the domain name is recorded in the DNS records
5. The DNS record is sent back to the recursive DNS server, where a local copy is cached for future requests, which is then relayed to the original client
	- Caching saves on having to make a DNS request every time you communicate with a server
## Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol
- It is broken down organised into layers to handle complexity in data communication
- Each layer provides functionality that depends only on the layer below
- Software developers just need to ensure data is in the correct format
- Each layer is independent of each other
![[Pasted image 20240525181757.png]]
### 1. Application layer
- It provides high-level functionality to end-users
- It provides services to application, such as web browsers (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP)
- Used in web browsers, email clients, FTP clients, operating systems
### 2. Transport layer
- Transmit messages between two programs
- Two protocols operate here: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, establishing a connection, checking for errors and guaranteeing packets arrive in the correct order
- UDP focuses on speed over a guaranteed delivery, suitable for applications like online games
- It is not associated with any hardware, but relies on the functionality of  the internet layer
### 3. Internet layer
- It determines a route between between two devices
- It addresses and routes data packets across networks using the IP protocol, ensuring they are delivered to the correct destination
- Uses routers
### 4. Link layer
- Transmit packets form one device to another using ethernet
- Uses NICs, switches
### 5. Physical layer
- Transmits individual bits using a transmission medium using ethernet
- Uses NICs, modems, wireless adapters, and cables
## TCP/ IP protocol suite
- Protocols ensure successful transmission of data over a network
- As networks can become congestion, data may not be transmitted instantly; a program may receive half a message, and the other half arrives some time later
- To avoid working with incomplete data, we need to define a protocol so that the start and end of messages can be detected unambiguously 
- Each protocol defines a set of rules agreed by the sender and receiver
- The TCP/ Ip suite operates on the application, transport, and internet layer
### TCP
- TCP creates enough packets to hold all of the data, where each packet has a header and the user data
- TCP ensures a safe delivery and any response is directed back to the application protocol
- Thus the header has the port number that identifies the application layer protocol, and the port number for the receiving application
- If the packet is one of a sequence, a sequence number is included to ensure eventual correct reassembly
- But, it is not concerned with the address of the receiving end system
- TCP protocol is connection-oriented
- One packet of a sequence is sent to the network layer at first, and when the connection is established, it sends the other packets and receives response packets
- The packets sent and received are acknowledged in the response packets, allowing missing packets to be identified and resent
### IP
- IP ensures correct routing over the internet
- It takes the packet received from the transport layer and adds a further header, containing the IP address of both the sender and receiver
- It finds the IP address of the receiver using DNS
- The IP packet is sent into the layer, where it is assembled into frames before being transmitted
- IP is a connectionless service
- If it receives a packet which has acknowledgement of a previously sent packet, it will pass it on to TCP without knowing the contents
### Ethernet
- Focused on LANs
- It encapsulates the data from the internet layer into frames with a source and MAC address, and manages multiple transmissions on the medium
## Circuit switching
- ==Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit is established between two devices before data transmission begins==
- The circuit remains dedicated to the communication for the duration of the session, and no other devices can use it will the session in progress
- Used in voice communication and some types of data communication
## Packet switching
- ==Packet switching is a communicated where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network==
- Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, as well as other information needed for routing
- The packets may take different paths to reach their destination, and they maybe be transmitted out of order, or delayed due to traffic congestion
- Upon reaching the destination, they are re-assembled in the correct order to form the original data
- There a two ways a connection can provide a service, connectionless or connection-oriented service
- In a connectionless service, a packet is sent with no knowledge whether or not the receiver is ready to accept it
- In a connection-oriented service, the first packet sent includes a request for acknowledgement, and if it is received, the sender transmit further packets
- If it is not received, the sender tries again with the first packet
### Packet loss
- Some routers may receive packets faster than they are able to route them on
- These packets are buffered in memory, and this introduces delays/ buffering
- If the buffering is severe, the router may run out of memory and packets are simply discarded
- The TOS field in the packet header makes it possible to mark out packets with a priority level and request special treatment, but routers may ignore these requests
- Packets may also be sent to an address which is unavailable
- Routers, which are unaware of this, may route packets to a default device, which may pass the packet on, resulting in a loop, where the packet loops forever between routers
- To prevent this, packets have a time to live counter in their header, which is set when the packet is made and reduced by one every time it goes through a router
- When it reachers zero, the packet is discarded
### Routing tables
- Routing table contain the information necessary to forward a packet along the shortest/ best route to let it reach its destination
- As soon as a packet reachers a router, the packet header is examined and compared with the routing table
- The table supplies the router with information to send the packet to the next available router
---
- Circuit switching pre-allocates the use of the transmission link, regardless of demand, with allocated but unneeded link-time going unused
- Packet switching allocates the link use on demand, and link transmission capacity will be shared on a packet by packet basis only among users that have packets that need to be transmitted over the link

## Client-server architecture
- There is a server that is always on, which services requests form many other hosts, called clients
- The clients do not communicate with each other
- The server has a fixed well-known IP address, and a client can always connect to the server by sending a packet to the IP address
- A single server is not able to keep up with al the requests form clients, and a data center with a large amount of hosts, is used to create a powerful virtual server
- The service providers must pay for recurring interconnection and bandwidth costs for sending data from the data centres
- E.g. The Web, Email, Telnet, File Transfer Protocol

## Peer to peer architecture
- There is minimal or no dedicated servers 
- The application exploits direct communications between pairs of intermittently connected hosts called peers
- The peers are not owned by a service provider, but are computers controlled by users
- They can communicate directly without passing through a directed server
- E.g. File sharing, television and broadcasting, video conference

| Advantages                                                                                             | Disadvantages                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Cheaper to set up as there are no dedicated servers; basic computers act as servers to share resources | More effort is required to access backup resources as they are stored locally in each computer instead of centrally in a server |
| Easy to set up as no specialised software or operating system features are needed                      | Security is low as individuals rights are handled by individual computers, not administered by a central server                 |
| Storage of data is decentralised and can be carried out by individual users at each computer           |                                                                                                                                 |
## Sockets
- A application sends messages into and receives messages form the network though a software interface called a socket
- The deliver data using the same TCP and IP that is used to transfer data over the internet
- They can deliver between data between any two programs, or programs on different computers as long as they can access each other over the network
- Data that is transmitted though a socket may pass though multiple devices before reaching its destination, and these devices can steal of modify the data unless it is encrypted
- A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host
- It is referred to the application programming interface (API) between the application and the network, since the socket is the programming interface with which network applications are built
- The application developer has control of everything on the application layer side of the socket, but little control of the transport layer side of the socket
- They can only choose the transport protocol, and fix a few transport layer parameters
- The IP address and the port number so send information
### TCP socket API
![[Pasted image 20240526002026.png]]
- First, the server creates a passive socket, binds it to the pre chose port number and listens for an internet connection 
- The client initiates a connection request using the servers IP address and port number; if no server is listening on the chosen port, the connection will be refused
- Else, the server accepts and crates a new socket for the client using a dynamically assigned port number
- The passive socket goes back to listening for new connections, while the client and server can now exchange data using the newly created socket
- The newly created socket is symmetrical, data sent on one end is received from the other and vice versa
- Data can be sent from the server to the client and the client to the server
