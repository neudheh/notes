- A computer network is a system of two or more computers that are connected together by a transmission medium for the exchange of data
### LAN
- ==A local area network (LAN) is a network of computing devices connected in a small geographical area, typically in the same building==
- Due to the small number of connections supported and the close proximity of the devices, LANs provide faster data transfers than the other network
- Devices on a  LAN can share resources easily such as printers, files, and applications
- A WLAN is a wireless LAN
### WAN
- ==A wide area network (WAN) is a network of computing devices covering a large-scale geographical area, typically across multiple geographical locations==
- A WAN consists of multiple smaller networks such as LANs
- A WAN is not limited to a single geographical location and can span long distances via long-range transmission media (e.g. telephone lines, fiber optic cables or satellite links)
- A WAN uses more expensive and high-speed technology than a LAN
- A WAN can be private or public
- Private WANs are built and maintained by large multinational companies and government organizations
- The internet is a public WAN, and is the largest WAN in the world
### Intranet
- An intranet is a private network built within an organization, like a company, a school, or government agency
- Access to the intranet is typically restricted to authorized users within the organization
- This allows them to share information and resources securely within a controlled environment
- Intranets are used to host internal resources like company documents, employee portals, collaboration tools and communication platforms
- Since access is restricted, intranets offer a more secure environment for sharing sensitive information compared to the public internet
### Internet
- The internet is a global, public network accessible to anyone with an internet connection
- It is a network of networks linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless and optical networking technologies
- It functions through a layered system, with data travelling in packets across networks based on unique IP addresses
- Routers act as traffic directors, guiding this data flow, while the internet service provider provide the connection devices and the network
- This allows for global communication, information sharing and access to a multitude of online resources and services

## Network hardware
### Network interface cards (NICs)
- NICS provide the hardware interface to enable the transfer of data between a device and a network
- A NIC may connect to a network physically or wirelessly
- Most devices are equipped with built in NICs, one for ethernet and one for Wi-Fi
- Each NIC has a unique 'physical address', otherwise known as the MAC address
- NIC give a device its identification on the network; if it is removed and inserted into a different device, the new device takes the address with it
### Hubs
- A network hub is the simplest way to connect multiple devices to the same network, typically used in LAN
- When a hub receives a packet, the packet is transmitted to all the devices that are connected to the hub
- Similarly, when a device responds, the response is sent to every device connected to the hub
- It is the cheapest option among all the network connection devices as it does not store any information about the devices that are connected to it
- But, because it transmits information to all connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient, it can cause bottlenecks that reduce the efficiency of the network
### Switches
- Switches connect multiple devices within a limited area and manage data flow
- It functions like a hub, but it can keep track of the addresses of connected devices
- It receives data packets form devices, examine the destination address, and forward it to the intended recipient on the network
- This helps to avoid congestion and improves overall network performance
### Routers
- A router allows you to connect to other LANs and they assign IP addresses to devices
- A wireless router will allow computers with Wi-Fi NICs to connect with each other and with the internet
- They are more complex devices that connect to multiple networks and direct data packets to their final destination across different networks
- They use routing protocols to determine the most efficient path for data to travel
### Wireless access points
- Wireless access points (WAP) create wireless local area networks allowing devices to connect to the network without cables
- Communicate with devices using Wi-Fi technology
### Modems
- Facilitates signal conversion and reversion (analog to digital and vice-versa)
- They do so to convert digital signals used by computers to analog signals for transmission over cables or telephone lines
- The are used to connect a LAN to other LANs and to the internet to form a WAN
## Network addresses
### MAC address
- ==A Media Access Control (MAC) address is a unique identifier assigned to a network interface controller (NIC) in a device==
- It acts like a permanent hardware fingerprint for that particular network connection, ensuring that no two devices have the same MAC address
- It plays a crucial role in identifying devices within a local network segment, like homes and offices
- When a device transmits data on the network, the MAC address is included in the header of the data packet
- Switches and routers use the MAC address to determine the specific destination within the network for the data packet
- MAC addresses are unique 48-bit hardware number of a device, which is embedded into NIC during the time of manufacturing
- In the format of 6 groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons or dashes
### IP address
- ==An IP address is a unique numerical label assigned to devices connected to a network that uses the Internet Protocol==
- The internet protocol is a set of rules for data transmission which are agreed by sender and receiver for communication
- It is used to identify and locate devices on a network, helping data packets reach the correct device on the internet
- When you request a website or online resources, your device sends a data packet with your IP address as the source address
- Routers use this IP address to determine the most efficient path to send the data packets back to the device
- IPv4 addresses are written as four sets of number separated by periods
- IPv4 uses four denary numbers between 0 and 255, and are 32 bits long
- IPv6 addresses uses eight groups of hexadecimal digits separated by colons
- IPv6 is 128 bits long, but can be shorten by omitting leading zeros as well as a section of consecutive zeros
- IP addresses can be dynamic or static
- ISP typically assign dynamic addresses to home users, where the address changes periodically
- Static IP addresses are fixed and do not change, and are used for servers or devices that need to be easily accessible on the internet
## DNS
- The Domain Name Service (DNS) is the primary way users refer to resources on the internet
- The DNS service allocate readable domain names for internet hosts and provides a system for finding the IP address for an individual domain name
- Domain names eliminate the need for a user to memorize IP addresses
- The DNS process involves converting a host name into an IP address the computer can understand
- DNS also store other information such as the list of mail servers
- DNS servers contain a database of URLs with the matching IP address
- The system is set up as a hierarchical distributed database, which is installed in a large number of DNS servers overing the whole of the internet
- The root servers are at the top of the hierarchy, supporting the whole internet
- The root servers are replicated, and multiple copies of their data are kept at all times
- DNS name space is then divided into non-overlapping zones, where each zone has a primary name server with the database stored on it
- Secondary servers get information from the primary server
- Below is the structure of the URL
![[Pasted image 20240525150047.png]]
### How it works
1. When you first request a domain name, your computer first checks its local cache to see if you have looked up the address recently
	- If not, it will make a request to your recursive DNS server
2. A recursive DNS server has a local cache of recently looked up domain names, if a result is found, it is sent back to your computer and the requests ends
	- If it cannot be found locally, it sends a request to the root DNS server
3. The root DNS server redirects you to to correct top level domain (TLD) server, depending on your request
	- If you are going to an address that ends with .com, it will refer to the correct TLD server that deals with .com addresses
4. The TLD server holds records for where to find the authoritative server to answer the DNS request, also known as the nameserver
	- There are multiple nameservers for a domain in case one goes down
	- It is responsible for storing the DNS records for a particular domain name, and any update to the domain name would be recorded in the DNS records
5. The DNS record is then sent back to the recursive DNS server, where a local copy will be cached for future request, and then relayed back to the original client
	- Caching saves on having to make a DNS request every time you communicate with a server
## Transmission Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol Model
![[Pasted image 20240525181757.png]]
- We have layers to handle complexity in data communication, breaking the system down and organizing it into layers
- Each layer provides functionality that depends solely on the layer below it
- Software developers just need to ensure that data is in the correct format 
- Each layer is independent of the others
### 1. Application layer
- It provides high-level functionality to end-users
- It provides services to applications we use everyday, such as web browsing (HTTP), email (SMTP), file transfer (FTP), and video conferencing
- Web browsers, email clients, FTP clients, operating systems
### 2. Transport layer
- Provides functionality to transmit messages between any two programs
- Two protocols operate here; Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP)
- TCP ensures reliable and ordered delivery of data, acting like a reliable courier service, establishing a connection, checking for errors and guaranteeing packets arrive in the correct order
- UDP focuses on speed over a guaranteed delivery, suitable for applications where speed is more important like online games
- Not associated with hardware, but relies on the functionality of the network access layer
### 3. Internet layer
- Provides a functionality to determine a route between any two devices
- It is the heart of routing, addressing adn routing data packets across network using the IP protocol
- Ensures packets are delivered to the correct destination
- Routers
### 4. Link layer
- Provides functionality to transmit packets from one device to an adjacent device using ethernet
- NICs, switches
### 5. Physical layer
- Provides functionality to transmit individual bits through a transmission medium  using ethernet
- NICs, modems, wireless adapters, cables
## TCP/ IP protocol suite
- Protocols are essential for successful transmission of data over a network
- As networks can become congested, we cannot assume that data sent over internet sockets will be transmitted instantaneously
- A program may only receive the first half of a message, and the second half may arrive some time later
- To avoid working with incomplete data, we will need to define a protocol so that the start and end of messages can be detected unambiguously
- Each protocol defines a ser of rules that must be agreed between sender and receiver
- The TCP/ IP suite on operates on the application, transport and network layers
### TCP
- TCP protocol creates enough packets to hold all of the data
- Each packet consists of a header plus the user data
- As well as needing to ensure safe delivery, TCP has to ensure that any response is directed back to the application protocol
- Thus, one item in the header is the port number which identifies the application layer -protocol
- For example, web browsers use the port number 80, and the packet must have the port number
- The packet must also have the port number for the receiving application
- If the packet is one of a sequence, a sequence number is included to ensure eventual correct reassembly of user data
- But, it is not concerned with the address of the receiving end system
- TCP protocol is connection-oriented
- One packet of a sequence is sent to the network layer at first, and when the connection is established, TCP sends the other packers and receives response packets
- The packets sent and received are acknowledge in the response packets, allowing missing packets to be identified and resent
### IP
- IP is the ensure correct routing over the internet
- It takes the packet received from the transport layer and adds a further header, containing the IP addresses of both the sender and the receiver
- It finds the IP address of the receiver using DNS
- The IP packet is sent to the link layer, and there it is assembled into frames before being transmitted
- At the link layer, IP has no further duty
- IP is a connectionless service
- If it receives a packet which contained acknowledgement of a previously sent packet, it will pass it on to TCP without knowing the contents
### Ethernet
- Focused on LANS
- It encapsulates the data from the previous layer into frames with a source and a MAC address, and managed multiple transmissions on the media
## Transmission mode
### Circuit switching
- ==Circuit switching is a communication method where a dedicated communication path, or circuit is established between two devices before data transmission begins==
- The circuit remains dedicated to the communication for the duration of the session, and no other devices can use it while the session is in progress
- Used in voice communication and some types of data communication
### Packet switching
- ==Packet switching is a communication method where data is divided into smaller units called packets and transmitted over the network==
- Each packet contains the source and destination addresses, as well as other information needed for routing
- The packets may take different paths to reach their destination, and they may be transmitted out of order or delayed due to network congestion
- Upon reaching the destination, they are reassembled in the correct order to form the original data
- There are two ways a connection can provide a service, connectionless or connection-oriented service
- In a connectionless service, a packet is sent with no knowledge whether or not the receiver is ready to accept it
- In a connection-oriented service, the first packet sent includes a request for acknowledgement, and if it is received, the sender transmit further packets
- If it is not received, the sender tries again with the first packet
#### Packet loss
- Some routers may receive packets faster than they are able to route them on
- These packets are buffered in memory, and this introduces delays/ buffering
- If the buffering is severe, the router may run out of memory and packets are simply discarded
- The TOS field in the packet header makes it possible to mark out packets with a priority level and request special treatment (e.g. placed at the front of the queue of packets to be routed)
- But, routers may choose to ignore these requests
- Packets may also be sent to an address that is unavailable
- Routers, which are unaware of this, may route packets to a default device, which may pass the packet on resulting in a loop, where the packet loops forever between routers
- To prevent this, packets have a time to live counter in their header, which is set when the packet is made, and reduced by one every time it goes through a router
- When it reaches 0, the packet is discarded
#### Routing tables
- Routing tables contains the information necessary to forward a packet along the shortest/ best route to let it reach its destination
- As soon as a packet reaches a router, the packet header is examined and compared with the routing table
- The table supplies the router with information to send the packet to the next available router
---
- Circuit switching pre-allocates the use of transmission link regardless of demanded, with allocated but unneeded link-time going unused
- Packet switching allocates the link use on demand, and link transmission capacity will be shared on a packet by packet basis only among users who have packets that need to be transmitted over the link

| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Data transfer** | Breaks data into packets, sent independently       | Dedicated path established between sender and reciever             |
| **Routing**       | Packets can take different routes based on traffic | Dedicated path remains fixed for entire communication              |
| **Bandwith**      | Dynamically allocated based on traffic             | Guanteed bandwidth for communication                               |
| **Efficency**     | More efficient for bursty data traffic             | Less efficient for bursty data traffic                             |

| **Applications**  | Ideal for data transfer (email, web browsing)      | Ideal for real time applications (voice calls, video conferencing) |
## Client-server architecture
- There is a server that is always on, which services requests from many other hosts, called clients
- When a server requests for an object from a client, it responds by sending the requested object to the client host
- The clients do not communicate with each other
- The server has a fixed, well-known IP address, and a client can always connect to the server by sending a packet to the IP address
- A single server is not able to keep up with all the requests from clients
- In this case, a data center, with a large amount of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server
- The service providers must pay for recurring interconnection and bandwidth costs for sending data from their data centers
- Examples are the Web, Email, Telnet and File transfer protocol

| Easy to schedule backups of all shared files at regular intervals                                               | Administrative costs needed for the maintenance of servers and clients |
| Security may be enhanced with the use of specialized software or operating system features designed for servers |                                                                        |
## Peer to peer architecture
- There is minimal or no reliance on dedicated servers in data centers
- Instead, the application exploits direct communications between pairs of intermittently connected hosts, called peers
- The peers are not owned by a service provided, but are laptops and desktops controlled by users 
- They can communicate without passing through a dedicated server
- Examples are file sharing, television and broadcasting, and video conference

| Advantage                                                                                                             | Disadvantages                                                                                                                  |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Cheaper to set up as there is no cost related to dedicated servers; basic computers act as servers to share resources | More effort is required to access backup resources as they are store locally in each computer instead of centrally in a server |
| Easy to set up as no specialized software or operating system features are needed                                     | Security is low as individual rights are handled by individual computers; not administered by a central server                 |
| Storage of data is decentralized and can be carried out by individual users at each computer                          |                                                                                                                                |
## Sockets
- A application sends messages into and receives messages form the network though a software interface called a socket
- The deliver data using the same TCP and IP that is used to transfer data over the internet
- They can deliver between data between any two programs, or programs on different computers as long as they can access each other over the network
- Data that is transmitted though a socket may pass though multiple devices before reaching its destination, and these devices can steal of modify the data unless it is encrypted
- A socket is the interface between the application layer and the transport layer within a host
- It is referred to the application programming interface (API) between the application and the network, since the socket is the programming interface with which network applications are built
- The application developer has control of everything on the application layer side of the socket, but little control of the transport layer side of the socket
- They can only choose the transport protocol, and fix a few transport layer parameters
- The IP address and the port number so send information
### TCP socket API
![[Pasted image 20240526002026.png]]
- First, the server creates a passive socket, binds it to the pre chose port number and listens for an internet connection 
- The client initiates a connection request using the servers IP address and port number; if no server is listening on the chosen port, the connection will be refused
- Else, the server accepts and crates a new socket for the client using a dynamically assigned port number
- The passive socket goes back to listening for new connections, while the client and server can now exchange data using the newly created socket
- The newly created socket is symmetrical, data sent on one end is received from the other and vice versa
- Data can be sent from the server to the client and the client to the server
