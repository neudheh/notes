## Data lifecycle
- Data is information coded and structured for subsequent processing
- It is any sequence of one or more symbols
- Data requires interpretation to become information
- In computers, data is stored digitally, using the binary number system of ones and zeros, allowing us to use the computer to process data
- The data life cycle refers to the entire period of time that data exists in the system
- It encompasses all the stages that the data goes through, from its creation to its eventual disposal, compassing the entire lifespan of data in an organization or system

## Data privacy
- ==Data privacy is the requirement for data to be accessed by or disclosed to authorized users only==
- It is about keeping data private rather than allowing it to be available in the public domain
- It is important that unauthorized people do not have access to data they are not supposed to have
- But, in today's digitalized society, it is easier than ever to gather a person's data and use it to gain valuable insights, track his/ her movements, or commit fraud
- As more services become available online, the risk of fraudulent use of data increases
- Organizations not only have to restrict access data that is private to them, but also responsible under privacy protection legislation to protect data they collect from individuals
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The websites you visit often reveal which products you are more likely to buy as a shopper, which is valuable information to a company or advertiser
>- With a photo of your IC, a person can impersonate you and register for a new phone line on a telephone company's website
>- Machines can gather information on a person easily, such as preforming facial recognition on surveillance videos to track your whereabouts\
## Data integrity
- ==Data integrity refers to the accuracy and validity of data==
- It covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit
- It can be compromised through 
	- **Errors on input** - Data that is keyed in may be wrongly transcribed. A batch of transaction data can go astray, or keyed in twice by mistake
	- **Errors in operating procedures** - An update program can be run twice in error, and quantities on a master file would then be updated twice
	- **Program errors** - These could lead to corruption of files, a new system may have errors in it that may not surface for some time, or errors may be introduced during program maintenance
	- **Viruses** - Files can be corrupted or deleted if the disk becomes infected with a virus
	- **Transmission errors** - Interference or noise in a communications link may cause bits to be wrongly received
- Each time data is replicated or transferred, it should remain intact and unaltered between updates
- Error-checking methods and validation procedures are typically relied on to ensure the integrity of data that is transferred or reproduced without the intention of alteration
## Threats to data
- **Lapse in user's behavior** - Users may not be careful when dealing with data, such as making errors in data entry, or revealing their OTP/ passwords to others
- **Mismanagement by multiple users** - Multiple users working on the same file may accidentally overwrite each other's data, causing data to be inaccurate or invalid
- **Natural disasters** - They may destroy the computer system and/ or storage device physically
- **Unauthorized intrusion into the system** - If the system is vulnerable to hackers, data may be corrupted or loss. Other cyberattacks such as viruses, worms, and trojans are equally damaging to the system and its data
- **Malicious software** - Malicious software entering the computing system will caused harm to a system and the data stored in it
## Methods to protect data
### Data backup
- Modern storage equipment usually provides built in disk clustering and redundancy in the event data in the primary storage is lost or corrupted
- Users can also corrupt data or do a data backup
- ==Data backup involves creating copies of data and storing them separately==
- It is intended to be used as a safety precaution or prevention against unexpected loss of data due to unintended data corruption or errors such as disk drive failing, files being accidentally deleted, or a data center going offline during a catastrophic event
- It is a short-solution and may be performed on a regular basis to ensure that data is up to data and readily available in case of a data loss event
### Data archive
- ==Archiving data involves storing data that is not actively used but kept for historical references or auditing purposes==
- It ensures that important records remain available after years they were created
- In most cases, the purpose of data archiving is to meet legal and compliance requirements
- Backups help with data recovery in the event of data loss or corruption or hardware failure, while archives help with long-term retention and space management

|                       | Backup                                                                                | Archive                                                                          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data storage methods**  | The original data remains in place, while a backup copy is stored in another location | Archived data is moved from its original location to an archive storage location |
| **Data state**            | Backed-up data is constantly changing                                                 | Once you create and archive, you do not modify it                                |
| **Data retention policy** | You periodically delete or overwrite data backups that are too old to be useful       | Data archives are designed for long-term storage                                 |
| **Storage type**          | Hot cloud storage or easily accessible local storage locations                        | Cold cloud storage or tape archives                                              |
| **Data scope**            | All of your data, with the exception of unimportant information like tempoary files   | Specific files that you retain for compliance purposes                           |
### Restricting access
- We can also ensure only authorized users can access our data, using
	- **Passwords** - Ensure users follow general guidelines to ensure strong passwords
	- **2FA** - In the form of security tokens or OTP
	- **Biometrics** - In the form of facial recognition and fingerprint scanning
- Such authentication and authorization controls help us verify credentials and ensure user privileges are applied correctly
- These measures are typically used as part of an identity and access management solution and in combination with role-based access controls
### Version control
- Version control is system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later
- Git is a commonly used version tool, allowing users to rollback to previous working versions of processes to fix mistakes while minimizing disruption to other team members
- Git has 3 main states your files can reside in; modified, staged, and committed
- Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to the database yet
- Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot
- Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database
### File naming conventions
- File naming conventions is a framework for naming files in a way that describes what they contain and how they relate to other file
- This helps to minimize the chances of files being misplaced or lost unintentionally due to poor organization of files
- Such a convention allows users to locate files easily
- Developing a FNC is done by identifying key elements of the project and the important differences and commonalities between files
- Best practices
	- Files should be named consistently
	- Files should be short but descriptive
	- Avoid special characters and spaces
	- Use capitals and underscores instead of periods, spaces, or slashes
	- Use the date format YYYYMMDD
	- Include a version number
	- Write down the naming convention in the data management plan
- Consider putting in the
	- Date of creation
	- Short description
	- Work
	- Location
	- Project name or number
	- Sample
	- Analysis
	- Version number
### Validation and verification
- Data validation and verification are measures to check data when it is entered into the system, or transmitted from one system to another
### Disaster recovery
- Disaster recovery is a set of practices and technologies that determine how an organization delas with a disaster, such as a cyber attack, natural disaster, or large-scale equipment failure
- It involves setting up a remote disaster recovery site with copies of protected systems and switching operations to those systems in case of disaster
### Encryption
- Encryption alters data content according to an algorithm that can only be reversed with the right encryption key
- Encryption protects data from unauthorized access even if data is stolen by making it unreadable
### Erasure
- Data erasure is more secure than data wiping becuase it uses software to completely overwrite data on any storage device
- It verifies that data is unrecoverable, and limits liability by deleting data that is no longer needed
- This can be done after data is processed and analyzed or periodically when data is no longer relevant
- Erasing unnecessary data is a requirement of many compliance regulations
## Governance of personal data
### Personal data
- ==Personal data is data about an individual who can be identified from the data, or from data and other information to which the organization has or is likely to have access==
- Can include
	- Names
	- Contact numbers
	- NIRC or passport number
	- Photograph or video image of an individual
	- Telephone number
	- Email address
	- Thumbprint
	- Address
	- any other data that forms part of an individual's record
### PDPA
- ==The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is a data protection law that protects against the misuse of personal data by governing the collection, use disclosure, and care of personal data in Singapore==
- It recognizes the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction
- It also recognizes the needs of organizations to collect use and disclose personal data for legitimate purposes
- PDPA maintains individuals trust in organizations to manage their data\
- By regulating the flow of personal data among organizations, the PDPA strengthens Singapore's position as a trusted hub for business
- Organizations are required to comply with the various data protection obligations if they undertake activities relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data
#### 1. Accountability Obligation
- Undertake measures to ensure organizations meet their obligations under the PDPA 
- E.g. making information about data protection policies, practices and complaints process available upon request
- Designate a data protection officer (DPO) and making the business contact information available to the public
#### 2. Notification Obligation
- Notify individuals of the purposes for which the organization is intending to collect, use, or disclose their personal data
#### 3. Consent Obligation
- Only collect, use, and disclose personal data which an individual has given consent to

- Once consent is withdrawn, make sure you cease to collect, use, or disclose the individuals personal data
#### 4. Purpose Limitation Obligation
- Only collect, use, or disclose personal data for the purposes a reasonable person would consider appropriate under the given circumstance, and for which the individual has given consent
- An organization may not, as a condition of providing a product or service, require the individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service
#### 5. Accuracy Obligation
- Make reasonable effort to ensure that personal data collected is accurate and complete, especially if it used to make a decision that affects the individual or to be disclosed to another organization
#### 6. Protection Obligation
- Reasonable security arrangement have to be made to protect personal data in your organizations possession to prevent unauthorized access, collection, use, disclosure, or similar risks
#### 7. Retention Limitation Obligation
- Cease retention of personal data or dispose of it in a proper manner when it is no longer needed for any business or legal purpose
#### 8. Transfer Limitation Obligation
- Transfer personal data to another country only according to the requirements prescribed under the regulation, to ensure that the standard of protection is comparable to the protection under the PDPA, unless exempted by the PDPC
#### 9. Access and Correction Obligation
- Upon request, organizations have to provide individuals with access to their personal data as well as information about how it was used or disclosed within a year before the request
- Organizations are required to correct any error or omission in an individual's personal data as soon as possible and send the corrected data to which the personal data was disclosed (or select organizations the individual has consented to), within a year before the correction is made
#### 10. Data Breach Notification Obligation
- In the event of a data breach, organizations must take steps to asses if it is notifable
- If the breach results in significant harm to individuals, and/ or are significant scale, organizations are to notify the PDPC and the affected individuals as soon as possible
#### 11. Data Portability Obligation
- At the request of the individual, organizations are required to transmit the individual’s data that is in the organization’s possession or under its control, to another organization in a commonly used machine-readable format
