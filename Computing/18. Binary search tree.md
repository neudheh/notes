## Binary tree
- ==Binary tree is a tree data structure where two nodes have at most two children, the left child and the right child==
## Binary search tree
- ==A binary search tree is a type of binary tree where for each node, all of the values in the left subtree are less or equal to the node's value, and the values of all nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node's value==
- This makes it useful for searching and retrieving data
![[bst structure.png]]
- It is represented by nodes connected by edges
- A tree's topmost node is called a root node
- A node that has a sub-node is called a parent node
- A node can have 0, 1 or 2 children
- Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes
## OOP Implementation
### Node object
- The node object has the data, and two pointers to the left and right child
```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.left = None
		self.right = None
```
### Insertion
1. If the tree is empty, make the data to be inserted the root node
2. Start from the root node
3. If the data is greater than the current node, go to the right subtree and repeat
4. If the data is lesser than the current node, go to the left subtree and repeat
### Searching
1. Start from the root node
2. If the data being searched is greater than the current node, go to the right subtree and repeat
3. If the data being searched is lesser than the current node, go to the left subtree and repeat
4. If the data being searched is equal to the current node, return

Python
```python
 class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.left = None
		self.right = None
		
class BST:
	def __init__(self):
		self.root = None

	def insert(self, data):
		if self.root == None:
			self.root = Node(data)
			return
		else:
			curr = self.root # create curr pointer
			prev = curr # previous pointer
			while curr != None:
				prev = curr
				if data < curr.data: # if lesser than current, go left
					curr = curr.left
				else:
					curr = curr.right # else go right
		if data < prev.data: # inserts the data
			prev.left = Node(data)
		else:
			prev.right = Node(data)
			
	def search(self, data):
		curr = self.root
		while curr != None:
			if data == curr.data:
				return curr
			elif data < curr.data:
				curr = curr.left
			elif data > curr.data:
				curr = curr.right
		# the search has failed otherwise
```
### Deleting (no coding needed)
- We will need to consider 3 cases, one where it is a leaf node, one where it has one child, and one where it has two children
#### No child
- Simply get rid of the pointer pointing to the leaf node
#### One child
- Replace the node that is being deleted with its child node
- This includes the node and its decedents
![[bst deletion one child.png]]
#### Two children
- Search for the next node in order (for example, the next biggest node after 3 is 4)
- Found by finding the smallest value in the right subtree of the node being deleted
- Replace the node that being deleted with the next biggest node (replace the data of the node being deleted, and delete the next biggest node)

### Updating (no coding needed)
- Simply delete the previous node, and insert the new data
## Array implementation
- The pointers store the index of the child nodes, and none or -1 can indicate no further nodes
![[bst array implementation.png]]
## Time complexity
- When there is a balanced binary search tree, where the height difference of the nodes on the left and right subtree is no more than 1, the height of the tree becomes $\log n$, where n is the number of nodes
- To find an element in the 2nd level, it will need 2 comparisons, 3rd level would need 3, etc
- Hence, time complexity is $\Omega(\log n)$
- If the tree is not balanced, we may have to traverse from the root node to the deepest leaf node, causing the height of the tree to become $n$
- This causes a time complexity to become $O(n)$
- This difference between time complexity is large, and we may need to rebalance the tree to maintain search performance
## Traversal
- To traverse a tree, we will need to recurse on its left and right subtrees
### Pre-order
- Preorder is the data at the node, followed by left subtree, right subtree,
```python
def preorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	print(node.data)
	self.preorder_traversal(node.left)
	self.preorder_traversal(node.right)
```
### In-order
- In-order is left subtree, then the node, then the right subtree
```python
def inorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	self.inorder_traversal(node.left)
	print(node.data)
	self.inorder_traversal(node.right)
```
### Post-order
- Post-order is left subtree, then the right subtree, then the node
```python
def inorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	self.inorder_traversal(node.left)
	self.inorder_traversal(node.right)
	print(node.data)
```
