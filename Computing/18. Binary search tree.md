## Binary tree
- ==Binary tree is a tree data structure where two nodes have at most two children, the let child and the right child==
## Binary search tree
- ==Binary search tree is a type of binary tree where for each node, all of the nodes in the left subtree are less than or equal to the node's value, and the values of all the nodes in the right subtree are greater than the node's value==
- This makes it useful for searching and retrieving data
![[bst structure.png]]
- It is represented by nodes connected by edges
- A tree's topmost node is called a root node
- A node that has a sub-node is called a parent node
- A node can have 0, 1, or 2 children
- Nodes with no children are called leaf nodes
## OOP implementation
### Node object
- The node object has the data, and two pointers to the left and right child
```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.left = None
		self.right = None
```
### Insertion
1. If the tree is empty, insert the data at the root node
2. Start from the root node
3. If the data is greater than the current node, go to the right subtree and repeat
4. If the data is lesser than the current node, go to the left subtree and repeat
### Searching
1. Start from the root node
2. If the data being searched is greater than the current node, go to the right subtree and repeat
3. If the data being searched is lesser than the current node, go to the left subtree and repeat
4. If the data being searched is equal to the current node, return
```pseudo
PROCEDURE insert (self, data)
	IF self.root IS NONE // empty tree
		THEN
			self.root <- Node(data)
		ELSE
			curr <- self.root
			inserted <- FALSE
		WHILE not inserted DO
			IF data < curr.data // branch left
				THEN
					IF curr.left IS NONE
						THEN
							curr.left <- Node(data)
							inserted <- TRUE
						ELSE
							curr <- curr.left
					ENDIF
				ELSE // branch right
					IF curr.right IS NONE
						THEN
							curr.right <- Node(data)
							inserted <- TRUE
						ELSE
							curr <- curr.right
					ENDIF
			ENDIF
		ENDWHILE
	ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE

FUNCTION search (self, data)
	curr <- root
	WHILE curr IS NOT NONE
		IF data == curr.data
			THEN
				RETURN curr
			ELSE
				IF data < curr.data
					THEN
						curr <- curr.left
					ELSE
						curr <- curr.right
				ENDIF
		ENDIF
	ENDWHILE
	// the search has failed
	RETURN NONE
ENDFUNCTION
```

```python
 class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
		self.data = data
		self.left = None
		self.right = None
		
class BST:
	def __init__(self):
		self.root = None

	def insert(self, data):
		if self.root == None:
			self.root = Node(data)
			return
		inserted = False
		curr = self.root
		while not inserted:
			if data <= curr.data:
				if curr.left == None
					curr.left = Node(data)
					inserted = True
				else:
					curr = curr.left
			else:
				if curr.right == None:
					curr.right = Node(data)
					inserted = True
				else:
					curr = curr.right	
			
	def search(self, data):
		curr = self.root
		while curr != None:
			if data == curr.data:
				return curr
			elif data < curr.data:
				curr = curr.left
			elif data > curr.data:
				curr = curr.right
		# the search has failed otherwise
```
### Deleting (no coding required)
- We will need to consider 3 cases, one where it is a leaf node, one where it has one child, and one where it has two children
#### Leaf node
- Simply get rid of the pointer pointing to the leaf node
#### One Child
- Replace the node that is being deleted with its child node
- That includes the node and its descendants
![[bst deletion one child.png]]
#### Two children
- Search for the next node in order (for example, the next biggest node after 3 is 4)
- Found by finding the smallest value in the right subtree of the node being delted
- Replace the node that being deleted with the net biggest node (replace the data of the node being deleted, and delete the next biggest node)
![[bst deletion two children.png]]
### Updating (no coding needed)
- Simply delete the previous node, and insert the new data
## Array implementation
- The pointers store the index of the child nodes, and none or -1 can indicate no further nodes
![[bst array implementation.png]]
## Time complexity
- When there is a balanced binary search tree, where the height difference of the nodes on the left and right subtree is no more than 1, the height of the tree becomes $log n$, where $n$ is the number of nodes
- To find an element in the second level, it will need 2 comparisons, 3rd level would need 3, etc.
- Hence, time complexity is $\Omega(\log n)$
- If the tree is not balanced, we may have to travel from the root node to the deepest leaf node, causing the heigh of the tree to be $n$
- This causes the time complexity to become $O(n)$
- The difference in time complexity is large, and we may need to rebalance the tree to maintain search performance
## Traversal
- To traverse a tree, we will need to recurse on its left and right subtrees
### Pre-order
- Preorder is the data at the node, followed by left subtree, right subtree
```pseudo
FUNCTION preorder(self, node)
	IF node IS NOT NONE
		THEN
			OUTPUT node.value
			self.preorder(node.left)
			self.preorder(node.right)
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

```python
def preorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	print(node.data)
	self.preorder_traversal(node.left)
	self.preorder_traversal(node.right)
```
### In-order
- In-order is left subtree, then the node, then the right subtree
```pseudo
FUNCTION inorder(self, node)
	IF node IS NOT NONE
		THEN
			self.inorder(node.left)
			OUTPUT node.value
			self.inorder(node.right)
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

```python
def inorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	self.inorder_traversal(node.left)
	print(node.data)
	self.inorder_traversal(node.right)
```
### Post-order
- Post-order is left subtree, then the right subtree, then the node
```pseudo
FUNCTION postorder(self, node)
	IF node IS NOT NONE
		THEN
			self.postorder(node.left)
			self.postorder(node.right)
			OUTPUT node.value
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```

```python
def inorder_traversal(self, node):
	if node == None:
		return
	self.inorder_traversal(node.left)
	self.inorder_traversal(node.right)
	print(node.data)
```
