## Government budget
$$Government\ budget = Tax\ revenue - Government\ spending$$
- Government spending consists of government expenditure and transfer payments
- Government expenditure refers to direct expenditure undertaken by the government on goods and services
- Government expenditure ($G$) contributes to AD and is included in the GDP
- Transfer payments are funds paid to individuals by the government for which it receives no goods and services in return
- These include unemployment benefits, income support payments, and bursaries for students
- Transfer payments will not directly increase AD as they do not contribute towards demand for final goods and services
- Transfer payments indirectly increases AD when households spend the transfer payments received on final goods and services, increasing AD through $C$
- Government tax revenue comes from direct taxes and indirect taxes
- Direct taxes refer to taxes imposed on all forms of income and is paid directly to the government, such as personal income tax and corporate tax
- Indirect taxes refer to a compulsory levy imposed on the sale of goods and services, such as GST
- When a government runs a budget deficit, it can be financed by using past accumulated reserves
- In the future, the government will has less reserves to spend, or tax revenue will have to be diverted to pay for the resulting debt and the interest incurred
- There will be less financial resources in the future for the government so spend on social and developmental needs
- There is an intergenerational transfer of welfare from future generations to current ones
- Excessive fiscal debt may result in the government's creditors becoming fearful that the government will default on its debt, triggering capital flight
- This can create severe macroeconomic instability, thus the government may need to undertake painful austerity measures that have a contractionary effect on the economy
## Expansionary fiscal policy
- An expansionary fiscal policy would involved reducing direct tax and/ or increasing government spending
- This is to address the problems of negative actual growth (recession)and demand-deficient unemployment due to a fall in demand for domestic goods and services
- It can also be used to combat demand-side deflation
- Governments can increase government expenditure ($G$) component of AD by building infrastructure such as roads
- Governments can increase the consumption expenditure ($C$) component of AD by giving more transfer payments such as cash vouchers to households
- This will increase disposable income and their purchasing power, and they will demand more consumer goods and services
- Governments can increase the consumption expenditure ($C$) and investment expenditure ($I$) components of AD by cutting direct taxes
- Lower income tax means that households will have higher disposable income, increasing their purchasing power
- They will spend more on consumers goods and services to satisfy their wants
- Lower corporate tax will increase the post-tax expected rate of returns on investment
- With higher returns on investments, firms will be incentivized to increase investment expenditure, and will buy more capital goods

- This would increase AD and lead to a rightward shift in AD from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- Firms will see an unplanned fall in inventories, and will increase production by hiring more factors of production
- Household's income will increase, and they will spend a portion of it domestic goods and services, leading to a rise in induced consumption
- This causes AD to shift from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- This leads to another unplanned fall in inventories, and further increases in production and more FOPs being hired, resulting in another cycle of spending
- There would be a multiplied increased in real GDP to $Y_2$ due to the multiplier effect
- There is actual economic growth as illustrated by a rise in real GDP form $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- There is also a fall in demand deficient unemployment as derived demand for labor increases as firms increase output
