- 5 billion people on earth use the internet, according to DataReportal
- In Singapore, 96.9% of people use the internet, according to a 2023 study
- 85% of Singaporeans uses more than 7 social media internet
## Tech has reduced face to face communication
- As we can function in society through online communication. it has led to the diminishing of quality of face-to-face interactions
### Examples
- We engage in online communication for a range of needs like daily conversations, and even dating like on tinder
- Forbes: *This generation of your seems to focus more on the quantity of conversation through online means rather than the quantity*
- People who find themselves living on social media more than in the real world could also experience a greater sense of disconnectedness when around others, preferring instead to be on their phones and continuing to exist within the social media world
## Online communications is less authentic
- Online communication gives users more control
- It can be synchronous, where people are speaking at the same time, like in phone calls, or asynchronous, where there is a time delay between messages like texting or email
- This makes it possible for users to be less authentic in their online communication, like editing the photos shared, or holding back information
- When manipulation is involved, authenticity can be undermined, like if one were to edit the pictures one puts up on Instagram or dating apps
## People are less authentic on social media
- The impulse to obscure or edit how users’ lives look on social media is natural or even necessary in the face of scrutiny from so many strangers
- This desire not to show vulnerability is natural and given the nature of social media, even necessary to protect ourselves from the horde of anonymous people who are waiting to pounce on any mistakes we make or flaws we may have
### Examples
- Teresa, a former influencer with 10k followers in Instagram, was trying to be authentic, but holding back parts of her personality like sadness
- She could not be fully authentic when posting about items she was promoted to sell
- Once someone she didn’t know showed up at my house saying he knew where her dog was after she had posted about her being missing
- She received death threats from middle-aged men saying they knew where she lived
## Social media apps are selling our attention to advertisers
- They employ subliminal cues to get us to use their app more
- The 'pull to refresh' is akin to a slot machine, when we pull, the possibility of something new appearing on our screens entices us
- We cannot know when we will be rewarded, and more often than not we don’t find anything interesting or gratifying, much like gambling. But that’s precisely what keeps us coming back
- These methods get us to spend more time on the app, allowing them to show more advertisements to us
- Social media apps track our interaction with posts, how long we spend looking at posts, and this use this info to build a profile on us like are we an introvert and our mood
- For example, maybe when we feel like closing the app, the app will send a post that aligns with our interests that is intended to get us to spend longer on it
- This profile allows for more targeted advertising, and causes us to spend more time on our phones
- When we spend an increasing amount of time on our phones, we feel a sense of disconnect with others, reducing our communication skills
## Social media ruins our mental health
- Humans are social creatures, and seek the approval of others
- Social media exposes us to the scrutiny of billions of people all over the world, and when such a large scale amount of people are allowed to pick at us, it causes us to feel very anxious, fragile and depressed with lesser self-confidence
- Even if we also are generally liked by people the like and thumbs ups on our posts, which give us small rushes of dopamine because we feel valued, we will seek it more and more, causing us to feel empty inside, always seeking the approval of others, forcing us into a vicious cycle
- There was a huge increase in depression, anxiety, self harm and suicides in American teenage girls, around 2010, the same year of the advent of social media
## Social media psychologically manipulates us
- Social media personally curates a feed for us
- For example, when you search climate change is on google, google autocompletes your search for you based on your location, the profile it has on you, and any other data it has
- It creates our own version of reality and facts, which we believe
- Recommendation systems uses our interests, and gives us own rabbit hole to fall into, and causes us to believe that thing more and more, but at the same time increases our time spent on the app
- These rabbit holes are full of fake news
- An MIT study found that fake news spreads 6 times faster than real news
- It is effectively an echo chamber, giving us facts that we believe, and aligns with us, allowing no room for effective and deep discussion and dialog
- If we take anything on social media to effectively be the truth, it can have very bad repercussions
- Since everyone has their own version of reality that they strongly believe, it can be polarise difference groups of people and create tensions, threatening the social fabric
- For example, In the US, people are burning cell towers, due to misinformation that they saw online about how the 5G cell towers are spreading the coronavirus
## People may also be more authentic on social media
- Because social media is asynchronous, difficult interpersonal discussion where one needs take time tot think through and edit what they want to say may lead to a higher level of authenticity than in a face-to-face conversation
### Examples
- Bondee, an app where users can make avatars in the form of cute comic representations of themselves,
- Apps like Bondee can relieve us of any hang-ups we may have about our physical bodies and in a way, give us avatars which may be more representative of what we see as our true personalities
- Online others do not have to interact with people's public personals which are nor necessarily representatives of their inner selves
- But, this can vary it depends on a persons background and personality
- An introvert could feel more comfortable communicating and establishing relationships online, and culture also plays a role
- In South Korea, there is almost an expectation that technology will play a huge role in the formation of relationships, especially romantic ones
## Technology can bring the world closer together
- During the pandemic, where technology was the main means for many people to stay connected while movement restrictions were in place, it us a whole new way of living
- There is arguably already an entire generation who may have spent the better part of their formative years online and have had to learn how to navigate the social world through a digital medium
- Experiencing such interconnectedness may have a positive impact on people’s sense of global or civic community, and inform a wider desire to do good, collectively
- A six-month study of 336 young people in Hong Kong found a positive relationship between interconnectedness and civic duty
## Technology can help coordinate global efforts for a force of good
- Trace labs, an organisation of thousands hackers uses the internet to gather peoples real name, and username, and social media accounts to gather information about the person
- For example, their email address, their frequently visited areas, their job positions
- An Indian boy, who was lost for 25 years as he fell asleep on the train, used Google Earth to find his hometown
- He used the time he fell asleep for and the speed of the trains to create a search radius, and looked at the map on google earth and compared the landmarks such as the waterfall he played in
## AI can pass for human connection
- ChatGPT is a language model that uses deep learning to produce human-like text, and can simulate "human-like conversations"
- They respond to natural language and do no require any coding skills to use, making AI more accessible
### Example
- Koko, a free therapy program, use AI chatbots to respond to about 4,000 users seeking advice through a co-pilot system by having humans supervise the responses that the bot generates
- They found these responses to be more helpful than human responses, allowing some people to even find closure with some emotions they felt, inducing real and tangible feelings
- But, when they realised they had been chatting with a bot, they were unhappy as they felt that the AI was used without their consent and knowledge, and felt it was unethical and misleading
## AI can speed up the art creation process 
- Art can take up a lot of time and effort to create all by hand, and AI can be a tool for doing so
- For example, for Spiderman: Into the Spider-Verse, a movie that redefined the animation medium by making 3D animation look like 2D and more like a comic book, using highly stylised approaches, used their own training data to train an AI model to speed up the animation process
## one more AI good thing
## AI can generate harmful content
- ChatGPT has already been used for creating malware, coming up with chat responses for dating apps, phishing and scamming and disrupting job recruitment
- It is terribly inaccurate in some cases but presents this information in a coherent and factual manner
- It can be used to spread disinformation, especially if more users start wrongly believing that the bot is always right
## AI lacks the human touch
- Usually, a piece of art and work is created with intent, and has its own stories, techniques, flaws and imperfection to convey a human emotion
## AI is very morally sinister
- To train AI art models, the works of several artists online have been stolen, without their knowledge and consent, and without compensation and without credit
- These works may be copyrighted, and AI art may be infringing upon their copyright
- It does not improve upon an artists work, only merely copies bits and pieces it found to be pretty
- As AI trained models are trained on the internet, where various disinformation, rude remarks and other pieces of content rife with toxicity and bias, it quickly became necessary to regulate the content provided
