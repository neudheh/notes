## Question analysis
### Topic areas
- Identify the topic areas your question covers
- You should have an in-depth awareness of the issues that the question raises and relevant example to support your essay
### Point of contention
- The point of contention is the basis for disagreement
> [!NOTE] Example
> Is it always important to succeed?
> **Point of contentnion** - Whether it is always important to succeed
> **Stands**
> 1. It is always important to succeed
> 2. It is not always important to succeed (It is mostly important/ unimportant to succeed)

> [!NOTE] Example
> Women will never enjoy the same rights as men
> **Point of contentnion** - Whether women will enjoy the same rights as men
> **Stands**
> 1. Women will never enjoy the same rights as men
> 2. Women will one day enjoy the same rights as men

### Context
- Context includes 
	- Time (e.g. Today, Modern)
	- Place (e.g. Your society, Developed countries)
	- People (e.g. the old, young people)
- Identify characteristics of the given context and relate them to the issues that the question raises
	- Today - Reliance on science and technology, greater awareness of inequalities, highly interconnected, challenges from climate change, greater threat of terrorism
	- Your society (Singapore) - Highly developed, fast pace of life, highly educated population, ageing population, efficient, stable government, reliant on migrant labour
	- Young people - Developing own identity, still schooling, exploring options, look up to role models
- Ensure that you stay within the given context of the question
### Common question types
#### Simple polarity
- Fairly straight forward question that needs you to take a stand and provide reasons to support it
- May be modified by 'to what extent/ how important', requiring a more nuanced response
#### Absolute
- "always", "all", "never", "ever"
- In most cases, disagree with the absolute view presented
- Arrived at a qualified stand by considering exceptions and/or conditions which the statement would not hold true
- Use qualifying terms (e.g. 'most of the time', 'in most cases', 'only in certain contexts
#### Comparison across time
- "no longer", "still"
- Examine characteristics of the present, and how is it different from/ similar to the past
- Explain how and why such differences and similarities relate to the question
#### Comparison between two entities
- "rather than", "more"
- Consistently compare and contrast the entities throughout the essay
- Set the criteria for comparison (e.g. costs and consequences)
- Avoid writing paragraphs that solely focus on only of the entities
#### One vs. all else
- "main", "key"
- Ensure the focus remains on the entity specified in the question
- When bringing in other factors, there should be clear and consistent comparison
- Consider how the entity specified is linked to other factors (e.g. achieving this thing would enable the county to achieve other important aims)
- Consider the limitations of over-emphasis on the given entity (e.g. overlooking or hurting other factors that are more important in the long term)
#### Appearance/ Ideal vs. reality
- "really"
- Consider if the claim only holds true under certain ideal conditions or at a superficial level
- Explain why and how the situation might be different in reality upon deeper examination
#### Mutual exclusivity
- Explain why and how the entities are in conflict
- Identify the assumption that the two entities must be mutually exclusive
- Explain why they can actually exist or progress at the same time
#### Excessiveness/ inadequacy
- "too much", "not enough"
- Set the criteria for adequacy (e.g. restoration to normal life), or excessiveness (causing harm)
- Consider the negative consequences that arise in order to justify that something is excessive or inadequate
## Brainstorming/ planning
### Trends/ Time
- What has changed since the past
- What has remained the same
- Are there any likely changes in the future
- IS this trend likely to persists/ become worse
- Why has it changed over time
- What contributing factors has made the trend more/ less pronounced
###  Implications/ Impacts
- What the consequences of the issue/ trend
- Refer to SPECTRAM when thinking about impacts in different aspects
>[!NOTE] SPECTRAM
>S=Science/Sports/Sex 
>P=Politics/Philosophy 
>E= Environment/Education/Ethics/Equality 
>C= Culture/Commercialism/Crime 
>T= Technology/Travel/Tradition 
>R=Race/Religion/Rights 
>A =Arts/Activism 
>M= Media/Migration
- What further consequences might there be
- Have the consequences been adequately addressed
### Perspectives
- Whose perspectives can you discuss
- What are the stakeholders' concerns/ interests
- On what levels (individuals/ national/ global) are these perspectives formed
- Who is more likely affected by this issue/ trend
- Considering various perspectives, who do you think is more valid
## Intro
### Background information
- Set the context of the question and grab the reader's attention
- Highlight recent trends and relate them to the question
- Explain the importance of a topic in the world or a specific context
- Introduce a relevant quote and relate it
### Interpretation
- Unpack key terms and assumptions (What does 'equality' and 'realistic' mean)
- Draw the parameters of the discussion (Is this about gender parity between men and women)
- Put these definitions into the opening discussion of the question
### Opposing view
- Acknowledge the opposing view and the main reasons for such a view
- Use language that indicates acknowledgement ('It is true that') or distancing ("Some may argue")
### Supporting arguments
- State your stand, it should be clear and definite, avoid sitting on the fence
- You can also outline reasons for your chosen position
## Essay body
### Point
- Topic sentence, has the main idea/ point/ argument of your paragraph
- Address the question directly
### Elaboration
- Explain your point, providing reasons for the view
- Use TIP to guide you such as
	- T: What has changed since the past
	- I: What are the consequences of this trend (Important!!!)
	- P: Who is likely to be affected by the trend, compared to others
### Examples
- Draw on a range of appropriate, real-world examples to support your analysis
- Be concise
- No personal anecdotes, hypothetical situations, extreme or isolated examples
### Evaluation
- Re-iterate the point, but with more nuance (generally) to show the complexity of the issue
## Rebuttal
- Must be backed with sound reasoning / examples
### Distancing language
- **Claim/ it may appear/ it may be argued** - The view is unproven/ unsubstantiated, sued when you want to cast doubt on what someone is saying by suggesting that there is no evidence to prove that it is true
- **Opponents of the view/ argue that** - Those who disagree with your view, not the claim expressed int he question, and you will need to identify the basis for disagreement
### Reasons
- **Detached from reality** - On the surface, it might appear/ seem that ... has validity, but in reality, it does not
- **Impractical** - In theory/ On paper, this might sound feasible but it is actually not practical
- **Overlooks complexity of issues** - The view is simplistic and does not take fully into account the complexity of the issues covered
- **Overlooks consequences** - Be it as it may, the view overlooks/ ignores the severe consequences that may arise
- **Overlooks facts/ science** - Nevertheless, the above view chooses to ignore the facts/ science that indicates otherwise
- **Overlooks the urgency of the problem**
- **Disregards ethics/ morals/ human rights**
- **Too optimistic/ Pessimistic**
- **Too idealistic**
## Conceding
- The alternative viewpoint can also be valid, under some conditions
### Language at the beginning
- We cannot overlook/ ignore the fact that
- Granted, it is true that
- Admittedly, it has to be accepted that
- It has to be acknowledged/ conceded that
- It is undeniable that
- It must be noted that
### Reasons
- **Only true for a minority** - Nevertheless, this view is only true for this group, which merely forms a minority. The majority has a very different experience
- **Only valid under specific conditions** - However, this situation occurs only when these conditions are present, which is not very often. When these atypical conditions are not present, a very different situation is more likely to occur
- **Just an ideal scenario** - As good as this may sound, it can only happen in an ideal world. Too many difficulties are present that makes this scenario near impossible to achieve
- **Reality is not quite the same as the appearance** -  However, this is only true if the consider the situation at a superficial level. When we analyse it at a deeper level, the reality is somewhat less rosy
- **Not everyone agrees or is willing to cooperate** - Unfortunately, this approach will not work only if all the key players are of one mind. Given that their needs or objectives are likely to differ, the chances of success are quite slim 
- **Resources are limited** - While this solution might bring about outcome that are beneficial, it is very costly and only the richest countries can afford to implement it. For everyone else, it is not very feasible
- **It only works in the short term** - However, the benefits brought about by this approach are likely to be short lived. IN the long term, there are too many trade offs to make this a viable solution
## Conclusion
### Reiterate stand
- Re state your stand
- Include a concise summary of your points
### Insight
- Leave the reader with some food for thought
- Possible solutions, predictions for future developments, hope for the future
