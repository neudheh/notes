## Literals
- Values are known as literals
- Literals can be of any data type
- There are 4 data types in Python
1. Integers (`int`)
2. Floating Point value (`float`)
3. String (`str`)
4. Boolean (`bool`)
- There is also a special `None` value that is used to keep track that a value is missing, or there are no suitable values to be assigned to the variable
## Variables
- Variables are named values
- We can assign a value to a variable as such 
```Python
year = 2021
```
- Whatever comes after the equal sign can be a literal, calculations and other variables
- Python will evaluate what comes after the equals sign first before assigning the variable the value
- A variable is initialised when a values if fdirst stored in it
- A variable only keeps the last stored value that was assigned to it and discards all previous values
### Naming conventions
- Only contain alphanumeric characters and underscores
- Cannot start with a number
- Cannot have spaces of special symbols
- Cannot have Python keywords

## Type casting
- Type casting is converting a value from one type to another
- Use the Python name of the value like a function
```Python
x = 0.5
str(x)
int(12.3)
```
## Integers
- Integers (`int`) are positive and negative whole number, including 0
- The literal format for Python is just the digits written out with a positive negative sign in front
```Python
69
-420
```
- They have no limit, positive or negative, in the whole numbers they can represent
- We can also type out integers in different number systems with their prefixes

|Number system| Prefix|
|-|-|
|Binary| `0b`/ `0B`|
|Octal | `0o`/ `0O`|
|Hexadecimal | `0x`/ `0X`|
- The functions `bin()` and `hex()` can convert a decimal number to binary and hexadecimal respectively
## Floating point value
- A floating-point number (`float`) is a real number
- The literal format of a float is the digits of the float with the decimal point included explicitly
- If theres is no decimal place, Python will treat it as an int
```Python
3.14
-4.20
69.0
```
- Another way to write floats is with an `e`/ `E` in the middle of two numbers
- The second number is the power of 10 the number is to
```Python
314e-2 # equal to 314 X 10 ^ -2 = 3.14 
```
- Floats are not accurate due to the way they are stored
- Thye have to be between $1.79 \times 10^{308}$ and $-1.79 \times 10^{308}$ , or it will be converted to the special value of infinity, represented by `inf` or `-inf`
## Arithmetic operators

|Operators|Function|
|- |-|
|`+`| Addition|
|`-`| Subtraction|
|`*`| Multiplication|
|`/` | Divison|
|`//` | Floor division (Divides the two values and rounds them down to the nearest integer)|
|`%`| Modulus (Returns the remainder of the two values divided by each other)|
|`**`| Exponentiation (To the power of)|

- All of these operators can be used on `int` and `float`
- Division always results in a `float`
- Sometimes, we need to use a variable for a calculation and then update the value with the result
- Python provides us with assignment operators to make it faster to do these operations

|Operator| Example| Equivalent|
|-|-|-|
|`+=`| `x += a`| `x = x + a`|
|`-=`| `x -= a`| `x = x - a`|
|`*=`| `x *= a`| `x = x * a`|
|`/=`| `x /= a`| `x = x / a`|
|`//=`| `x //= a`| `x = x // a`|
|`%=`| `x %= a`| `x = x % a`|
|`**=`| `x **= a`| `x = x ** a`|

## Strings
- Strings (`str`) are a string of characters
- Strings are declared with a single (`'`) or double (`"`)  quotes at the beginning and the end of the string
```Python
"Hello world!"
'Hello mom!'
```
- A multi line string can be declared using 3 single (`'`) or double (`"`)  quotes at the beginning and the end of the string
- But they are mostly only used to make docstrings
```Python
"""
Here I sit and hesitate,
Should I shit or masturbate
"""
```
- We can also create strings with unicode by prefixing `\u` followed by the unicode number for the character
```Python
"\u7434" #This is 琴 wow!!!
```
- We can also create strings by entering the ASCII code of a character into the function `ord()`
```Python
chr("N") # Returns 78
ord(78) # Returns N
```
- The ASCII value of the character can be obtained using `chr()`
- To convert a uppercase to a lowercase letter, we add 32 to its ASCII value
### Escape characters
- Escape character help to include character in a string, which would otherwise result in a syntax error if written as-is
- It can also continue a long string by putting a `\` at the end of the line

|Escape character| Meaning|
|-|-|
|`\\`| Backslash (\\)|
|`\'`| Single quote (')|
|`\"`| Double quote (")|
|`\n` | New line|
|`\t`| Tab|

### Indexing and slicing
- Each character in a string can be accessed by an index
- The first character of the string will be 0
- The last character of the string can also have an index of -1, the second last -2, etc...
- Strings are immutable, meaning we cannot replace a character in the string by using `x[0] = "R"`

```python|
string = "Hello World!"
print(string[0])
print(string[1])
print(string[2])
print(string[-1])
```

```Terminal
H
e
l
!
```
- We can access multiple characters by slicing
- `x[a:b]` returns all character in x from index `a` to `b-1`
- We can specify a third value, c in `x[a:b:c]` to indicate the steps
- C can be negative to go backwards
- Not specifying b slices to the end of the string
- Not specifying a slices from the beginning of the string
- For indexing and slicing, it the index specified is out of the range (i.e. longer than the string), there will be an error
- If a > b, assuming that c is positive, there will be an error
- If c is negative, there will be no error

```Python
string = "Hello world!"
print(string[0:2])
print(string[:4])
print(string[2:])
print(string[0:6:2])
print(string[::-1])
print(string[5: 1: -1])
```

```Terminal
He
Hell
llo World!
Hlo
!dlroW olleH
 oll
```

### Operators
- `+` can be used to join strings
```Python
print("spider" + "man")
```

```Terminal
spiderman
```
- `*` can be used to repeat strings
```Python
print("Miguel O Hara" * 3)
```

```Terminal
Miguel O HaraMiguel O HaraMiguel O Hara
```
### len()
- The `len()` method returned the number of characters in a string
```Python
print(len("Hello"))
```

```Terminal
5
```
### Methods
- All of these methods can be used by `x.method("argument")`

|Method|Description|
|-|-|
|`count(a)`| Count how many times the argument `a` occurs in the string|
|`find(a)`| Returns the index of the argument `a` when it is found in the string, else it returns -1|
|`index()`| Same as find, but it raises an error if not found
| `lower()` | Converts all letters to lowercase and returns it|
| `upper()`| Converts all letters to uppercase and returns it|
|`title()` | Converts the first character of each word to uppercase and returns it|
|`strip(x)`| Removes all whitespace from the beginning and the end of the string.  A value x can be specified to strip `x` amount of character from the beginning and the end|
|`lstrip(x)` | Same as `strip()` but only strips whitespace from the front|
|`rstrip(x)` | Same as `strip()` but only strips whitespace from the back|
|`isalphanum()`| Returns true if a string is alphanumeric, else it returns false|
|`isalpha()`| Returns true if all characters are in the alphabet, else it returns false|
|`isnumeric()`| Returns true if all characters are numbers, else it returns false|
|`isupper()`| Returns true if all character in the string are uppercase, else it returns false|
|`islower()`| Returns true if all characters in the string are lowercase, else it returns false|
|`isspace()`|Returns true if a string if a string only contains whitespace characters, else it returns false|
|`startswith(a)`| Returns true if a string starts with `a`, else it returns false|
|`endswith(a)`| Returns true if a string ends with `a`, else it returns false|
|`split(a)`| Splits a string into a list at a, and returns it|
|`replace(a,b, c)`| Replaces each value of `a` in the string with `b`, `c` times if specified and returns it|

### .format()
- The `format()` value formats the specified values and inserts then into the string's placeholder
```Python
message = "{} is {} this year!".format("neud", 17)
print(message)
```

```Temrinal
neud is 17 this year!
```

- `format()` can take named indexes and numbered indexes
```Python
message = "{name} is {age} this year! {name}'s favourite color is {color}".format(name = "neud", age = 17, color = "green")

message = "{0} is {1} this year! {0}'s favourite color is {2}".format("neud", 17,"green")
```

```
neud is 17 this year! neud's favouite colour is green
neud is 17 this year! neud's favouite colour is green
```

- `format()` can also take in format types inside the placeholders
- Place then after a colon in the order of the table
- Multiple types can be combined, just type them after the other with no separation

|Type| Description|
|-|-|
|`a<b`| Left aligns the result, making it `b` characters long, filling it up with `a`, if a is not specified, it fils it up with spaces|
|`a>b`| Right aligns the result, making it `b` characters long, filling it up with `a`, if a is not specified, it fils it up with spaces|
|`a^b`| Center aligns the result, making it `b` characters long, filling it up with `a`, if a is not specified, it fils it up with spaces|
|`a=b`| Puts a negative sign in front of the number if `b` is negative, then left aligns the result, making it `b` characters long, filling it up with `a`, if a is not specified, it fils it up with spaces|
|`+`| Uses a +/- to indicate if a number is positive or negative|
|`.af`|Makes a number `a` decimal places|
|`.ag`|Makes a number `a` significant places|

### f-strings
- An f string is defined with `f"` or `f'` at the start of a string and `"`/ `'` at the end
- It allows you to format values too, but better
- No types though
```Python
age= 17
name = "neud"
print(f"{name} is {age} this year!")
```

```Terminal
neud is 17 this year!
```
## Booleans
- Booleans are a `True` or `False` value
- Objects also have a true or false value
- `0`, empty strings, empty lists, empty tuples, empty dictionaries, and `None` values have a `false` value
- They can be written as is in an if statement, or evaluated  using `bool()`
```Python
bool("Hello")
x = "Hi!"
if x:
	pass
```
## Boolean operators
- These operators return a boolean when comparing two numbers

|Operator| Function|
|-|-|
|`>`|Greater than|
|`<`| Lesser than|
|`>=`| Greater than or equal to|
|`<=`| Lesser than or equal to|
|`==`| Equal|
|`!=`| Not equal|
- These operators return a boolean when comparing two strings

|Operator| Function|
|-|-|
|`a in b`| If a string `a` is inside string `b`|
|`a in b`| If a string `a` is not inside string `b`|

### Logical operators

| Operator| Function|
|-|-|
|`and`|Return true if both are true|
|`or`| Return true if either one is true|
|`not`| If it is false, return true and vice-versa|
