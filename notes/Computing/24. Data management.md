## Data lifecycle
- Data is information coded and structured for subsequent processing
- It is a sequence of one or more symbols
- Data requires interpretation to become information
- In computers, data is stored digitally, using the binary system of ones and zeros, allowing us to use the computer to store data
- The data life cycle refers to the entire period of time that the data exists in the system
- It encompasses all the stages that the data goes through, from its creation to its eventual disposal, compassing the entire lifespan of data in an organisation or system

## Data privacy
- ==Data privacy is the requirement for data to be accessed by or disclosed to authorised users only==
- It is about keeping data private rather than allowing it to be available in the public domain
- it is important that unauthorised people do not have access to data they are not supposed to have
- But, in today's digitalised society, it is easier than ever to gather a person's data and use it to gain valuable insights, track his/ her movements, or commit fraud
- As services become more available online, the risk of fraudulent use of data increases
- Organisations not only have to restrict access to data that is private to them, but also be responsible under privacy protection legislation to protect the data they collect from individuals
## Data integrity
- ==Data integrity refers to the accuracy and validity of data==
- It covers data in storage, during processing, and in transit
- it can be compromised through 
	- **Errors on input** - Data that is keyed in may be wrongly transcribed; a batch of transaction data can go astray, or keyed in twice by mistake
	- **Errors in operating procedures** - An update program can be ran twice in error, and the quantities on a master file will be updated twice
	- **Program errors** - A new system may have errors in it that may not surface for some time, or errors can be introduced in maintenance, and this could lead to the corruption of files
	- **Viruses** - Files can be corrupted or deleted if the disk becomes infected with a virus
	- **Transmission errors** - Interference or noise in a communication link may cause bits to be wrongly received
- Each time data is replicated or transferred, it should remain intact and unaltered between updates
- Error-checking methods and validation procedures are typically relied on to ensure the integrity of data that is transferred or reproduced without the intention of alteration
## Threats to data
- **Lapse in user's behaviour** - Users may not be careful when dealing with data, such as making errors in entry, or revealing their OTP/ passwords to others
- **Mismanagement by multiple users** - Multiple users working on the same file may accidentally overwrite each other's data, causing data to be inaccurate or invalid
- **Natural disasters** - They may destroy the computer system and/ or storage device physically
- **Unauthorised intrusion into the system** - If the system is vulnerable to hackers, or is the victim of cyberattacks such as a virus, worm, or trojan, data may be corrupted or lost
- **Malicious software** - Malicious software entering the computer system will cause harm to a system and the data stored in it
## Methods to protect data
### Data backup
- Modern storage equipment usually provides built in disk clustering and redundancy in the vent that data in the primary storage is lost or corrupted
- ==Data backup involves creating copies or data and storing them separately==
- It is intended to be used as a safety precaution or prevention against unexpected loss of data due to unintended data corruption, or errors such as a disk drive failing, files being accidentally deleted, or a data centre going offline during a catastrophic event
- It is a short-term solution and may be performed on a regular basis to ensure that data is up to date and readily available in case of a data loss event
### Data archive
- ==Archiving data involves storing data that is not actively used, but kept for historical references or auditing purposes==
- It ensures that important records remain available after years they were created
- In most cases, the purpose of data archiving is to meet legal and compliance requirements
- Backups help with data recovery in the event of data loss, corruption, or hardware failure, while archives help with long-term retention and space management

|                           | Backup                                                                               | Archive                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data storage methods**  | The data remains in place, while a backup copy is stored in another location         | Archived data is moved from its original location to an archive storage location |
| **Data state**            | Backed-up data is constantly changing                                                | Once you create an archive, you do not modify it                                 |
| **Data retention policy** | Data backups that are too old to be useful are periodically deleted or overwritted   | Data archives are designed for long-term storage                                 |
| **Storage type**          | Hot cloud storage or easily accessible local storage locations                       | Cold cloud storage or tape archives                                              |
| **Data scope**            | All of your data, with the exception of unimportant information like temporary files | Specific files to retain for compliance purposes                                 |
### Restricting access
- We can also ensure only authorised users can access our data using
	- **Passwords** - Ensure users follow general guidelines to ensure strong passwords
	- **2FA** - In the form of security tokens or OTP
	- **Biometrics** - In the form of facial recognition and fingerprint scanning
- Such authentication and authorisation controls help us verify credentials and ensure user privileges are applied correctly
- These measures are typically used as a part of identity and access management solution, and in combination with role-based access controls
### Version control
- Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a set of files over time so you can recall specific versions later
- Git is a commonly used version control tool, allowing users to rollback to previous working versions of processes to fix mistakes while minimising disruption to other team members
- Git has 3 main states files can reside in: modified, staged and committed
- Modified means that the file has been changed, but not committed to the database
- Staged means that the modified file in its current version has been marked to go into the next commit snapshot
- Committed means that the data is safely stored in the local database
### File naming conventions
- File naming conventions is a framework for naming files in a way that describes what they contain and how they relate to other files
- This helps to minimise the chances of files being misplaced or lost unintentionally due to poor organisation of files
- Such a convention allows us to find a file easily
- Developing a file naming convention is done by identifying key elements of the project and the important differences and similarities between files
- Best practises
	- Files should be named consistently
	- Files should be short but descriptive
	- Avoid special characters and spaces
	- Use capitals and underscores instead of periods, spaces, or slashes
	- Uses the data format YYYYMMDD
	- Include a version number
	- Write down the naming convention in the data management plan
- Consider putting in the 
	- Date of creation
	- Short description
	- Work
	- Location
	- Project name or number
	- Sample
	- Analysis
	- Version number
### Validation and verification
- Data validation and verification are measures to check data when it is entered into the system, or transmitted from one system to another
### Disaster recovery
- Disaster recovery is a set of practises and technologies that determine how an organisation deals with a disaster, such as a cyberattack, natural disaster, or large-scale equipment failure
- It involves setting up a remote disaster recovery site with copies of protected systems and switching operations to those systems in times of disaster
### Encryption
- Encryption alters data content according to an algorithm that can only be reversed with the right encryption key
- Encryption protects data from unauthorised access event if data is stolen, by making it unreadable
### Erasure
- Data erasure is more secure than data wiping because it uses software to completely overwrite data on any storage device
- It verifies that data is unrecoverable, and limits liability by deleting data that is no longer needed
- This can be done after data is processed and analysed, or periodically when data is no longer relevant
- Erasing unnecessary data is a requirement of many compliance regulations
## Personal data
- ==Personal data is data about an individual who can be identified from the data, or from the data and other information which the organisation has or is likely to have access==
- Can include
	- Names
	- Contact numbers
	- NIRC or passport number
	- Photograph or video image of an individual
	- Email address
	- Thumbprint
	- Address
	- Any other data that forms part of an individual's record
## PDPA
- The Personal Data Protection Act (PDPA) is a data protection law that protects against the misuse of personal data by governing the collection, use, disclosure, and care of personal data in Singapore
- It recognises the rights of individuals to protect their personal data, including rights of access and correction
- It also recognises the needs of organisations to collect, use, and disclose personal data for legitimate uses
- By regulating the flow of personal data among organisations, the PDPA strengthens Singapore's position as a trusted hub for business
- Organisations are required with the various data protection obligations if they undertake activities relating to the collection, use, and disclosure of personal data
### 1. Accountability Obligation
- Undertake measures to ensure organisations meet their obligations under the PDPA
- E.g. making information about data protection policies, practises, and complaints processes available upon request
- Designate a data protection officer (DPO) and make the business contact information available to the public
### 2. Notification obligation
- Notify individuals of the purposes for which the organisation is intending to collect, use, or disclose their personal data
### 3. Consent obligation
- Only collect, use, and disclose personal data which an individual has given consent to
- Allow the individual to withdraw consent, within reasonable notice, and inform them of the likely consequences of withdrawal
- Once consent is withdraw, cease to collect, use, or disclose the individuals personal data
### 4. Purpose limitation obligation
- Only collect, use, or disclose personal data for the purposes a reasonable person would consider appropriate under the given circumstances, and for which the individual has given consent 
- An organisation may not, as a condition of providing a product or service, require the individual to consent to the collection, use, or disclosure of their personal data beyond what is reasonable to provide the product or service
### 5. Accuracy obligation
- Make reasonable efforts to ensure that personal data collected is accurate and complete, especially if it is used to make a decision that affects the individual, or to be disclosed to another organisation
### 6. Protection obligation
- Reasonable security arrangements have to be made to protect personal data in the organisations possession to prevent unauthorised access, collection, use, disclosure, or similar risks
### 7. Retention limitation obligation
- Cease retention of personal data or dispose of it in a proper manner when it is no longer needed for any business or legal purpose
### 8. Transfer limitation obligation
- Transfer personal data to another country only according to the requirements prescribed under the regulation, to ensure that the standard of protection is comparable to the protection under the PDPA, unless exempted by the PDPC
### 9. Access and correction obligation
- Upon request, organisations have to provide individuals with access to their personal data, as well as information about how it was used or disclosed within a year before the request
- Organisations are required to correct any error or omission in an individual's personal data as soon as possible and send the correct the data to other organisations to which the personal data was disclosed (or select organisations the individuals has consented to), within a year before the correction is made
### 10. Data breach notification obligation
- In the event of a data breach, organisations must take steps to assess if it is notifiable
- If the breach results in significant harm to individuals, and/ or are of significant scale, organisations are to notify the PDPC and the affected individuals as soon as possible
#### 11. Data Portability Obligation
- Organisations are required to transmit the individual’s data that is in the organization’s possession or under its control, to another organization in a commonly used machine-readable format upon request
