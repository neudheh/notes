## Abstract data types
- An abstract data type is a collection of data, that can
	- Create a new instance of the data structure
	- Insert a new element into the data structure
	- Delete an element in the data structure
	- Find/ update an element in the data structure
- Abstract data types use dynamic memory allocation
## Arrays
- An array is a collection of times that are stored at contiguous (adjacent) memory locations
- It can only hold a fixed number of items, of the same type
## Linked list
- A linked list is a dynamic data structure, which holds a collection of elements
- Each element may not be stored in contiguous memory locations, but whatever location is available
- Each element is linked into an ordered sequence using pointers
- A linked list is better as adding or deleting doesn't require us to shift each item, we only need to change the pointers, and everything can be done in $O(1)$ complexity
### Nodes
- An element in a linked list is called a node
- Each node has data and a pointer which points to the next element
- A pointer that does not point to anything, indicating no further nodes is called a null pointer, represented by $\emptyset$
- The start/ head of a pointer stores the address of the first element of the linked list
### Singly linked list
- A singly linked list is a collection of nodes, each with one pointer pointing to the next node
- The start pointer points to the first node, and the last node points to $\emptyset$
- We can only travel forward along the list

## Creating a linked list
- Create a node with a `data` and a `next` pointer which points to the next node in the listÂ 
![[linked list node.png]]
```python
class Node:
	def __init__(self, data):
	self.data = data
	self.next = None
```
- To initialise the linked list,
```Python
class LinkedList:
	def __init__(self):
		self.start = None
```
- We create a `start` pointer, and set it to none as the linked list is empty
## Inserting a node
### At the beginning
- The `next` pointer in the new node has to point to the contents of the `start` pointer
- The `start` pointer then points to the new node
![[linked list inserting a new node at the beginning.png]]
### At the end
- The pointer of the last node points to the new node
- The pointer of the new node is null pointer
![[linked list inserting a new node at the end.png]]
### In between
- The pointer of the new node points to the next node
- The pointer of the previous node points to the new node
![[linked list inserting a node in between.png]]
```pseudo
PROCEDURE insert(self, data)
	new_node <- Node(data)
	IF self.start IS NONE // empty linked list
		THEN
			self.start <- new_node
		ELSE
			// traverses through the linked list
			curr <- self.start
			WHILE curr IS NOT NONE OR data > curr.data DO
				prev <- curr
				curr <- curr.next
			ENDWHILE
			// insert at the start
			IF curr = self.start
				THEN
					new_node.next <- self.start
					self.start <- new_node
				ELSE // insert at the end/ in between
				new_node.next <- curr
				prev.next <- new_node
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Deleting a node
### At the start
- To delete a node at the start, update the start pointer to the next pointer
![[linked list deleting first node.png]]
### At the end
- To delete a node at the end, update the pointer of the node before the last node to a null pointer
![[linked list deleting last node.png]]
### In between
- To delete a node in between, make the node before the node to be deleted point to the node after
![[linked list deleting node in between.png]]
```pseudo
PROCEDURE delete(self, data)
	IF self.head IS NONE // empty linked list
		THEN
			OUTPUT "Linked list is empty"
		ELSE // traverse the linked list
			curr <- self.head
			WHILE curr IS NOT NONE AND curr.data <> data DO
				prev <- curr
				curr <- curr.next
			ENDWHILE
			IF curr IS NONE
				THEN
					OUTPUT "Data does not exist"
				ELSE
					IF curr = self.head // deleteing at the start
						THEN
							self.head <- self.head.next
						ELSE
							/// deleting in between/ at the end
							prev.next = curr.next
					ENDIF
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Searching for data
```pseudo
FUNCTION search(self, data) RETURNS BOOLEAN
	IF self.head IS NONE
		THEN
			OUTPUT "Linked list is empty"
			RETURN False
		ELSE
			curr <- self.head
			WHILE curr IS NOT NONE and curr.data <> data DO
				curr <- curr.next
			ENDWHILE
			IF curr IS NONE
				THEN
					OUTPUT "Data not found"
					RETURN FALSE
				ELSE
					OUTPUT "Data found"
					RETURN TRUE
			ENDIF
	ENDIF
ENDFUNCTION
```
## Accessing all nodes in the linked list
```
PROCEDURE display(self)
	IF self.start IS NONE
		OUTPUT "Linked list is empty"
	ELSE
		curr <- self.head
		WHILE curr IS NOT NONE DO
			OUTPUT curr.data
			curr <- curr.next
		ENDWHILE
ENDPROCEDURE
```
## Free space list
- But, nodes that are deleted will remain in the array and no longer be accessible as no pointer will point to it
- This space, which is free, is wasted
- One way of managing this is to have two linked lists, one for the actual data, and one for free space
- A free space list can be made by linking unused nodes
- New nodes can be made by using the unused nodes, and nodes that are deleted are returned to the free space list
![[free space list.png]]
### Insertion
1. Check if there are any unused nodes in the free space list
2. Set a `new_node` pointer to point to the index that the `next_free` pointer is pointing to
3. Store the data into the new node at the index the `new_node` pointer is pointing at
4. Set the `new_free` pointer to point to the index of the new free node
5. Traverse the linked list to find the correct position to insert the new node
6. If inserting at the start, set the `next` pointer of the new node to point to the contents of the `start` pointer, then update the start pointer to point to the new node
7. To insert in between, set the new pointer of the new node to the index of the next node, and the previous node points to the index of the new node
![[free space list inserting.png]]
### Deleting
1. Check if the linked list is empty
2. Traverse the linked list, and find if the data exists in the nodes
3. To delete the first node, set the `start` pointer to the index of the `next` pointer in the node to be deleted
4. To delete a node in between, set the `next` pointer of the previous node to point to the `next` pointer of the node to be deleted
5. Update the `next` pointer in the node to be deleted to the index in the `nextfree` pointer
6. Update `nextfree` to point to the new node
## Memory allocation
- Memory allocation is the process where computer programs and services are assigned with physical or virtual memory space
- The memory allocation is done before or at the time of program allocation
- There are two types: static memory allocation, and dynamic memory allocation

| Static memory allocation                                                                     | Dynamic memory allocation                                                                                        |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Memory is allocated at compile time                                                          | Memory is allocated at runtime                                                                                   |
| The size and location of memory blocks is fixed and cannot be changed at runtime             | The size and location of memory blocks and be changed and allocated according to the program logic and data size |
| Allocated memory remains from start to the end of the program                                | Allocate memory can be released at any time during the program                                                   |
| It is inflexible and wasteful if actual memory usage is lesser than allocated                | It is flexible and efficient as memory is allocated according to required usage                                  |
| It is fast and simple as there is no need to allocate or deallocate memory during allocation | It is slower and more complex as you have to manage the memory allocation and deallocation yourself              |
| Avoids memory fragmentation as memory blocks are contiguous and aligned                      | May cause memory fragmentation                                                                                   |
| Preferred in arrays                                                                          | Preferred in linked lists                                                                                        |
