## SQL
- SQL (Structured Query Language) is a standard computer language used to operate and manage databases
- It can perform create, read, update, and delete operations (CRUD) on a database
## SQLite
- SQLite is an SQL engine
- It has `INTEGER`, `TEXT`, `REAL`, `NUMBERIC`, and `BLOB` data types
- SQL does not have have a boolean type, these are stored as 1 for true and 0 for false
## Create
- To create a table, we can set constraints, which are rules enforced on data columns on a table
- Some commonly used are
	- `NOT NULL` - a field cannot be empty or have a `NULL` value
	- `UNIQUE` - all values in the column are different
	- `PRIMARY KEY` - combination of `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`, used to uniquely identify each row/ record in a table
	- `AUTOINCREMENT` - value increases automatically with each new record added
	- `FOREIGN KEY` - references to the `PRIMARY KEY` in another table, helping to enforce relationships between tables, preventing invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column because it has to be one of the values in the referenced table

```SQL
CREATE TABLE table_name (
	column1_name COLUMN1_TYPE COLUMN1_CONSTRAINTS,
	column2_name COLUMN2_TYPE COLUMN2_CONSTRAINTS,
	/* for composite primary keys*/
	PRIMARY KEY (column1_name, column2_name,…) 
	FOREIGN KEY (column1_name) REFERENCES table_name(column_name)
);
```
Example
```SQL
CREATE TABLE Borrower (
	ID INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
	FirstName TEXT NOT NULL,
	LastName TEXT NOT NULL,
	Contact TEXT NOT NULL
);
```

*Autoincrement can only be used on the primary key*

### Inserting data
```SQL
INSERT INTO Borrower (FirstName, LastName, Contact) 
VALUES ("Peter", "Tan", "999");
```
- The ID field can be excluded as it is auto incrementing
- else, SQL will insert a `NULL` value automatically
## Update
```SQL
UPDATE Borrower SET Contact = "995" WHERE ID = 1;
```
- `WHERE` works like if
- Suppose we have a table called `Book`
![[Pasted image 20240221002010 1.png]]
- We want to add 'Book: ' to the begeinning of every title, which can by done by running
```SQL
UPDATE Book SET Title = "Book: " || Title;
```
- `||` concatenates strings
![[Pasted image 20240221002131 1.png]]
## Delete
```SQL
DELETE FROM Book WHERE ID = 123
```
- This will delete the H2 computing ten year series (god bless) from `Book`
- It is case sensitive
- This statement will delete all the records, leaving an empty table
```SQL
DELETE FROM Book
```
- To delete a table and its contents, use `DROP`
```SQL
DROP TABLE Book
```
## Read
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book
```
- This selects all the columns in book
```SQL
SELECT ID, Title FROM Book
```
- This selects the `ID` and `Title` field of all the books in library
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book WHERE Damaged. = 1
```
- This statement will display all fields of all the damaged books.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book WHERE PublisherID IS NULL
```
- This statement will display all fields of books with no publishers (no value on the `PublisherID` field)
- The `IS` operator is used to check for `NULL` values.
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book WHERE Title = 'Life of Pie' AND Damaged = 0
```
- This statement returns the books with Title ‘Life of Pie’ and are not damaged.
## ORDER BY
- The sequence of display or records can also be in either ascending order (default), or depending order
```SQL
SELECT ID, Title
FROM Book
WHERE Damaged = 1
ORDER BY Title DESC;
```
- This gets the ID and Title of the Books that are damaged and orders them by title in descending order
## GROUP BY
- `GROUP BY` is often used with aggregate functions to group the results
### Aggregate Functions
- Aggregate functions help to count/ calculate results from the database

|Aggregate function|Description|
|-|-|
|COUNT|Number of values|
|MAX|Maximum value|
|MIN|Minimum value|
|SUM|Sum of all values|
|AVG|Average of values|
```SQL
SELECT Damaged, Count(ID)
FROM Book
WHERE PublisherID IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY Damaged
```
- This query will count the number of books with a PublisherID and group the count according to damaged and not damaged.
## AS
- We can rename columns by using `AS`
```SQL
SELECT Title AS BookTitle FROM Book
```
- This gets the `Titles` of the books, and renames it to `BookTitle`
## JOIN
- There are three types of join, implicit, explicit and left outer
- Implicit and explicit join returns the cartesian product of rows from the tables in the join
- But, this results in many unnecessary rows
### Implicit Join
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book, Publisher WHERE Book.PublisherID = Publisher.ID
```
### Explicit join
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book
JOIN Publisher
ON Book.PublisherID. = Publisher.ID
```
### Left outer join
- This returns all the rows in `Book`, even those with a `PublisherID` of `NULL`, as `Book` is on the Left
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Book
LEFT OUTER JOIN Publisher
ON Book.PublisherID = Publisher.ID
```
