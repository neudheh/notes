## Denary
- The number system we use everyday
- Base 10 - 10 distinct digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 
- Each digit is a power to the 10 higher than the previous
- Consider $346 = (3 \times 10^2) + (4 \times 10^1) + (2 \times 10^0)$
## Binary
- Binary system is used by computers
- Base 2 - 2 Distinct digits: 0, 1
- Each digit is a power to the 2 higher than the previous
- A binary digit is called a bit
- A group of 8 bits is called a byte
- Consider $101110 = (1 \times 2^5) + (0 \times 2^4) + (1 \times 2^3) + (1 \times 2^2) + (1 \times 2^1) + (0 \times 2^0) = 46$
## Hexadecimal
- Base 16- 16 distinct digits: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, A, B, C, D, E, F
- A to F represent denary values 10 to 15
-  Each digit is a power to the 16 higher than the previous
- Consider $2A6 = (2 \times 16 ^ 2) + (10 \times 16 ^ 1) + (6 \times 16 ^ 0) = 678$
