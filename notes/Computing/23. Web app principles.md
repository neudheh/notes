## Applications
### Native applications
- Native applications are installed directly on the device that can work with no internet connection depending on the nature of the application
- They are developed for a specific platform or operating system (e.g. iOS, Android, Windows)
- They can take advantage of device features such as the power of the processor, specific hardware such as GPS and other components of the system such as notifications
- More safe and secure than web apps, as they must be approved by the app store
### Web applications
- Web applications are a software application accessed and used through a web browser
- Users do not need to download and install web applications on their device
- They can be accessed by any device with a browser and an internet connection, regardless of the operating system
- They are developed as web pages in HTML and CSS, while interactive components of the application are developed in programming languages such as JavaScript

| Better and more consistent user experience as they fill the screen and take control of the whole device         | Less consistency in user experience as certain features or images may look different on different browsers, as the window can be resized, and buttons and menu bar features look different on mobile devices |
## Jakob Nielsen's 10 usability principles
- User interface (UI) refers to the screens, buttons, toggles, icons and other visual elements that user interact with when using a website or app
- User experience (UX) refers to the interaction users have with a product, including how they feel about the interaction
### 1. Visibility of system status
- The application design should always update users on the system's current status clearly
- Prompt and meaningful feedback should be provided so that users can determine the next steps
- This will build trust in the system
- E.g. loading bars
### 2. Match between system and the real world
- Terms, icons, images, concepts, and words should be familiar to the user rather than system oriented terms
- This can be done by following real world conventions so that the information can appear in a natural and logical order, which leads to desired outcomes
- This is known as natural mapping
- Users can easily learn how to use the interface, enhancing user experience
### 3. User control and freedom
- Accommodate user's mistakes by allowing them to undo and redo easily
- Provides users a clear way to exit any unwanted state or interaction
- This give users a sense a freedom and control, and avoids any frustration of getting stuck at a certain state
### 4. Consistency and standards
- It is important to improve user's learnability by ensuring internal and external consistency in using words, symbols, and actions
- Internal consistency refers to ensuring that your application follows consistent conventions and design patterns throughout the interface
- E.g. Using the same button styles and colours for similar actions within a product
- External consistency refers to following industry conventions
- Users spend more time using other apps, and have expectations of your app
- Failing the maintain this consistency would increase the cognitive load of the user as they are force to learn something new or opposite of what they are used to
### 5. Error prevention
- Web apps should be designed in a way to prevent potential problems
- This can be done by eliminating error-prone conditions or confirming with the users before they commit to an action
- Slips are unconscious errors caused by inattention
- They can be prevented by providing helpful constraints and good defaults
- Mistakes are conscious errors based on a mismatch between a user's mental model and the design
- This can be prevented by letting users undo an action, or warning or notifying users before they execute the actions
- They must minimise the user's memory load to lower the probability of them making a mistake
### 6. Recognition rather than recall
- Humans have limited short-term memories, and interfaces that promote recognition reduce the amount of cognitive effort required from users
- User's memory load can be minimised by making the elements, actions, and options in application visible and easily retrievable
- The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another
- E.g. Putting a label next to a button, making it visible and easily retrievable
### 7. Flexibility and efficiency of use
- Allows more experienced users a faster and more efficient exprience
- This can be done through keyboard shortcuts and touch gestures that are hidden from novice users
- Users can personalise how they interact with the application by customising or tailoring their frequent actions, contents, and other functions
- This can be done by letting users select how they want the product to work
### 8. Aesthetic and minimalist design
- The content and visual interface of the UI should focus on the essentials, and not contain irrelevant content or rarely needed information
- Every extra bit of information competes with other units of information, and reduces their visibility
- It is important to not distract users with unnecessary elements and ensure they support the users primary goals
### 9. Help users recognise, diagnose, and recover from errors
- Helpful error messages are vital in web applications
- They should attract users immediate attention by ensuring that error messages follow the traditional visuals such as bold red text
- They should be expressed in simple language and not in error codes or technical jargon
- They should indicate the problem, and suggest constructive suggestions to solve the problem
### 10. Help and documentation
- Help and documentation helps users understand how to use the app, and how to complete their tasks
- These should be easy to search and tailor to the context they are in
## ASCII
- ASCII only uses 7 bits to represent 128 characters
- Hexadecimal digits are often used to express ASCII codes as only 2 hexadecimal digits are needed, which is more compact than 3 decimal digits or 7 binary digits
## Unicode
- Unicode provides a number for every character, no matter what the platform, program, or language is
- Used to represent languages like Tamil and Mandarin
- Unicode uses 8-32 bits to represent characters, allowing it to represent over a million characters
- If unicode numbers were stored as binary numbers, each character needs 21 digits, using 21 bits
- This is wasteful, as not all characters are used equally often
- But, frequently used character use fewer bits, while rarely used ones use more bits, hence they use 8 to 32 bits
