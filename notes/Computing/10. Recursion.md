- A recursive function is defined in terms of itself
- It has 3 main features
	1. It is defined in terms of itself
	2. It calls itself with one or more similar but smaller problems
	3. It repeats itself until a base case is reached
- Recursion is more elegant and uses less code than iterative solutions
- A complex task can be broken down into simpler sub-problems using recursion, while iterative solutions may be hard to program
- A recursive solution to a mathematical problem that is recursive in nature is easier to design than an iterative one
- But, recursion takes up a lot of memory and processing time from the multiple function calls
- Each time it stores return addresses and copies of local or temporary variables in memory
- If the recursion continues too long, the computer may run out of memory and the program will raise a runtime error
## Trace tables
- Trace tables are used to test an algorithm and predict step-by-step how the computer will run the algorithm
- They also test the logic of the algorithm if there are errors that are not easily spotted
- Each column in a trace table represents a variable, a condition, or an output
- Trace tables simulate what the computer would do if the program were to run
- We have to complete the table to show how the variables change, what the conditions would resolve to, and what outputs will be displayed
```Python
def sum_num(num):
	total = 0
	while num >= 0:
		total += num
		num -= 1
	return total
```

| num | total | num>=0 | Return value |
| --- | ----- | ------ | ------------ |
| 5   | 0     | True   |              |
| 4   | 5     | True   |              |
| 3   | 9     | True   |              |
| 2   | 12    | True   |              |
| 1   | 14    | True   |              |
| 0   | 15    | True   |              |
| -1  | 15    | False  |              |
|     |       |        | 15           |
### Recursive
```Python
def sum_num(num):
	if num == 0:
		return 0
	else:
		return num + sum_num(num-1)
```

| Call number | Function call | num | num == 0 | Return Value   |
| ----------- | ------------- | --- | -------- | -------------- |
| 1           | sum_num(5)    | 5   | False    | 5 + sum_num(4) |
| 2           | sum_num(4)    | 4   | False    | 4 + sum_num(3) |
| 3           | sum_num(3)    | 3   | False    | 3 + sum_num(2) |
| 4           | sum_num(2)    | 2   | False    | 2 + sum_num(1) |
| 5           | sum_num(1)    | 1   | False    | 1 + sum_num(0) |
| 6           | sum_num(0)    | 0   | True     | 0              |
| 5           | sum_num(1)    | 1   | False    | 1 (1+0)        |
| 4           | sum_num(2)    | 2   | False    | 3 (1+2)        |
| 3           | sum_num(3)    | 3   | False    | 6 (3+3)        |
| 2           | sum_num(4)    | 4   | False    | 10 (4+6)       |
| 1           | sum_num(5)    | 5   | False    | 15 (5+10)      |
## Trace tree
- A trace tree shows the flow of recursion
- Show the calling and the returning of values

## More complex example
```python
def fib_r(n):
	if n <= 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return fib_r(n-1) + fib_r(n-2)
```

## Stacks
- When a function is called, a certain amount of memory is set aside for the function to use to store local variables and a functions address
- This is memory is known as a stack frame
- This allows the program to return to the proper place after a function call
- When a function calls another function, the callers stack space is kept intact and a new pace is made to handle the function call
- When a function has finished its work and returns to the caller, the associated space is released

### Example
```python
def factorial_r(n):
	if n == 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial_r(n-1)
print(factorial_r(4))
```
