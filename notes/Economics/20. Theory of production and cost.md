## Firms
- Firms are organizations that bring together factors of production to produce goods and services
- They aim to maximize total profits (Total profit = Total revenue - Total cost)
- Firms will be concerned about how their costs are changing and will aim to produce using the least cost method
- In the short run, there is at least one fixed factor of production, while in the long run all factors of production are variable
- Explicit costs are actual monetary payments made to owners of factors of production for the use of factors of production not owned by the firm (e.g. worker's wages)
- Implicit costs are costs of using FOPs that does not involve a direct payment to another part (e.g. opportunity cost of using FOP that the firm already owns)
## Production and costs in the short run
### Types of costs in the short run
- Fixed costs are costs that do not vary with the level of output with the firm, and will be incurred even if the firm shuts down and stops production (e.g. rent)
- Variable costs are costs that vary positively with the level of output, and will be zero if the firms stops production (e.g. wages)
- Total cost = Total fixed cost + Total variable cost
- Marginal cost is the addition to total cost from an additional unit of output
- Average total cost is the total cost per unit output
- Average fixed cost is the fixed cost per unit output
- Average variable cost is the variable cost per unit output
### Law of diminishing marginal returns
- ==The law of diminishing marginal returns states that as additional units of a variable factor are added to the fixed factor, the resulting addition to total output will decline==
### Cost curves
![[the cost curves.png]]
- Marginal cost is the additional cost resulting from the production of an additional unit of output
	- It is a U-shaped curve, which declines until it reaches a minimum and rises
	- The variable factor (e.g. labor) is hired at a fixed price
	- If more labor is hired resulting in increasing quantities of additional output, the the marginal cost must be falling
	- But, once diminishing returns to labor sets in, it will take more labor to make each additional unit of output, and marginal cost will rise
- Average total cost is the total cost per unit of output
	- It is also a U-shaped curve which declines until it reaches a minimum and rises
	- The marginal cost curve must cut the average total cost curve at the minimum
	- If MC is less then ATC, then ATC must be falling, and if MC is more than ATC, then ATC must be rising
	- When MC is equal to ATC, ATC is at a minimum
## Production and costs in the long run
- In the long run, all factors of production are variable, and thus firms are able to change its scale of production (change all factors of production by the same proportion)
- Firms will increase production if it allows it to reap internal economies of scale (EOS)
- Internal EOS is a decrease in the firm's unit cost of production when the firm expands beyond a certain size
- Internal diseconomies of scale (dis-EOS) is an increase in firm's unit cost of production when its scale of production increases
- When an industry grows, firms can experience external EOS, where a firm, regardless of size, is able to enjoy lower unit costs when the industry it operates in expands
- External dis-EOS is a decrease in a firm's unit cost of production, regardless of size, when the industry expands beyond a certain size
## Reasons for internal EOS
### Increased productivity
- As a firms expands, there is room for increases specialization for capital and labor, leads to a more efficient organization of the production process, lowering unit cost
- Workers can be divided to performs specific tasks like transporting, assembling, testing
- As a worker repeatedly performs a specific task, he specializes and becomes better at it, improving labor productivity
- Assuming wage rates remain constant, the wage cost is spread over a larger output level, and unit costs are lower
- Larger firms can afford specialized departments and people doing specific administrative operations such as human resources
- This results in greater productivity, lowering unit costs
### Spreading out of fixed costs
- Some capital equipment greatly improve efficiency, but need huge capital outlay and are indivisible (not available in smaller units)
- E.g. large printing presses only come in large sizes and are expensive
- A printing firm can only acquire the machine if there is a large enough output such that the cost of buying the machine can be distributed over a larger output
- This helps to bring the unit cost down
- Fixed costs can also be spread out over a larger volume of output for a larger firm (e.g. advertising), leading to a fall in average cost
- Large firms also produce a range of products, and advertising for one product will also promote other product, lowering the firm's average cost
### Increased dimension
- With an increase in the scale of production, firms will see that cost increases less than proportionately, leading to a fall in unit cots
- If the external dimensions of a taker are doubled, it can carry 8 times the amount of cargo, but needs less than 8 times the amount of resources to build and operate
- The unit cost falls with the use of the larger storage space
### Greater buying power
- Larger firms are able to get bulk discounts as they place large orders, leading to lower costs
- They also get bank loans with lower interest rate, as banks think larger firms are more stable and less risky
- It is easier issue shares and bonds to raise funds, and they can obtain funds at a lower unit cost
## Reasons for internal dis-EOS
### Difficulties in communication and coordination
- As the size of a firm increases, many specialised departments are created
- This can give rise to problems of coordination as these departments may have conflicting objectives
- Problems of control both between and within departments will also arise because of difficulties in monitoring all the different operations
- There could be increased red tape and paper work, leading to higher costs and greater inefficiency
- Administrative costs may arise and firms may be slower in responding to changing market conditions
- Productivity may drop, increasing unit cost of production
### Morale of workers
- If specialisation is carried out to an extreme extent, doing the same thing all the time can lead to boredom
- Decline in labor relations may arise due to an increased hierarchical structure
- Workers become less motivated because they become seemingly less empowered to make independent decisions
- This causes productivity to drop and higher unit costs of production
## Shape of the LRAC curve
- As a firm expands its scale of production, it is able to reduce its unit cost of production of producing a good as it is reaping internal EOS
- But once it goes beyond a certain point, it starts to suffer internal dis-EOS
- This gives rise the the U-shaped long run average cost (LRAC) curve
- All points on the LRAC curve are productive efficient
- The output level at which the LRAC reaches its minimum is known as the minimum efficient scale, and beyond that the firm stops to enjoy internal EOS
![[LRAC curve.png]]
- If MES is achieved at low levels of output, the firm is small, as these firms have limited EOS due to the nature of production
- If MES is achieved at high levels of output, the firm is large as these firms can reap large EOS, being able to use large complex machine or specialisation that is cost efficient
- If the LRAC is minimum over a range of output, the industry has firms of varying sizes, and MES is achieved at $Q_3$ but remains at the minimum up to output $Q_4$
## Reasons for external EOS
### Outsourcing production
- As the industry grows, greater specialisation in the form of outsourcing of the production of intermediate components may occur
- A firms does not need to undertake the production of every single component of the finished product, and can buy them more cheaply from supporting firms
- These firms are specialised at producing such components, and can reap internal EOS as they would be manufacturing for other firms as well, and thus have lower unit costs
- The cost of transport and communication have fallen, making is possible for companies to split up their production lines into different production facilities
- Each stage of production occurs not just in a separate factory but in an entirely different country
- This is facilitated by the international trading system and the creation of global supply chains
### Tap on common resources
- Some industries are concentrated in a specific geographical area, and can reap benefits (e.g. better transport links, common infrastructure, supply of skilled workers)
- Training schools provide relevant courses start to establish themselves in the region, building a pool of skilled workers that are available for the industry
- This allows firms to cut down on training costs
- Also, this can attract skilled workers to the area, and they will spend lesser time searching for the skilled labor, reducing labor search costs
- As the industry grows, independent research centres (e.g. universities) may focus more of their R&D on the industry
- R&D costs are spread out among the different firms involved in the research, lowering unit costs for all firms
- There is greater scope for mutual cooperation fin R&D to develop common industry standards so there will be less duplication
## Reasons for external dis-EOS
### Increased competition
- There might be increased competition among the firms for the same factors of production, resulting in rising prices of inputs
- If firms are competing for the same labor that has the same skillset, they will have to offer higher wages to attract new workers, increasing factor prices to rise
- This leads to an increase in unit cost of production
### Over-utilisation of common infrastructure
- Over-utilisation of common infrastructure such as roads can lead to traffic congestion, and higher transport costs
- The firm has to find new means to solve or mitigate these new problems, increasing unit costs of production
### Shifting the LRAC curve
- External EOS causes a downward shift of the firms LRAC curve from $LRAC$ to $LRAC'$
- External dis-EOS causes an upward shift of the firms LRAC curve from $LRAC$ to $LRAC''$
