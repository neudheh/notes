## Inflation
- ==Inflation is a situation where there is a sustained increase in the GPL of an economy==
- The GPL is the average price of al goods and services in the economy during a period of time
- Inflation is an economy wide phenomenon, where there is a continued increase in the GPL
- The consumer price index measures the changes in price of a fixed basket of goods and services commonly purchased by the average household over time
- Stagflation is when there is a situation of high unemployment and rapid inflation, with negligible growth, or even contraction in national output
- Disinflation is when the inflation rate is positive, but declining over time
### Real value of money
- The real value of a unit of money is its purchasing power, or the quantity of goods and services that it can buy
- Inflation leads to a decrease in the real value of money, as when prices of goods and services rise in general, the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services
- Internal value of money is its domestic purchasing power, while external value of money is its foreign exchange rate
## Demand-pull inflation
- Demand pull inflation is due to continuing rises in AD when the economy is near or full employment

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand pull inflation.png]]
>- Initially, the economy is at equilibrium GPL $P_1$ and national output $Y_1$
>- When AD rises from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$, firms will increase production
>- When firms increase output and operate closer to the full employment level of output $Y_f$, production becomes less efficient
>- Firms will be forced to resort to inefficient combinations of factors of production
>- Thus, increasingly larger amount of labor and other inputs are required per additional unit of output produced, causing unit cost of production to increase
>- Firms will only produce extra output if it can be sold at higher prices
>- Hence, the rise in AD led a rise in national output, it also rise in the GPL
>- When AD rises further from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, the GPL is further pulled upwards with limited increases in national output
>- Once $Y_f$ is reached, when AD rises from $AD_3$ to $AD_4$ will only lead to increases in GPL
## Causes in rise of AD
- Non-monetary factors - (e.g. increases in AD due to increase in consumer spending (C)/  investment spending (I)/ export revenue (X-M)/  government expenditure (G))
- Monetary factors, as when the country's money supply increases and exceeds money demand, people will spend the excess money on goods and services
- This would lead to a rise in consumer spending (C), leading to a rise in AD
- If the economy is near or at full employment, GPL will rise
- Hence, inflation is caused due to too much money chasing after too few goods and services in the economy
## Cost-push inflation
- Cost-push inflation is when prices is pushed upwards by continual increases in unit costs of production which are not caused by increases in AD

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[cost push inflation.png]]
>- Initially, the economy is at equilibrium GPL $P_1$ and national output $Y_1$
>- When there is a rise in unit cost of production, firms will be willing to continue to produce at the same output level only if they receive higher prices
>- Thus, AS falls, and the horizontal segment of AS shifts up to $AS_2$
>- This will cause equilibrium GPL to rise to $P_2$ as firm pass on higher units costs onto consumers as higher prices, while national output falls to $Y_2$
>- If the cost-push pressure continues, then AS will continue to fall while the horizontal section of AS continues to shift up to $AS_3$, and GPL continues to rise

- A fall in AS causes stagflation (prices rise and real national output falls)
## Causes of cost-push inflation
### Wage push
- Countries with a shrinking labour force, due to an ageing population or government's policies on immigration, might suffer wage push inflation
- This is because a shrinking labor force leads to labour shortages, driving up wage rates
---
- Trade unions can push up wage rates independently of the demand for labor, by forcing firms to pay higher wages under the treat of strikes
- When wage rates rises faster than labour productivity, inflation may set in due to the rising unit labour cost
- Trade unions can push up wage rates by a larger extent than improvements in labour productivity year after year, there will per repeated supply shocks and a rise in GPL
### Imported inflation
- When there is an increase in the prices of imported inputs which are key inputs to produce a variety of products, cost-push inflation can arise
- Increases in price of crude oil drives up the price of energy, a necessary input in any production process
- This will increase the unit cost of production, causing AS to fall and shift up, increasing the GPL
### Depreciation of exchange rate
- A depreciation of a country's currency results in the increase in the price of imported food, raw materials and capital equipment in terms of local currency
- This leads to a rise in unit cost of production, and decreases in AS, translating into higher prices
### Tax-push inflation
- A rising of broad-based indirect taxes such as GST would lead to a rise in the GPL as it increases the unit cost of production
- Producers, to protect their profit margins, will pass on these taxes to consumers by raising prices, causing an increase in GPL
- The increased cost of living of households may cause workers to ask for higher wages to maintain their current purchasing power
- This leads to further increases in unit cost of production, resulting in more than one round of increases in GPL

## Interaction between demand-pull and cost-push inflation
>[!EXAMPLE]
>Rise in AD/ Fall in AS
>- A rise in AD (due to a rise in export revenue) would cause trade unions to bargain for higher wages as they do not want workers' purchasing power to fall
>- This causes the UCOP to rise, resulting in cost-push inflation
>- There will also be shortages in the labour market as a result of rising AD, strengthening trade union's bargaining power and they may demand further increases in wage rates
>
>![[both demand pull and cost push inflation.png]]
>- Economy is initially in equilibrium with GPL of $P_1$ and output $Y_1$
>- An increase in export revenue would cause AD to rise form $AD_1$ to $AD_2$ and GPL to rise form $P_2$ to $P_3$
>- Expectation of higher inflation in the future would cause a fall in consumer confidence, causing AD to rise from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$, pushing prices up from $P_3$ to $P_4$
>- This causes trade unions to demand even higher wages as the real wage of workers has fallen, causing the unit cost of production to rise even further, resulting in a wage price spiral
>- This is where inflation occurs due to the interlocking process due to increase in cost and increases in aggregate demand
## Effects of inflation (consumers)
- Cost of living is the cost of the basket of goods and services that yield a certain material standard of living
- Cost of living rises as when there is inflation, households have to spend more money to maintain the same level of material living standards
- If a household's nominal income rises more slowly than the GPL, or remains unchanged (e.g. pensioners), there will be a fall in real income and purchasing power
- They consume lesser goods and services, resulting in a lower standard of living
- If a household's nominal income rises more than the GPL would see a rise in their real income, and hence material standards of living
## Effects of inflation (producers)
- If inflation is demand-pull, profit margins increase as prices of goods and services rises faster than unit cost of production
- This is because in the short-run, factor input prices tends to remain unchained because they are fixed by long term contracts
- If inflation is cost-push, firms profit margins decreases, as they cannot fully pass on the increase in unit cost of production to consumers by raising prices
- As they absorb part of the increase in unit cost, this will cause profit margins to decline
## Effects of inflation (economic growth and unemployment)
### Consumption and saving
- If inflation is low and stable, money is still a good store of value, and saving is not discouraged
- If inflation is high and rising, money becomes a poor store of value
- Consumption is encouraged and saving discouraged since the real value of savings is falling rapidly
- With prices rising rapidly, people would want to spend it as quickly as possible before its value falls further
- The increase in spending further fuels inflation
- The fall in spending will lead to lesser funds available for investment
### Investment
- When inflation is low and stable, investment is encouraged, assuming nominal exchange rate remains unchanged, as inflation reduces the real interest rate
- Real inflation rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
- This reduces the real cost of borrowing for investment, encouraging investment
- A low and stable inflation rate provides more certainty for firms when making investment decisions 
- This is because firms can take cures form the price mechanism when there is growing demand for their production
- With more certainty regarding the expected rate or rate on investment projects, firms are more likely to invest
---
- When inflation is high and rising, investment will be discouraged
- High inflation increases the uncertainty of investment decisions, making it difficult for firms to predict costs and revenue as inflation distorts price signals
- Thus, investment is discouraged as the expected rate of returns is volatile
---
- When there is demand-pull inflation, prices of goods and services will rise faster than unit costs, leading to higher profit margins
- This will increase the expected rate of returns on investment, increasing investment
- When there is cost-push inflation, firms may hold back on investment as profitability is lowered
- If cost-push inflation keeps persisting, and the cause is local in origin (e.g. shrinking labour force), domestic firms and foreign firms that have investment may relocate production processes to other countries
- This would lead to a reduction in potential national growth
## Effects of inflation (equity)
### Fixed VS variable income earners
- Fixed income earners (e.g. pensioners) lose during inflation, as their income is fixed in nominal terms and their real income will fall when there is inflation
- Variable income earners may gain during inflation, if their annual nominal wage increases more quickly than the general price level, they would enjoy rising real wages over time
- These workers may belong to trade unions with strong bargaining power
### Savings VS borrowers
- Borrowers gain while savers lose when there is inflation as inflation causes the real interest rate and the real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned to fall
- The nominal interest rate is set when the loan contract is determined
- If inflation is unexpected, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the rise in prices, and the real interest rate is lower than the nominal interest rate
- Real inflation rate = nominal interest rate - inflation rate
- If the inflation rate exceeds the nominal interest rate, the real interest rate will have a negative value
- This means that the real value of the amount received by the lender when the loan matures would be lower than the real value of the debt at the start of the loan period
- Lenders are mainly households who save a portion of their income in banks or use it to buy bonds
- Borrowers include consumers, firms, and the government
- Since borrowers gain while lenders lose, there is an arbitrary redistribution of income amongst households, firms, and government
### Government VS taxpayers
- Assuming a progressive tax structure, inflation causes the government to gain and taxpayers to lose
- When there is inflation, wage-price spiral may eventually set in, where workers demand higher nominal wages to enable them to cope with the rising cost of living
- The rising wages of taxpayers pushes them into higher tax brackets, and they have to pay a larger fraction of their nominal income in taxes, known as bracket creep
- They may do so even tho their real income may not have increased
- Hence, the government gains more tax revenue, and income taxpayers 
## Effects of inflation (efficiency)

### Distortion of the price mechanism
- Prices provide important signals to producers and consumers in their production or consumption decisions
- Inflation distorts the information that flows from price signals
- When there is inflations, it may be difficult for a producer to distinguish whether a change in prices is due to an increase in actual demand or due to inflation
- Should the producer mistake the rise in prices as an increase in demand for their productions, they may allocate more resources to production of the good
- This leads to a misallocation of resources, leading to allocative inefficiency
### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices
- With low inflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and is considered a minor cost
- When there is high inflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly, as they have to change prices to keep up with all other prices in the economy
## Deflation
- ==Deflation is a sustained decrease in the general price level==
## Demand-side deflation
- Demand side deflation is caused by falling AD
>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[demand side deflation.png]]
>- Initially, the economy is at equilibrium national output $Y_1$ and GPL $P_1$ 
>- When AD falls, firms will see a rise in inventories and will decrease production by hiring lesser factors of production
>- The rise in unemployment means that firms are better able to get the resources that they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations and falling unit cost of production 
>- Hence, firms are willing to sell output at lower prices
>- Once there is a fall in the GPL, there will be further increases in AD and hence peristent falls in the GPL
>- This is because once there is a fall in the GPL, consumers expect prices to drop further and will postpone their current spending
>- This causes AD to fall further, and there will be subsequent decreases in GPL and national output
## Causes of demand-side deflation
- AD could be falling due to decreases in consumer spending ($C$), investment spending ($I$), government spending ($G$), and net export revenue ($X-M$)
## Cost-push deflation
- Increases in AS lead to a decrease in GPL and increases in national output

>[!EXAMPLE]
>![[supply side deflation.png]]
>- The economy is initially at equilibrium at GPL $P_1$ and national output $Y_1$
>- AS rises, and firms respond by increasing quantity supplied at each level
>- With excess AS, firms will have to cut prices to stimulate spending so that they can reduce the extra supply
>- Thus the GPL falls to $P_2$ and national output rises to $Y_2$
### Causes of cost-push inflation
- AS could be rising due to decreases in prices of imported inputs, appreciation of the exchange rate, and improvements in technology, which lowers unit cost of production
## Effects of deflation (consumers)
- Assuming no change in household's nominal income, deflation results in a rise in household's real income
- This results in an improvement in material standard of living as consumers are able to purchase more goods and services for consumption due to the fall in prices
---
- In times of demand-side deflation, nominal income remains unchanged only in the short-run (wage contracts) or the household is a fixed income earner
- In the long-run, the household's nominal income will eventually fall (when wage contracts expire and firms lower wage rates)
- The impact of deflation on a household's real income thus depends on the rate of decrease of nominal income and the rate of decrease of GPL
- Deflation also leads to fall in AD as households hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases ion prices
- The fall in national output would would lead to decreases in household's real income and hence decreases in material standards of living
---
- In times of supply-side deflation, when nominal income remains unchanged in the short-run, deflation would lead to a rise in households real income
- In the long-run, nominal income like wages will be rising as firms bid up wage rates to hire more workers, in order to increase output
- This slows down the fall in unit cost of production that was causing the deflation
- But, if GPL is falling and household's nominal income is rising or constant, household's real income will increase, improving material living standards
## Effects of deflation (producers)
- If deflation is due to falling AD, profit margins tend to fall as prices of goods and services will fall faster than unit cost of production
- If deflation is due to rising AS, profit margins will rise as prices of goods and services fall lesser than unit cost of production
- This is because supply of goods and services are not perfectly price elastic, and firms will not fully pass on the lower cost of production
## Effects of deflation (economic growth and unemployment)
### Consumption and saving
- When there is demand-side deflation, households hold back consumption in anticipation of further decreases in prices, causing consumption to fall
- The fall of asset prices (e.g. property) in times of deflation creates a negative wealth effect, and household's wealth falls, lowering consumer confidence and consumption
- The fall in the general price level leads to a rise in the real interest rate
- As the real interest rate is the cost of borrowing, and also the opportunity cost of consumption, a higher interest rate will encourage saving and discourage consumption
### Investment
- With a rise in the real interest rate, firms will be discouraged from investing as the cost of borrowing is higher
- Moreover, if inflation causes consumers to defer consumption, the expected rate of return of investment falls, discouraging investment
- The fall in consumption and investment and hence AD will lead to falls in national output and GPL, and there is negative actual growth
- Unemployment will rise
- The fall in investment will also lower potential growth if the rate of capital deprecation more than the rate of capital accumulation
### Supply-side inflation
- Supply side deflation causes AD to rise (via the wealth, interest rate and international substitution effect), leading to a rise in GDP
- But, supply-side deflation increases the real interest rate, discouraging consumption and investment
- The fall in prices may also cause households to postpone consumption
- But, since national output is rising, consumer and business confidence is buoyant and AD may not fall
- It will depend on the state of the economy; if the economy is poor, then the anticipation of further fall in prices on consumption will prevail, causing AD to fall
## Effects of deflation (equity)
### Fixed VS variable income earners
- Fixed income earners gain during inflation as their incomes are fixed in nominal terms and hence their real income will rise, as inflation increases the real value of money
- Unionised workers with strong bargaining power may gain as with their ability to resist wage cuts, falling GPL would lead to rising real wages
### Creditors VS debtors
- Debtors lose and creditors (lenders) gain as deflation causes the real interest rate and the real value of the amount borrowed/ loaned to rise
- When loans are made interest is charged
- If there is deflation during the loan period, the real value of the debt and interest paid by the debtor will be higher than expected
- The nominal interest rate is set when the loan contract is determined
- If the deflation is unexpected, the nominal interest rate will fail to reflect the fall in prices and the real interest rate will be higher than the nominal interest rate
## Effects of deflation (efficiency)
### Distortion of price mechanism
- Deflation makes it hard for producers to discern whether a fall in price of products is a result of a fall in demand, or a result of deflation
- If the producer mistakes a fall in price of the product due to a fall in demand, and inaccurately devote lesser resources to produce it, there is a misallocation of resources
- There is allocative inefficiency
### Menu costs
- Menu costs are the costs of changing prices
- With low deflation, annual price adjustment is an appropriate business strategy, and is considered a minor cost
- When there is high deflation, firms will see such costs rise rapidly, as they have to change prices to keep up with all other prices in the economy
