- ==Scarcity is where all the resources available for production of goods and services are insufficient to satisfy all human wants==
- This is because resources are limited while human wants are unlimited
- A resource is scarce if the demand when the price is zero exceeds the available supply
## Factors of production
### Land
- Refers to natural resources
- Can be renewable, where they renew themselves at a fast enough pace for sustainable economic extraction, (e.g. water), or non-renewable (e.g. fossil fuels)
- Exchanged for rent
### Labor
- Refers to the physical and mental effort of people
- Exchanged for wages
### Capital
- Refers to all man-made physical assets
- Fixed capital is durable and is used time and time again in the production process (e.g. factory buildings, machinery)
- Circulating capital refers to items such as raw materials, and semi-finished goods and stocks of finished goods waiting to be sold
- Money is not capital, it is only used to invest in capital such as machines
- Exchanged for interest
### Entrepreneurs
- Entrepreneurs undertake the risks of production, organises production, innovates
- They take overall responsibility for the decision making process in the firm (how much to produce, what to produce, how to produce)
## Choice
- Due to scarcity, a choice must be made, which is deciding how to allocate limited resources among competing uses for the satisfaction of human wants
- Consumers have limited income and have to decide on what to buy since they can't buy everything
- Firms can only afford to pay a limited number of resources, and have to decide what to produce and what resources to hire
- Governments have limited budget and have to decide how to allocate its spending
### Opportunity cost
- ==Opportunity cost is the cost of using resources for a certain activity, measured in terms of the net benefit that could be derived form the next best alternative forgone==
## Decision-making process
![[decision making.jpg]]
### Economic agents
- There are three economic agents, consumers, firms, and governments
- Consumers aim to maximise their net total utility (net total utility = total utility - total spending)
- Firms aim to maximise their profits (profits = total revenue - total cost)
- Governments aim to maximise total social welfare (net total social welfare = total social benefits - total social cost)
### Constraints
- Economic agents must be aware of the constraints they are in as this will determine the choices available to them
- Economic agents face budget constraints (e.g. Consumers have limited income; firms have limited financial resources; governments have limited tax revenue)
- Governments also face the social and political acceptability of their chosen method of intervention
### Benefits and costs
- Economic agents use the marginalist principle to make decisions, which involves weighing marginal costs and benefits
- Marginal benefit is the additional benefit of doing one more unit of activity, marginal cost is the additional cost of doing one more activity
- If MB > MC, it is rational to do the activity or more of it, as the addition to total benefit is greater than the addition to total cost
- If MB < MC, it is rational to do lesser of the activity or stop it as the addition to total cost is greater than the addition to total benefit
- Net total benefit is maximised when MB = MC
### Information and perspectives
- Economic agents need to gather accurate information on the costs and benefits of every choice
- Consumers will obtain information that helps them weight private benefit and costs of different goods and services that accrue to them (e.g. the price)
- Firms will obtain information that helps them weigh private benefits and costs through market research to find out tastes of consumers and costs of inputs
- Governments will obtain information that helps them weigh social benefits and costs e.g. benefits that accrue to consumers and third parties, and costs of production and those borne by third parties
- Economic agents do not make decisions in isolation of others, as the impact on and reaction of those affected can affect the outcome of the decision made
### Consequences
- Economic agents make decisions with the expectation that the decision will achieve its intended consequence and hence resolve the economic problem
- Unintended consequences are outcomes that are not intended in the economic decisions
- This can happens when agents do not have perfect information, and conditions in the internal or external environment are subject to constant and unpredictable change
- Economic decision may have to be reviewed and measures to manage any adverse impact may have to be introduced
- Decisions made by economic agents may not just impact the decision maker but can have an impact on other economic agents
- Decisions made on the national level can have an impact on the international level
## PPC
- ==A PPC (production possibilities curve) shows the combinations of the maximum amount of total goods that an economy can produce within a certain period, usually a year, with a fixed level of technology and when all resources are fully and efficiently employed==
- Assumptions
	- Specific period
	- State of technology is unchanges
	- Total available resources remain the same
	- Efficient use of all resources
![[PPC.jpg]]
### Scarcity
- Combinations beyond the PPC are desired due to unlimited wants but unattainable due to limited resources
- Combinations on and inside the PPC are attainable
### Choice
- The economy must decide which attainable combination to produce, thus deciding what and how much to produce
- This depends on society's preferences
### Trade-offs and opportunity cost
- The PPC is downward sloping, thus when one country produces more units of one good, it has the sacrifice some units of the other good
- This is because when the country is on the PPC, it is already fully utilising all available resources and the current technology available
- Producing more consumer goods will incur an opportunity cost of the net benefit foregone from the next best alternative, which is producing more capital goods
### Productive efficiency
- Productive efficiency is the situation in which the economy cannot produce anymore of one good without sacrificing the production of another good
- When a country is on the PPC, it is producing the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
- Thus it must sacrifice one good to obtain more units of another, and it is productive efficient
- If a country is inside the PPC, there is a wastage of resources and it is productive inefficient
- This is due to underemployment (underutilisation of resources) or unemployment (resources are not used at all)
### Shifting
- An outward shift of the PPC indicates an increase in the productive capacity of the economy
- This can be due to an increase in the quantity of resources, or improvement in the quality of resources
### Investment-consumption choice
- Capital goods are goods that are used to produce other goods, and are not meant for consumption
- Consumer goods are goods for final consumption, ready for use as they are
- Investment is the production of capital goods in a certain time period
- The more investment there is (the more capital goods it produces), the greater the productive capacity of the country in the future
- But, the trade-off is that consumer goods are sacrificed now to produce capital goods, and there is an opportunity cost
- Ceteris paribus, the more investment, the greater the rate of economic growth, and the greater expansion in the productive capacity
- This would lead to an outward shift in the PPC
- Capital consumption refers to the reduction in the value of capital goods due to wear and tear and due to capital becoming obsolete
- The productive capacity will increase assuming the the rate of investment is greater than the rate of capital consumption
- If not, the rate of economic growth decreases, and the productive capacity of the economy might decrease, causing the PPC to shift inwards
## Productive efficiency
- Productive efficiency is the situation in which the economy cannot produce anymore of one good without sacrificing the production of another good
- It is producing at the highest possible level of output given its resources and technology
- All firms are producing at the lowest possible average cost; and all resources are employed
### Allocative efficiency
- ==Allocative efficiency is the situation in which the economy is producing the combination of output most desired or wanted by society==
- Society's welfare is maximised
- The economy is producing on the PPC (productive efficient), and the economy is choosing the point which maximises society's welfare according to its preferences
- The last unit provides a marginal benefit to consumers that is equal to its marginal cost of production
- Only one point on the PPC is allocative efficient
## Equity
- Equity is achieved when output is distributed in a way that is considered to be fair or just
- What is fair is based on society's value judgement
- The output may be allocative efficient, but could be unfair or inequitable if some are very rich while some are very poor
- Income inequality, which leads to inequitable output distribution, can lead to social discontent and destroy the economy
