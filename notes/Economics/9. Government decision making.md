## Whether or not to intervene
- A rational government aims to maximise society's welfare, and will only intervene if the benefit of intervention from society's perspective outweighs the cost of intervention
### Benefit
- When correcting market failure, the benefit of intervention is the gain in welfare for society (reduction in welfare loss for society)
- The more significant the market failure (i.e. the greater the welfare loss in a free market), or the more significant in the inequity of distribution of output, the greater the benefit
### Costs
- The government incurs monetary costs (admin costs, monitoring costs, production costs, implementation costs, cost of gathering information on benefits and costs)
- There is also the opportunity cost of intervention
- There is a possible trade-off with another objective
## Deciding between measures
- The government will choose the measure that yields the most benefits at the least costs to society (i.e. greatest net benefit to society)
### Benefit
**Information available**
- For taxes and subsidies, to obtain the socially optimal level of output, the government needs to have adequate information to determine the right level of tax/ subsidy
- For pollution permits, the governments needs adequate information to determine the socially optimal level of pollution is before issuing the correct number of pollution permits
**Price elasticity of demand**
- The extent of change in the quantity demanded due to a price change from a subsidy/ tax depends on the price elasticity of demand for the good/ service
- Taxes and subsidies will be effective in changing the quantity demanded for a good that is price elastic
- If demand for a good is price elastic, a higher tax/ subsidy is needed to bring the market to the socially optimal level of consumption
**Monitoring and enforcement**
- Command measures like regulation are effective if there is adequate monitoring of consumer's/ firm's behaviour and consistent enforcement of the law
**Time taken**
- It takes time for education to change consumer's perception of the true MPB of goods such as cigarettes
- It takes time for consumers to find substitutes when there is a rise in price due to a tax on liquor, and regulation would be faster in changing consumption/ production patterns
- It takes time to equip the structurally unemployed with relevant skills, and unemployment benefits would be faster in helping them maintain a standard of living
### Costs
**Financial**
- Taxes are self-financing, as tax revenue can be used to cover admin costs
- Regulation strains the budget as there must be adequate monitoring, incurring monitoring costs, especially in big countries
**Political**
- Some policies are less popular with the people such as a ban
**Trade-offs**
- A measure to improve allocative efficiency in one market can worsen it in another market
- A measure to improve allocative efficiency can worsen equity, and vice versa
## Perusing a project
- A government would go ahead with a project if the social benefits of the project outweighs the social cost, such that society enjoys a gain in the net total social benefit
- A government will choose the project that yields that highest net total benefit to society
### Social benefits
- Private benefits are benefits that accrue to users and producers of the project
- External benefits are benefits that accrue to third parties who are neither users nor producers of the project
- E.g. building a new highway results fall in commuter's travelling time, and there is also reduced late coming, reduces the loss of man-hours suffered by firms
### Social costs
- Private costs are costs borne by users and producers of the project
- External costs are costs borne by third parties who are neither users nor producers of the project
- E.g. building a highway incurs construction, operating and maintenance costs, and air pollution which results in health problems, causing residents to incur healthcare costs
## Constraints
- Government's have limited financial resources as their main source of revenue is from taxes
- Governments that run budget deficit could finance the deficit by borrowing 
- But, persistent budget deficits would reduce creditor's confidence in its ability to repay tis lawn, and might stop lending
- This harms the government's ability to promote growth due to a lack of accessibility to loans
- Governments must be aware of the constraints they are operating within, as this will determine the choices available to them
## Information and perspectives
- Governments need to gather information on the costs and benefits of every available choice to make sound decisions
- Governments will obtain information that helps when weight total social benefits and costs (benefits and costs borne by consumers and third parties)
- Economic agents do not make decisions in isolation of others, as the impact on and reaction of those affected can affect the outcome of the decision made
## Intended and unintended consequences
- Economic agents make decisions with the expectation that the decision will achieve its intended consequence and hence resolve the economic problem
- Unintended consequences are outcomes that are not intended in the economic decisions
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Banning PMDs would lead to a fall in the number of e-scooter related accidents, injuries and deaths (intended consequence)
>- But, there could be more cycling accidents as delivery riders switch to bicycles (unintended consequnce)
>- If the government tries to mitigate the adverse unintended consequence, this will increase the cost of intervening
>- Governments can realise that economic agents may not be rational to make more appropriate policies
>- They can use loss aversion and fine riders using PMDs
## Government failure
- Government failure occurs when government intervention fails to improve market outcomes, and actually makes them worse
### Conflicting goals between equity and efficiency
- The pursuit of allocative efficiency, by making output reach the level where MSB = MSC might worsen equity
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- School canteen vendors including fruits in food could help reduce welfare loss due to the underconsumption of fruits
>- But, this would raise costs of canteen vendors, who will pass the rise in cost onto consumers through a rise in price
>- This results in inequity if students form lower socio-economic backgrounds are unable to afford the more expensive meals
### Imperfect information
- Governments may have inaccurate information or lack perfect information
- It is difficult to accurately measure the external costs imposed
- The government might overcorrect the market, such as with a tax that is too high, causing a bigger welfare loss
- Bans may also result in a larger in a greater welfare loss if the external cost was not large, compared if the government did not intervene
### Unintended consequences
- Government intervention may cause unintended consequences, adding so much to the costs of the policy such that overall welfare does not improve but worsens 
- A ban on smoking in public would cause more people to smoke at home, causing young children at home to inhale passive smoke, incurring a larger welfare loss
### Time lags
**Lags in data and recognition**
- It takes time for authorities to recognise a problem in the economy
- Economic statistics such as prices are only available with considerable lag
- Many economic indicators are backward looking (they tell what has happened instead of what is happening right now)
- The government may not have information until months after, where the economy may have changed course
**Lags in implementation**
- Due to bureaucracy and red tape in large governments, long periods of time may be needed for policies to be passed
**Lags in impact**
- Policies need time to be implemented and to take effect
- Policies designed to remove on problem may only take effect then the economy is suffering from an opposite problem
### Lack of profit motive
- Nationalisation is when the ownership and control of a firm is transferred from private hand to the state
- The government is not profit-motivated, and are not likely to minimise costs, and there is productive inefficiency
- The lack of competition and profit motive means that nationalised firms are less innovated, and offer limited product choices, which are of poor quality
### Policy myopia
- Governments may look for short-term solutions to solve economic problems to gain political favours, since elected governments are only in office for 5 years
- They would want to use measures that show results in the time frame than a long-term perspective in solving the problems
