## Anti-trust laws
- Governments can apply anti-trust laws to curb anti-competitive practises to prevent excessive market power being held by dominant firms

>[!EXAMPLE]
>- The competition act is enforced by the Competition and Consumer Commission of Singapore
>- It ensures firms play on a level playing field, competing through greater efficiency, lower prices, improved products so that consumers benefit 
>- It prohibits anti-competitive agreements, decisions and practises; abuse of dominant position; mergers and acquisition that lessen competition

### Making price fixing illegal
- Making price fixing (where firms agree to sell their product at a specific price) and predatory pricing illegal, and fining firms caught engaging in such activities
- The fines that firms have to pay disincentivises them as firms risk reducing their supernormal profit if caught
- With reduced market power for the same market, there is more allocative efficiency
- The government can also use loss aversion to increase the effectiveness of the fines
- But, a small fine will not be enough to deter firms form engaging in such behaviour, especially when there is large supernormal profit to be gained
### Breaking up monopolies and disallowing mergers
- Firms are forced to divest, selling off a portion of their assets to increase competition, reducing allocative inefficiency
- But, it might be difficult to prove that firms collude/ engage in anti-competitive actions, especially for tacit collusion
- Rival firms may abuse these laws to retaliate against successful firms who captured a large part of the market because they provide consumers with a better product
- These laws also prevent firms from reaping the benefits of mergers
## Deregulation
- Governments can open up markets by reducing barriers to entry
- This is to increase supply, competition and innovation, to lower prices for consumers
- With a reduction in market power of dominant firms, the market moves to a more efficient and equitable outcome
## Regulate pricing
- Firms with market dominance (oligopolies and monopolies) restrict output and produce lesser than the allocative efficient output where $P=MC$
- Government can then regulate firm's pricing to prevent abuse of market dominance

- Profit maximising output where $MR=MC$ is at $Q_M$, but the allocative efficient output where $P=MC$ is at $Q_{MC}$
- There is welfare loss due to underproduction of $Q_{MC}-Q_M$ units
- For $Q_{MC}-Q_M$ units, the addition to total social cost is lesser than the addition to total social benefit, and there is a gain to society's welfare if $Q_{MC}-Q_M$ units were consumed
- This leads to a welfare loss of area $abe$
- Deregulation is not an option for a natural monopoly as only one firm can prodcue the good/ service profitably
- It is better for it to remain a monopoly so that society can enjoy the cost advantages of large-scale production, as it can supply it at a lower unit cost than two or more firms
### MC pricing
- The government can compel the firm to charge price $P_{mc}$ and output $Q_{mc}$, achieving the socially optimal output
- But, this will cause the firm to make a loss equal to the shaded area as the price $P_{mc}$ is lower than AC
- The government would have the subsidies the monopoly for its loss so that it can make normal profits
- The firm can also charge a fixed initial charge for access to the service such that the fixed charge amount to the shaded area to offset the loss
### AC pricing
- The government can also implement AC pricing, make the natural monopolist charge $P_{AC}$ and produce quantity $Q_{AC}$ such that the firm earns normal profits
- This is not socially optimal, but it is the closest we can get without the government having to grant a subsidy
- But, due to imperfect information, the government does not know the demand and cost curves of the firm, and the firm must supply them with accurate information to regulate it
- The firm can provide inaccurate information so that they can produce less and charge higher prices to make more profit
## Nationalisation
- Governments can also take over a firm and produce a good to achieve allocative efficiency
- The government aims to maximise society's interest rather than profits, it will produce the allocative efficient output and charge the price $P=MC$
- But, the government is not profit-driven and will not minimise costs, leading to significant X-inefficiency
- The government can build and manage the network, and allow private profit-maximising firms to rent the network to supply the goods and services directly to consumers
- There is opportunity cost if the government covers the losses of the natural monopoly
## Subsidies
- Governments can subside the firms to lower firms marginal cost, increasing MC such that it cuts MR at the allocative efficient output level
- But, this lowers the firm's AC and increase the supernormal profits of the firms, leading to a more inequitable income distribution
## Corporate tax
- Governments can tax a firm's supernormal profits, and redistribute them to the poor, improving income distribution 
- But, a reduction in profits reduces the incentive for firms to invest in R&D needed for technological advancement needed for economic growth
