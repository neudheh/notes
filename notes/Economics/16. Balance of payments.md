## Balance of payments
- The balance of payments (BOP) of a country is a statement of all of the international transactions with the rest of the world over a period of time (a year)
## Current account
- The current account includes imports of goods and services, primary income and current transfers (secondary income)
### Payments of goods and services
- Exports of goods and services earn income from overseas, and are inflows of currency into the country
- Imports of goods and services lead to an expenditure, and are outflows of currency from the country
- Balance of trade (BOT) = Export revenue - Import expenditure
### Primary income
- Primary income consists of income flows such as wages, rent, interests and profits flowing into and out of the country
- For example, US MNCs who have invested into Singapore may send their profits back to the US and this is recorded as an outflow from Singapore's current account
- Primary income is the difference between income received by Singapore residents from abroad and income payable to non-residents in foreign countries from Singapore
### Current transfers
- Current transfers include unilateral transfers of money across national boundaries by individuals as gifts, and governments grants and aid to other countries
- E.g. Foreign workers sending a portion of their wages back to their home countries, and government grants and aid to other countries
## Capital and financial account
- The capital and financial account records the international transactions of physical assets (e.g. factories) and financial assets (e.g. stocks)
### Direct investments
- Direct investments include international sales and purchases of fixed assets (e.g. factories)
- Foreign direct investment (FDI), where foreign firms set up operations in the domestic economy, is classified as a long term capital flows
- FDI is affected by long-term factors such as business expectations on revenue and cost, government policies, and political/ social stability
- These long-term capital flows are less liquid (cannot be sold easily or converted into cash without any loss of value)
### Portfolio investment
- Includes financial assets such as stocks, bonds, and other types of financial investment
- Some of these assets like bank deposits and equities are less liquid (can be sold easily or converted into cash without any loss of value), and are short-term capital flows
- Short-term capital flows moving into countries with higher interest rates, or expected appreciation of the exchange rate are known as hot money
## Reserves
- This account records the transactions in the official reserves that are held by a country's central bank
- Many central banks conduct international transactions of currency in order to achieve the desired influence on the exchange rate
- Central banks can hold foreign reserves, which are in foreign currencies, that they can use to buy their home country's currency
- Central banks can also use their home currencies to buy foreign currencies
## BOP equilibrium
- A country's BOP position is determined by the flows of currency in both the current and account and the capital and financial account
- BOP is in equilibrium when the total inflow of currency is equal to the total outflow
- Total currency flow matches the change in a country's reserves
- If inflow of currency exceeds outflow, there is a BOP surplus, and the country is accumulating reserves
- If outflow of currency exceeds inflow, there is a BOP deficit, and the country is drawing from its reserves
## Forex
- Foreign exchange rate is the rate at which one currency can be exchanged for another in the forex market
- The demand for a country's currency is dependant on foreign demand for local goods and services
- The supply of a country's currency is dependent on the country's demand for foreign goods and services
## Floating exchange rate system
- In a floating exchange rate system, the exchange rate is determined by market forces
![[floating exchange rate system.png]]
- The demand curve is downward sloping; at higher exchange rates, Singapore's goods and services are more expensive in terms of Yen, leading to a fall in quantity demanded
- The supply curve is upward sloping; at higher exchange rates, Japan's goods and services are cheaper in terms of SGD to Singaporeans, leading to a rise in quantity supplied
### Changes in demand
![[floating exchange rate system change in demand.png]]
- An increase in demand by the Japanese for Singapore's exports would result in an increase in demand for SGD as the Japanese would need SGD to pay for exports
- The demand curve shifts from $D$ to $D_1$
- At the current exchange rate, there will be a shortage of SGD, causing it to appreciate
- The appreciation will continue until the new equilibrium exchange rate is reached, where $D_1$ intersects $S$, and the shortage is eliminated
### Changes in supply
![[floating exchange rate system changes in supply.png]]
- An increase in demand by Singaporeans for Japanese imports would lead to an increase in supply of the SGD as they will sell their SGD to obtain yen
- The supply curve shifts from $S$ to $S_1$
- At the current exchange rate, there will be a surplus of SGD, causing it to depreciate
- The depreciation rate will continue until the new equilibrium exchange rate is reached,  where $S_1$ intersects $D$, and the surplus is eliminated
## Managed float exchange rate system
- Some countries adopt a managed float exchange rate system, so that they can enjoy some flexibility in managing their exchange rates while not allow for sudden fluctuations
- A large appreciation of the currency will cause exports to be less competitive, while a large depreciation of the currency will cause severe imported inflation
- A managed float exchange rate system is where the exchange rate is allowed to fluctuate according market forces within an undisclosed band
- But if the value of the currency exceeds the upper limit, or falls below the lower limit, the central bank will intervene
- When demand increases, or supply falls, causing the exchange rate to appreciate above the upper limit, the central bank will sell of currency to increase supply
- When supply increases, or demand falls, causing the exchange rate to depreciate below the lower limit, the central bank will buy back currency to increase demand
## Causes of BOT deficit or surplus
- A worsening of the BOT is when the size of the BOT deficit grows, or BOT surplus falls
- An improvement in the BOT is when the BOT deficit decreases or BOT surplus rises
### Changes in domestic price level
- An increase in domestic prices, assuming foreign prices stay the same, causes imports to be relatively cheaper
- Consumers would switch towards imports, causing demand for imports to rise, and import expenditure to increase
- The country's exports will become less price competitive, causing a fall in quantity demanded for exports
- If demand for country's exports is price elastic, t he gain in revenue from the rise in price is lesser than the fall in revenue from the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- The rise in import expenditure and fall in export revenue will cause the BOT to worsen
#### Different rates of inflation
- If a country is facing inflation, while the GPL of its trading partners is relatively stable, it loses price competitiveness, and causes the BOT to worsen
#### Changes in comparative advantage
- Developing countries like China have developed industries which they have comparative advantage in
- The presence of these cheaper substitutes causes developed countries like the US to lose their price competitiveness in the global market for such good
- This led to falling demand for DC's exports for labor-intensive goods, while DC's demand for imports rose
- Developing countries experience rising demand for their exports, and hence an improvement in their BOT
### Changes in exchange rate
- An appreciation of the domestic currency of a country will cause the prices of export in terms of foreign currency to rise
- Foreigners will lower their demand for exports, causing export revenue to fall
- The prices of imports in terms of domestic currency will fall, and the Singaporeans will find imported goods cheaper in terms of SGD
- This will lead them to purchase more imports, and quantity demanded for imports will increase
- If demand for country's exports is price elastic, t he gain in revenue from the rise in price is lesser than the fall in revenue from the more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded
- If demand for imports is price inelastic, expenditure on imports will fall
- But, if the fall in export revenue outweighs the fall in expenditure, the BOT will still worsen
- Assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, an appreciation of a country's currency would lead to a worsening BOT, and a depreciation would lead to an improving BOT
  $$|PED_X + PED_M| > 1$$
### Changes in economic growth rates 
- If a country's key trading partners are in a recession, the fall in foreigners income will lead to a fall in demand for exports as they have lower purchasing power
- This will decrease the economy's exports revenue and worsen the BOT
- If there is a fall in domestic income level due to a recession, domestic consumers will demand lesser imports, causing import expenditure to fall, improving BOT
### Government policies
- If the government carries out policies to boost the country's economic growth, or lower demand deficient employment, there would be a rise in national income
- This would increase local's purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services, including imports
- Import expenditure rises, worsening the BOT
- Governments may also engage in protectionism policies to protect domestic industries from foreign imports, improving the BOT
## Consequences of BOT deficit or surplus
### Consumers
**BOT deficit**
- If the BOT deficit is due to greater levels of consumption of imported consumer goods, in the short-term, consumers will benefit
- This is because there is more variety and a higher level consumption of goods, thus, there is a temporarily higher standard of living
- But, in the long-term, the higher standard of living cannot be sustained, and the BOT deficit would lead to a lower standard of living for future generations
- This is because if spending on imported consumer goods and services is higher than what is earned from exports, the excess spending needs to be paid for by borrowing
- Countries that run BOT deficits are net borrowers
- The future generation has to sacrifice their consumption to pay this past debt, and cut back their consumption of imports so that export revenue can repay the foreign debt
---
- If the BOT deficit was due to from increasing its imports of capital goods, it sacrifices a rise in living standards in the current period 
- The loans could have been used to buy imported consumer goods
- But, this increases the country's capital stock, which will increase its productive capacity, and improve the price competitiveness of its goods/ services
- This will boost the quantity demanded for exports, causing AS to rise
- The rise in AS causes a fall in prices and a rise in equilibrium national output, hence there is economic growth
- The rise in national output means that consumer's material living standards in the long run
- As goods are more price competitive, enabling the country to export more and earn more export revenue
- Thus, the country has the foreign currency to repay the foreign loans it took to import capital goods, and there is no need to cut back on imports in the future
**BOT surplus**
- A BOT surplus means that the country's export revenue is more than its import spending
- The surplus could have been used to finance more imports into the country, and enabling its people to consume more
- Thus, households experience a lower living standard in the short run
- But, a BOT surplus means the country is a net lender as it is lending to its trade partners to buy its exports
- Hence, the country earns the principle sum that it lent and interest payments from aboard, adding to the country's GNI
- This increases people's buying power, and hence material living standards in the long run
### Firms
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening BOT will lead to an increase in the outflow of the currency and a reduced inflow of currency
- The supply of the currency rises relative to its demand, causing the country's currency to depreciate in a floating exchange rate system
- This improves the price competitiveness of domestic firm's products
- This is because domestic products become cheaper in foreign currency terms, and foreign products become more expensive in domestic currency terms
- It also makes imported inputs more expensive in domestic currency terms, raising the cost of production and reducing profits for domestic firms
---
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT will lead to and increase in the inflow of the currency and a reduced outflow of currency
- The supply of currency falls relative to demand, causing the country's currency to appreciate in a floating exchange rate system
- This worsens the price competitiveness of domestic firms products
- This is because domestic products become more expensive in foreign currency terms, and foreign products become cheaper in domestic currency terms
- It also makes imported inputs more cheaper in domestic currency terms, lowering the cost of production and increasing profits for domestic firms
---
- A country under a managed float exchanged system that keeps running a BOT deficit could face pressure on the exchange rate to fall below the lower limit
- This is because import expenditure exceeds export revenue
- To prevent the currency from depreciating, the central bank intervenes by using its foreign reserves to buy back its own currency
- Since the foreign reserves are finite, this invites speculation that the central bank is cannot sustain this intervention, and it may be forced to allow the currency to depreciate
- Fluctuations in currency due to BOT imbalance may be a cause of concern for investors, especially hose who are looking for a long-term presence in the economy (FDI)
- When there are severe currency changes, of the currency changes too quickly, it becomes difficult for firms to make production and investment decision
### Economic growth and full employment
**Worsening BOT**
- A worsening BOT would mean a fall in (X-M), resulting in a fall in AD, and there may be a multiplied fall in equilibrium national income, and a rise in unemployment
- In a floating exchange rate system, a worsening BOT may lead to a depreciation of the exchange rate, causing BOT to improve
- This helps to reduce the contractionary impact on national output, and the overall fall in AD may not be that much
- In a managed float exchange rate system, a worsening BOT could cause the foreign exchange rate to fall below the intervention band
- The central bank will buy back the local currency, causing domestic money supply to fall, and causing AD to fall via a fall in C and I
- This causes further contraction of national output
**Persistently large BOT deficit**
- A BOT deficit is finance by borrowing from trade partners
- A persistently large BOT deficit might cause foreign lender to lose confidence in the country's ability to repay its loans
- This is likely when the country's BOT deficit arose mainly form the import of consumer goods/ service
- Foreign lenders will cut off on all new loans, and ask for full repayments on any loans for which the principal can be demanded on short notice
- The country will have to cut back on imports, including capital goods, slowing down economic growth
---
- A larger persistent and rising BOT deficit can cause foreigners to lose confidence in the stability of the the country's foreign exchange rate
- If the country is on a floating exchange rate system, a rising BOT deficit will lead to a continued depreciation of the foreign exchange rate
- This will lower's foreign expected rate of return of investments in the country, causing them to sell off their assets
- A country under a managed float exchanged system could face pressure on the exchange rate to fall below the lower limit
- To prevent the currency from depreciating, the central bank intervenes by using its foreign reserves to buy back its own currency
- Since the foreign reserves are finite, this invites speculation that the central bank is cannot sustain this intervention
- Foreigners will call back their loans, sell their assets they own and move their funds out of the country (capital flight)
- This puts additional pressure on the exchange rate, and the central bank may be forced to allow the currency to depreciate
- With a depreciating exchange rate, firms cannot pay back their foreign loans, and are forced to close down
- Unemployment results, and there is a recession as investment is falling
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT will result in a rise in AD and a rise in equilibrium national income, output and employment if the economy is below full employment
- In a floating exchange rate system, an improving BOT would lead to an appreciation of the currency, which will worsen the BOT and dampen the rise in national output
- In a managed float exchange rate system, an improving BOT could cause the foreign exchange rate to rise beyond the intervention band
- The central bank will intervene by selling the domestic currency to prevent the appreciation
- This will increase the supply of the currency in the forex market and increase the foreign reserves
- Once the foreigners spend the domestic currency on the country's goods and services, the local currency ends up in bank accounts of exporters
- Hence, the money supply to rise and this will cause AD and national income to rise, if there is excess capacity
**Persistent BOT surplus**
- If the country is experiencing a persistent BOT surplus, its trading partners are experiencing BOT deficits
- They may retaliate and impose protectionism measures, resulting in a fall in net exports of the country experiencing a BOT surplus, reducing output and employment
### General price stability
**Worsening BOT**
- If economy was initially overheated with high demand-pull inflation, a worsening BOT helps to ease this pressure as the fall in $(X-M)$ causes a fall in AD
- But, if the worsening BOT results in the depreciation of the exchange rate, it will cause the price of imported inputs to rise, resulting in imported inflation
**Improving BOT**
- An improving BOT would result a rise in AD, bringing about demand pull inflation if the economy is operating near full employment
- But, if the improving BOT results in the appreciation of the exchange rate, it would cause imported inputs to become cheaper, reducing imported inflation
