## Production tax
- A tax on good and services is called an indirect tax
- Firms have the legal responsibility to pay such taxes to the government, but some of the tax may be be passed onto consumers through higher prices
- This can discourage consumption/ production of a particular good
![[Production tax.jpeg]]
- The government can impose a per unit output tax equal to the MEC at the socially optimal output $Q^*$, forcing firms to internalise the external costs
- The output tax raises producer's MPC, causing supply to fall
- The supply curve (MPC) will shift vertically upwards to SS' by the amount of the MEC at $Q^*$
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEC accurately, the tax results in a fall in market equilibrium output from $Q$ to $Q^*$
- This is because the fall in supply in the indirect tax would lead to a shortage, putting upward pressure on prices
- As the price of the good rises, this disincentives consumption, and quantity demanded falls until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied at $Q^*$
- The equilibrium output, where SS'=DD, coincides with socially optimal output $Q^*$, where MSB = MSC, and welfare loss of area $D$ is eliminated
## Pollution tax
- A pollution tax is a compulsory levy imposed on producers, where firms have to pay the government a fixed fee per unit of pollution generated
- It creates incentive for firms to reduce pollutants/ emissions
![[Pollution tax.jpeg]]
- Rational firms will choose to lower pollution if the MPB of lowering pollution (not paying the tax), outweighs the marginal private cost (installing equipment to reduce emissions)
- This causes MPC to rise from $MPC$ to $MPC'$
- With a reduction in pollution, the impact on third parties is reduced from $MEC$ to $MEC'$
- This would cause deadweight loss to fall from area $D$ to area $C$, resulting in a more allocative efficient outcome
- If firms choose to pay the tax, their cost of production will rise, and supply will fall
- This will lower the level of pollution in society and result in a more allocative efficient outcome
## Subsidies
- A subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, not in exchange for any goods or services
- This can help to encourage overall consumption/ production of a particular good, or make a good more affordable for the poor
![[subsidy.jpeg]]
- The government can pay firms a per unit output subsidy equal to MEB at socially optimal level of output $Q^*$
- This will lower the firm's MPC, increasing supply
- The SS curve (MPC) will shift vertically downwards to $SS'$ by the amount of MEB at $Q^*$, leading to a fall in the price of the good/ service
- The lower price will incentivise consumers to increase consumption towards the socially optimal level $Q^*$, therefore internalising the MEB to society
- Assuming the government has perfect information and is able to estimate the MEB accurately, the subsidy results in a rise in output from $Q$ to $Q*$
- The equilibrium output, where SS'=DD, coincides with socially optimal output $Q^*$, where MSB = MSC, and welfare loss of area $A$ is eliminated
- Subsidies are flexible as government can vary the per unit subsidy according to the MEB, enabling the socially optimal output level to be attained
### To address factor immobility
- The government can also subsidise the provision of training by firms to encourage workers whose skillsets have become obsolete to upgrade their skills
- The price of training courses will fall, leading to an increase in quantity demanded
- As workers are equipped with the latest skills, they can move easily into industries that are in demand, reducing occupational immobility
## Tradable permits
- Tradable permits are permits to pollute issued to firms by a government, which can be traded and sold in market
- The government first decides on the optimal level of pollution that is allowable
- Once the government calculates the total allowable pollution, they can auction the corresponding number of permits to pollute to firms, or give them to firms for free
- Firms are then free to buy and sell the permits with each other, and the prices of permits are determined by determined by demand and supply forces
- Firms that get the permits gain the right to emit the given quantity of pollution
- Firms with high clean-up costs would wish to pollute above the quota of they were initially allocated
- They can buy permits from firms with low clean-up costs, who pollute lesser than the quota assigned to them, so that they can sell their permit and earn profit
- Thus, some firms are incentivised to find cleaner methods of production to reduce their pollution
- Rational firms will choose to lower pollution if the MPB of lowering pollution (price of the permit), outweighs the marginal private cost (installing equipment to reduce emissions)
- The overall pollution level is reduced tot he total allowable pollution that the government set
- Tradable permits provide incentives to switch to cleaner methods of production, targeting the root cause of the problem
- They allow for certainty of outcome in terms of the overall total pollution level, as the government decides on the total allowable pollution and how many permits to issue
## Grants/ vouchers
- The government can give grants (lump sum payment for a specific purpose), or vouchers with expiry 
- These help to increase consumers/ producers consumption/ production of a good
- These increase the consumer's purchasing power, increasing their demand consumption of the good or service to the socially optimal quantity
- Grants to producers increase their ability to produce more of the good or service to improve allocative efficiency
## Direct provision
- Direct provision is when the government supplies the good directly to consumers, taking on the role of the producer
### Free direct provision
- There is market failure for public goods as there is a lack of effective demand, and any profit-motivated producer will not produce it, resulting in a missing market
- The government is not profit-oriented, and does not need to earn revenue to cover the cost of production
- The direct provision of the goods and services can be financed through taxes the government collects, and the public goods are provided free of charge
- This helps to achieve allocative efficiency
- But, the funds used to produce the good could have been spend on other areas, and there is an opportunity cost
- Imperfect information can cause the government to over or under produce the good
- Governments are productive inefficient as a government owned firm's target is largely to meet output levels set by the government, and lack the incentive to minimise cost
- Governments can fund and outsource the production and maintenance of the good to private producers by giving them contracts
- They are more efficient in minimising costs than the public sectors as the cost has a direct effect on their profitability
### Direct provision
![[free direct provision.jpeg]]
- The market output when then price is zero is $Q_f$, and the welfare loss of area $CDE$ is incurred
- $Q_f$ is closer to the socially optimal level of output, and a smaller welfare loss is incurred
- However, there is also the possibility of creating greater welfare loss due to overconsumption, in cases where the MEB is not that large
- The government can instead directly provide the good and charge a low positive price 
- The government can use joint provision, where the private and public sectors produce a good together
- The private sector creates competition for the government firm and improves productive efficiency
## Ban
- A total ban, where zero quantity of the good is allowed to be consumed/ produced can be imposed 
![[total ban.jpeg]]
- The socially optimal level of output is $Q^*$ where MSB = MSC, and the net total social benefit is given by area $A$
- The market equilibrium output is $Q$, where DD = SS, and a deadweight loss of area $B$ is incurred
- If the government imposes a ban, output will drop to 0
- Society will no longer incur the welfare loss of area B, but it will also lose the net total social benefit of area $A$ from consuming $Q^*$
- If the MEC was large such that the divergence between MPC and MSC is large, area $B$ > area $A$, and society's welfare is improved
- But, if area $A$ > area $B$, it will be better to leave the market alone and let it produce at $Q$
## Quota 
- A quota is a measured by which the government regulates the quantity of a good that can be offered for sale
![[quota.jpeg]]
- The market equilibrium price is at $P_1$ and equilibrium quantity is at $Q_1$
- The government imposes a quota, fixing the quantity of goods that can be sold to $Q_2$, and the new supply curve is given by the bold line
- This results in the new equilibrium price of $P_2$
## Lemon law
- To manage adverse selection, there is a need to put in place structures to allow for a free flow of information
- The government can enact laws such as the lemon law, which forces sellers to replace or repair defective goods
- If the repairs or replacements are not possible or provided within a reasonable time, buyers are allowed the right to a discount or refund
- As there is now an avenue for buyers to punish the seller, sellers are force to be honest about the product quality
- Hence, buyers would be more willing to pay higher prices for good quality products since they have greater assurance of product quality
- This reduces the problem of adverse selection s buyers and seller of good quality products can engage in mutually advantageous trade
## Public education
- This addresses the problem of imperfect information by providing information on the true marginal benefits
![[public education.jpeg]]
- With public education, consumers are aware of the true MPB of being vaccinated, hence they are more willing to be vaccinated
- This causes demand for vaccination to increase to the true MPB curve
- The new market equilibrium quantity matches the socially optimal quantity to be consumed, $Q^*$, resolving allocative inefficiency
