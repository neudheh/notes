## Benefits of free trade
### Increased welfare from higher levels of consumption
- The theory of comparative advantage states that mutually beneficial trade between countries is possible when a country has comparative advantage in producing an item over another country
- Having a comparative advantage means that a country can produce a good at a lower opportunity cost
- By specialising in the product is has comparative advantage in and trading with each other, countries can enjoy higher levels of consumption
- Each country can get more of the other good by trading rather than domestic production
- Hence, more wants are satisfied and society's welfare is increased
### Increase in welfare from greater variety
- Horizontal intra-industry trade enable countries to enjoy a greater variety of goods from the same industry, enabling more wants to be satisfied
- Thailand has comparative advantage in mangoes, but if consumers want strawberries, it could cultivate them but incur very high opportunity cost, making it unlikely to do so
- Trade enables it to import strawberries from temperate countries at low prices and at the same time, there is a widening of consumer choice
- Consumer goods from the same manufacturing category can be differentiated
- If a manufacturer were to cater to the varied tastes of consumers for the same product, it would not be able to enjoy EOS, and would limit the number of models of its product
- But trade allows consumers from different countries to buy each other's manufactured products form the same category, increasing variety
### Increase in welfare from lower domestic prices due to EOS
- International trade results in lower unit costs hence prices because a larger world market enables a larger scale of production, both at the firm level and industry level
- An exporting firm may experience internal EOS as it increases its output
- External EOS can be reaped when expansion of the industry's output due to trade results in the improvement of transportation, financial and training facilities for the entire industry
- This is important for small countries (e.g. Singapore) who face a small domestic market for significant EOS to be reaped
- If firms produce only for the Singapore market, unit costs would be high as the size of the domestic market would cause the scale of production to be too low to reap significant EOS
### Increased welfare form lower price and better quality due to increased competition
- International trade increases competition and promotes efficiency among local producers as they are forced to innovate, cut costs and improve the quality of products
- Monopoly power may be reduced
- With the influx of imports, firms have to more efficient to survive against competition from foreign firms
- Local monopolies/ oligopolies are also forced to compete with foreign produces resulting in lower prices, higher output and more variety of goods for consumers
### Actual growth
- If export revenue rises more than import expenditure, the rise in AD will lead to a rise in equilibrium national output, assuming spare capacity
- A developing country may lack sufficient domestic demand for certain natural resources that are relatively plentiful in local supply, resulting to in underemployment of resources
- International trade can be a vent for surplus for developing countries, allowing them to overcome their domestic demand constraints
- This can lead to actual growth as countries export these resources or goods made using these resources
- Thus, trade enables fuller utilisation of unemployed or underemployed resources, increasing output, income, and employment in the country
### Potential growth
- Countries that engage in international trade can gain access to modern technology
- Developing countries can import more technologically advanced to capital equipment from developed countries to produce goods and service domestically
- This can lead to higher productivity through improvements in the quality of capital, promoting potential growth
### Structural change
- When the country opens to itself to trade, accompanying the development of merchandise trade would be the development of complementary services like shipping, banking and finance, and tourism
- With time, a developing economy will experience structural change which involves being less dependent on the secondary sector (merchandise trade and manufactural)
- It will be able to expand into its tertiary sector by diversifying into the production of services
- Such structural changes lead to the production of higher-value goods and services, furthering the goals of economic growth and improvements in the standard of living
## Costs of free trade
### Structural unemployment
- According the the theory of comparative advantage, a country that opens to trade is supposed to benefit from higher levels of consumption with full employment maintained
- With the assumption of perfect mobility, resources will be channeled from less efficient industries (comparative advantage) to the more efficient one (comparative disadvantage)
- But, most resources (e.g. labour) are immobile
- For labour to be transferred from one industry to another, extensive retraining is needed, which can be costly and takes time
- Older workers are also reluctant to be retrained, and employers are reluctant to spend on their training
- Thus, free trade can lead to structural unemployment to countries with comparative advantage
### Increased inequality
- With factor immobility within a country, opening up to international trade can lead to rising and persistent income inequality
- Those employed in exporting sectors may enjoy rising income, while those in competing sectors face falling income or lose their jobs
- When developed countries such as the US, with their comparative advantage in goods that use capital and skilled labour, capital owners and skilled workers will earn more
- This is because the export of capital and skilled intensive goods will drive up the derived demand for capital and skilled labour
- The import of low-skilled and labour-intensive products resulting in a fall in demand for such goods, reducing wage rates for low-skilled workers in such countries
- Thus, income distribution becomes more unequal
### Macro instability
- Countries that are dependent on external demand for growth are vulnerable to external shocks
- A country that is overtly dependent on exports will face adverse effects on its GDP if external demand falls due to recession in other country
- The growth of the exporting country will slow down or become negative, resulting in demand-deficient unemployment
- War or natural disasters would cause movements in and out of the country to become hindered
- A country that depends on others for weapons, ammunition, oil, food and other raw materials can experience severe hardship or economic set-back in such circumstances
- Globalisation has resulted in open and import-reliant economic like Singapore to be more susceptible to imported inflation
- Extreme weather and rising demand have caused food prices to spike
- Globalisation has also lead to increases in demand for crude oil
- Global conflicts such as the Russia-Ukraine war has also led to disruptions in the supply chain, resulting in rising imported inflation in Singapore
### Unfair competition
- Dumping is when foreign produces sell at prices below their marginal cost of production by making losses so that prices of imports will be lower than that of domestic products
- Firms are able to sell below marginal costs overseas because of government assistance in the form of subsidies
- This is to try to force to force the domestic out in order to gain monopoly power
- Once monopoly power is established, foreign firms will then charge high monopoly prices to reap supernormal profits
- Although consumers may enjoy lower prices in the short run, they will suffer from higher prices and lower output in the long run
## Benefits of free flow of capital
### Long term capital flows
- For developing countries that have liberalised their capital markets and have substantial inflow of FDI, there will be an increase in GDP via AD
- This results in actual glow and has enabled employment of workers
- Through FDI, MNCs also bring resources, technology, training, which increase the productive capacity of the country, generating potential growth
- FDI also provides access to overseas markets for the country that hosts FDI, as firms offshore to developing country to produce more cheaply for the global market
- This boosts export revenue, further increasing AD, generating actual growth and jobs for the country that hosts the FDI
### Short term capital flows
- International capital inflows augment the domestic saving level, increasing the supply of loanable funds, lowering the interest rate
- This raises investment, leading to an increase in AD, generating actual growth and creating jobs via the multiplier effect
## Costs of free flow of capital
### Forex
- Short term capital flows are volatile
- When a country has a managed float exchange rate system, if it persistently has a BOP deficit, the central bank will buy back currency to increase demand
- This is to support the exchange rate and prevent it from depreciating beyond the lower limit of the bed
- But, the central bank has to draw from its reserves to do so
- Since the foreign reserves are finite, this invites speculation that the central bank is cannot sustain this intervention
- Foreigners will call back their loans, sell their assets they own and move their funds out of the country (capital flight)
- This puts additional pressure on the exchange rate, and the central bank may be forced to allow the currency to depreciate
- This can cause investors to lose confidence in the currency, and the erosion of confidence in regional economies can paint a poor economic outlook for trading partners
- Banks will curb their lending activities, causing consumption and investment, hence AD to fall, resulting in negative growth and unemployment
### Employment
- Developed countries relocate or off-shore, shifting parts of production overseas where wage rates are lower to sty afloat amidst global competition and the inflow of capital
- This has lead to a steady loss/ decline of the manufacturing base in developed countries
- This has resulted in the loss of jobs among the lower income group and the middle class in developed countries
- As those in the lower-income group have lesser education and fewer opportunities for retraining, this will lead to further mismatch of skills between what those employed have and what is required by employers
- This makes it harder for these workers to find jobs in sunrise industries, leading structural unemployment
- The increased competition brought on by globalisation has motivated firms to adopt improved technology to lower unit costs of production
- This will lead to structural unemployment as workers lacking the skills to work with new technology will be retrenched
- These workers are unable to find jobs in other sectors due to mismatch of skills
## Benefits of free flow of labour
- In developed countries, migrant labour has eased labour shortages in many sectors
- This helps to lower unit costs of production, increasing AS and causing horizontal AS to shift downwards
- This promotes actual growth and keeps cost-push inflation at bay
- The inflow of foreign labour also helps to counter the slowing down in growth due to an shrinking and aging labour force in developed countries
- They help to increase the size of the labour force due to its huge influx of skilled and semi-skilled foreign labour
- There can be a brain gain for the country, improving the quality of labour of the country, leading to potential growth
- This is also true when migrant workers return to their home country with new skillsets, enabling the productive capacity to rise, generating potential growth
## Costs of free flow of labour
- For developing countries, the immigration of highly qualified professionals to developed countries (brain drain) adversely affects potential growth
- Their countries of origin will suffer a shortage of skilled growth, causing the quantity and quality of labour fall, affecting productive capacity and potential growth
- But, when they return, the new migrants bring back foreign knowledge and experience and transfer these foreign technologies, increasing productive capacity
## Overall analysis
- With globalisation, the wage rates of skilled labour and professionals in developed countries will be rising as the sectors that need such labour will be expanding
- This is because the country has comparative advantage in high-tech, high-skilled production
- Industries that have comparative disadvantage will be declining
- Workers in developed countries that perform services which are increasingly outsourced or offshored also see falling demand for the labour services will see falling wage rates
- In developed countries, the wages of low and middle income households have been falling or stagnating
- Whereas the income of shareholders of MNCs, from high income households, have enjoyed rising profits
- This is because globalisation allows firms to expand production substantially by exporting to more countries, or cut costs by offshoring
---
- In developing countries, there is a rising demand for goods of their comparative advantage (low-skilled labour-intensive products)
- This drives up demand for low-skilled workers and bring about a rise in wages for low skilled workers, which are in abundance
- Capital owners face falling demand for their goods (capital-intensive goods) as it has comparative disadvantage, hence face lower returns
- But there has been rising income inequality between capital and labour owners, and higher skilled and lower skilled workers
- MNCs bring with them technology that is advanced, resulting in rising demand for skilled-labour and more capital-intensive methods of production
- This drives up the demand for capital, and the income of capital owners will rise
### Greenhouse gas emissions
- Globalisation has increased the demand for transactional road, sea, and air transport, which are major emitters of greenhouse gasses
- Increased global competition from trade has encouraged firms in developed countries to move production to developing countries where the unit cost of production is lower
- This is due to more lenient environment laws, allowing them to emit more greenhouse gasses
- Globalisation has encouraged deforestation, which contributed to global warming
- Globalisation has enabled developing countries to export agricultural products, which helps them to achieve actual growth
- But, it also clears forest for farm land, contributing to global warming, causing water shortages, and natural disasters
### Impoverishing biodiversity
- Globalisation has been linked the extinction of some animal and plant species
- The growth brought about by globalisation has been accompanied by increased urbanisation, farming and mining
- E.g. clearing forests to make way for plant oil plantations
- The destruction of biodiversity have economic costs
- E.g. when water becomes polluted, countries will need to water purification, and sickness from pollution leads to increased spending on healthcare
