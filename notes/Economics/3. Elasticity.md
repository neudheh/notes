## Income elasticity of demand (YED)
- ==Income elasticity of demand (YED) is the responsiveness of demand to a change in income, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in income

| Value       | Type               | Explanation                                                                                |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| YED < 0     | Inferior           | Increase in income would lead to a fall in demand                                          |
| 0 < YED < 1 | Normal (Necessity) | Increase in income would lead a less than proportionate rise in demand (income inelastic)  |
| YED > 1     | Normal (Luxury)    | Increase in income would lead to a more than proportionate rise in demand (income elastic) |
- The larger the YED, the larger the shift in demand given a rise in income
## Factors affecting YED
### Degree of necessity
- Necessities have a low YED (as people's income change, demand for necessities changes less than proportionately)
- We have a limited need to consume more/ less of necessities as our income changes, especially if we have been consuming sufficient quantities already
- Luxuries have a high YED (as people's income change, demand for luxuries rises more than proportionately)
- The rise in income will give consumers to confidence to buy items such as sport cars, and the demand will rise more than proportionately
- When incomes fall, households will cut back on these items and demand will fall more than proportionately
### Changing perception of the good due to income level
- A good can be considered a normal good at low income levels but regarded as inferior at higher income levels
- When income rises from a low level, demand for public transport rises as it is a normal good
- People still buy it as they cannot afford a more desirable substitute such as cars
- At higher income levels, they may afford cars, and demand for public transport will fall as people switch to the more desirable substitute
- Public transport is now viewed as an inferior good
## Cross-price elasticity of demand (XED)
- ==Cross-price elasticity of demand (XED) measures the responsiveness of demand for a good to a change in price of another good, ceteris paribus==
- It is the percentage change in demand for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of another good

| Value   | Relationship  | Explanation                                                                                                   |
| ------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| XED < 0 | Complementary | If the price of good B rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, and demand for good A (complement) will fall |
| XED > 0 | Subsitutes    | If the price of good B rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, and demand for good A (substitute) will rise |
| XED = 0 | Independent   | If the price of good B rises, quantity demanded of good B falls, but the demand for good A is unchanged       |
- If the magnitude of the XED is large, they are close substitutes/ complements
## Factors affecting XED
### Closeness of substitutes/ complements
- The closer the relationship between the two goods, the larger will be the effect on the demand for the good given a change in the price of the related good
- Large positive XED indicates close substitutes; large negative XED indicates close complements
- Close substitutes must be in the same price range
## Price elasticity of demand (PED)
- ==Price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of quantity demanded for the good due to a change in price==
- It is the percentage change in quantity demanded for a good resulting from a percentage change in price of the good, ceteris paribus
- PED is negative because of the inverse relationship between price and quantity demanded

| Value                                    | Explanation                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Perfectly price inelastic (PED = 0)      | For a given rise in price, the quantity demanded for the good remains the same                                            |
| Price inelastic (0 < PED < 1)            | A rise in price brings about a less then proportionate fall in quantity demanded                                          |
| Price elastic (PED > 1)                  | A rise in price brings about a more than proportionate fall in quantity demanded                                          |
| Perfectly price elastic (PED = $\infty$) | At the given price, quantity demanded is infinitely large, but an rise in price will cause quantity demanded to drop to - |

- It is not the gradient
## Factors affecting PED
### Number and closeness of substitutes
#### Number
- An increase in the price of a good can cause its substitutes to become relatively cheaper
- If there are numerous substitutes, a percentage increase in price leads to a larger fall in quantity demanded because consumers can easily switch to other substitutes
#### Closeness
- If the good is narrowly defined (e.g. iPhone), demand will be price elastic as there are many close substitutes available
- If the good is broadly defined (e.g. smartphones), demand will be price inelastic as there are not many close substitutes available
- Close substitutes must be in the same price range
- Advertising reduces the price elasticity of demand for the good as it creates greater brand loyalty, and consumers view competitors as poor substitutes
### Proportion of income spent on the good
- The larger the proportion of the consumers' income the good takes up, the greater the price elasticity of the demand
- When the price of such goods rises, consumer's ability to afford them is lowered more significantly, and quantity demanded for these goods will fall more than proportionately
### Degree of necessity
- The more necessary a good or service its, the lower its price elasticity of demand
### Habit-forming nature of good
- When a product is habit-forming (e.g. alcohol), other goods become poor substitutes
### Time period
- Demand will be price elastic ind the long run
- Time is needed for consumers to find suitable substitutes after a price change and alter their expenditure patterns
- Imperfect knowledge about price changes in the short run, as consumers do not have perfect and instantaneous knowledge of all market prices at all times
- However, as time passes, more consumers will respond to the change in price of the good by reallocating their expenditure to the relatively cheaper good
## Total revenue/ expenditure
- Total expenditure by households is equal to the total revenue received by firms
- Price does not change on its own, it is through a shift in demand that causes a change in price
### Price elastic
![[TRTE for price elastic demand.jpeg]]
- If price falls from a to c, 
- The loss in revenue from the fall in price (area abcd) is lesser than the gain in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded (area def)
- Thus, there is a increase in total revenue
### Price inelastic
![[TRTE for price inelastic demand.jpeg]]
- If price falls t to v,
- The fall in revenue due to the fall in price (area tuwv) is greater than the gain in revenue due to the less than proportionate rise in price (area wxzy)
- Thus, there is a fall in total revenue
## Price elasticity of supply (PES)
- Price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of quantity supplied to a change in price, ceteris paribus

| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| Price elastic supply (PES > 1)                  | A rise in price will bring about a more than proportionate rise in quantity supplied | ![[PES more than 1.jpeg]]                  |
| Price inelastic supply (PES < 1)                | A rise in price will being about a less than proportionate in quantity supplied      | ![[PES more than 0 but lesser than1.jpeg]] |
| Perfectly price inelastic supply (PES = 0)      | A fixed quantity that the producer can sell regardless of the price                  | ![[PES = 0.jpeg]]                          |
| Perfectly price elastic supply (PES = $\infty$) | Producers are able to sell any quantity they want at the given price                 | ![[PES = INF.jpeg]]                        |
## Factors affecting PES
### Time period
- In the very short run, all factors of production cannot be varied, and quantity supplies is unable to respond to ca change in price 
- Supply is perfectly price elastic
- In the short run, when price rises, there is at least one fixed factor of production, and firms can only adjust by using more of the variable factors to increase production 
- Supply is price inelastic
- In the long run, all factors of production are variable, as existing firms can increase all factors of production, and new firms can enter the industry as it is more profitable 
- Supply is price elastic
### Behaviour of marginal costs
- Supply is more price elastic if firms have more spare capacity to increase production without a huge rise in marginal costs
- Firms will be able to respond to a rise in price of a good by producing a more than proportionate amount if they have existing resources that are easily affordable and available
- Supply is more price elastic if firms can switch away from producing alternative products easily 
- I.e. factors of production are mobile, and can be easily transferred from the production of one good to another without a rise in marginal costs
### Definition of the good
- Price elasticity of supply is greater for more narrowly defined goods
- E.g. Nike shoes are price elastic as Nike can obtain factors of production from other firms, compared to the shoe industry getting factors of production from other industries
## Answering questions
### Extent of change in price (single shift)
- If both demand and supply are price inelastic, it will take a large increase in price to eliminate a shortage
- A rise in price leads to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded and a less than proportionate fall in quantity supplied
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- When supply falls, it creates a shortage at the existing price
>- Agricultural products are price inelastic as they are very few close substitutes, and consumers have very few alternatives to switch to
>- A rise in price would cause quantity demanded to fall less than proportionately
>- Supply is price inelastic since the factors of production cannot be increased easily (e.g. land to grow wheat)
>- A rise in price would cause quantity supplied to fall rise than proportionately 
>- A shift in supply would cause price to change by a large extent
### Extent of change in quantity and price (simultaneous shift)
- The change in price and quantity depends on the direction of the change and the relative magnitude of the change in demand
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Market for agricultural produce is initially at price $P_1$ and quantity $Q_1$
>- A fall in consumer's income would lead to a fall in their purchasing power, and they can consume lesser goods and services, causing demand to fall from $D_1$ to $D_2$
>- As agriculture is a normal necessity, 0 < YED < 1
>- Floods have caused production shocks, leading to a fall in producer's ability to supply agricultural produce, causing supply from $S_1$ to $S_2$
>- The fall in supply is likely to be larger than the fall in demand as the floods would have reduced supply significantly
>- The fall in demand is small as it is income inelastic
>---
>- The larger fall in supply relative to demand would cause a shortage at the existing price, and there is upward pressure on price
>- Agricultural products are price inelastic, due to there being few close substitutes
>- Supply is price inelastic too as the factors of production cannot be increased easily (e.g. land to grow wheat)
>- Since demand and supply are both price inelasitc, a large rise in price is needed to eliminate the shortage
>- This is since a rise in price would lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded and a less than proportionate rise in quantity supplied
>- Price increases from $P_1$ to $P_2$, and quantity falls from $Q_1$ to $Q_2$
### Changes in total revenue/ expenditure
- We need to analyse the changes in supply in demand on total revenue step-by-step
>[!EXAMPLE]
>- Holding demand constant, the fall in supply from $S_1$ to $S_2$ would lead to a rise in price from $P_1$ to $P'$
>- As demand is price inelastic, the gain in revenue from the rise in price would be greater than the fall in revenue from the less than proportionate fall in demand
>- Total revenue increases from $0P_1E_1Q_1$ to $OP'E'Q'$
>---
>- Holding supply constant at $S_2$, a fall in demand would lead to a fall in total revenue as both price and quantity decreases as demand fall
>- Total revenue falls from $0'P'E'Q'$ to $0P_2E_2Q_2$
>---
>- The fall in supply is likely to be larger than the fall in demand as the floods would have reduced supply significantly
>- The fall in demand is small as it is income inelastic
>- Thus the increase in total revenue from the fall in supply would outweigh the fall in total revenue from the fall in demand
>- There is an overall ris ein revenue form $O_1E_1Q_1$ to $0P_2E_2Q_2$
