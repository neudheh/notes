## Price mechanism
### Signalling and incentive role of prices
- The signalling role of prices helps the economy decide what an how much to produce
- Consumers sovereignty means that consumers determine what goods and services are produce
- Consumers vote for what they want through their purchases, and vote against a product by not buying it
- Firms will only devote scarce resources to produce a goods or service only if it is profitable
- How much of a good is produced is determined by the price mechanism by finding the price at which quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
- Changes in price signal to producers if more/ less resources should be allocated to the production of a good

- If consumers increase the demand for cars, the demand curve will rise from $D$ to $D'$ and there will be a shortage of $Q_2-Q_e$ units at the initial price
- This puts upward pressure on prices, incentivising firms to increase quantity supplied because they can earn profits
- The higher price means firms are receiving more to cover their marginal cost of production
- The rise in profitability thus incentivises firms to increase production in response to the change in preferences of consumer
- Firms will hire more factors of production and more resources are channeled into the industry and more of the good will be produced, increasing quantity supplied
- The rise in price also signals that the net marginal benefit of consuming the good is lower, and they will buy lesser of the same quantity, thus quantity demanded falls
- Prices also determine how a good is produced, as firms will use the optimal mix of factors of production to produce a given output
- They will react to factor prices to determine which factor they will use more of less of (e.g. they will use more labor if labor is cheaper)
### Rationing role of prices
- Prices also help the market to determine for who to produce
- In their pursuit of profits, firms will only sell tho those who are willing and able to pay the price that at least covers their marginal cost of production incurred
- The goods will inly be distributed to consumers who are willing and able to pay the market equilibrium prices
## How the price mechanism achieves allocative efficiency
- Allocative efficiency is a situation where the combination of goods/ services produces maximises the total economic welfare of society
- It is achieved when marginal social benefit (MSB) = marginal social cost (MSC)
### Consumers
- The demand curve represents the maximum price that consumers are willing and able to pay for various quantities of the good
- A rational consumer will maximise net total private benefits
- They will buy an additional unit of a good as long as the marginal private benefit (MPB) of consuming is exceeds marginal private cost (MPC) of doing so
- The MPB of the good is the additional utility derived from consuming an additional unit of the good
- The MPC is the additional cost of consuming one more unit of the good, which is equivalent to the price consumers pay for the good
- Therefore, the maximum price a consumer would be willing to pay for one more unit of the good would represent the marginal utility that he derives form consuming the unit
- Hence, the demand curve is the same as the MPB curve
### Producers
- The supply curve represents the minimum price producers are willing and able to accept for various quantities of the good
- A rational producer would maximise profits
- They will sell an additional unit of a good as long as the MPB of producing exceeds the MPC
- The MPB is the additional revenue derived form selling an additional unit of the good, which is the price consumers pay
- The MPC is the cost of producing one more unit of the good (marginal cost of production)
- Therefore, the minimum price a producer would be willing to accept would represent the marginal cost of production
- Hence, the supply curve is the same as the MPC curve
### Allocative efficiency
- ==Assuming **no externalities**, in a **perfectly competitive market** for a **private good**==
- The MPC is the same as the marginal social cost (MSC), and the MPB is the same as the marginal social benefit (MSC)
- The demand curve will reflect MPB and MSB, and the supply curve will reflect MPC and MSC
![[allocative efficiency in the free market.png]]
- The market equilibrium is also the socially optimal equilibrium, where MSB = MSC, and society's welfare is maximised and allocative efficiency is achieved
**If market output is less than $Q_e$**
- For units $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, MSB is greater than MSC
- For every additional unit of output from $Q_1$ to $Q_e$, the marginal benefit to society is greater than the marginal cost incurred
- The total social benefit is given by area $beQ_eQ_1$, while total social cost is given by area $ceQ_eQ_1$
- There is a net increase to society's welfare of area $bec$ that could be gained if society was to produce and consumer $Q_1 - Q_e$ units
**If market output is more than $Q_e$**
- For units $Q_2$ to $Q_e$, MSC is greater than MSB
- For every additional unit output from $Q_2$ to $Q_e$, the marginal cost to society is greater than the marginal benefit gained
- The total social benefit is given by area $eyQ_2Q_e$, while the total social cost is given by area $exQ_2Q_3$
- There is a net loss to societies welfare of area $exy$ that is incurred because society produced and consumed $Q_e$ to $Q_2$ units
- Thus, society's welfare is not maximised and allocative efficiency is not achieved
### Allocative efficiency using CS/PS
- At the market equilibrium output $Q_e$ where the demand and supply curves intersect, the sum of consumer and producer surplus is maximised, hence society's welfare is maximised and allocative efficiency is achieved
