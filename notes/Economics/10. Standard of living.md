## Overarching goal of improved living standards
- Governments aim to achieve these 4 macroeconomic goals
1. Sustainable and inclusive economic growth
2. Low unemployment
3. Price stability
4. Favourable balance of trade
- This is becuase achieving these 4 macroeconomic goals allows them to bring about increases in society's well-being or living standards over time
## Standard of living
- Material standard of living stems form the consumption of goods and services
- Non-material standard of living refers to aspects of well-being that stems from intangibles\
## National income
- National income is the total income earned by a nation from prodcuing the country's total final output over a period of time
- National product is the value of the final output of a country over time
- National expenditure is the total spending of a country's output over time
- They are all equal
- National expenditure must equal national income becuase the amount of spending on a country's final output must equal the value of the output
- To produce the national output, firms must employ factors of production owned by the households
- All factors of production (land, labour, capital, entrepreneurship) is owned by households who offer their FOPs in exchange for income
- Firms pay for these FOPs out of the revenue they earn from selling the final output, equal to national expenditure, by paying rend, wages, interest, and profits to households
- Hence national income is equal to national expenditure
## GDP (gross domestic product)
- GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production located within a country's geographical boundaries, during a given period of time (a year)
- The value of all final goods and services are included in GDP if they are produced in the geographical confines of the country, regardless of who owns the factor of production
### GNI (gross national income)
- GNI is the value of all final goods and services produced by factors of production owned by residents during a given period of time (a year)
- The value of all final goods and services are included in GNI if they are produced by factors of production owned by residents, regardless of where they are located
- A country's residents may own factors of production located aboard, and used to produce final output overseas
- These residents will earn factor income from aboard, which is counted in GNI
- Foreigners that earn factor income from their production operations in a country and this income will flow out of the country to their home country
- This is known as factor income paid aboard and is excluded from GNI
- GNI = GDP + Factor income from aboard - Factor income paid abroad
### Real VS nominal values
- A real value is a measure of value that is adjusted for changes in prices
- GDP is the value of all final goods and services produced by FOPs located within a country's geographical boundaries during a given time period
- Since the value of a good is price times quantity of the good, a country's GDP can change due to a change in prices, or change in quantity, or both
- To find out whether an economy has grown, economists find out how the quantity of goods and services has changed over time, and use real GDP, discounting inflation
### Aggregate VS per capita values
- Real / Nominal GDP per capita measure the value of a country's output/ income in aggregate or normal terms
- To measure a country's average level of output or income, economists use per capita measures, which is obtained by taking GDP/ GNI by the population
## Comparing standards of living over time
- National income is used to indicate living standards, because it measures a nation's income level, reflecting resident's ability to consume goods and services
- National income is thus a fundamental determinant of a country's material standard of living
- Real GDP per capita is used to measure and compare a country's material standard of living over time
- We use real to account for changes in the general price level
- By valuing a country's final output at constant prices, any increases in value can only be due to a rise in output, hence the economy is more able to satisfy more needs and wants
- Whether material well-being rises over time depends on the quantity of goods and services produced has risen, rather than a mere rise in the value due to inflation
- When a rise in nominal national income is due to increase in prices with no increase in output and hence consumption, there will be no improvement in material well-being
- We use per capita to account for changes in population size over time
- If the country's real national income is rising faster than the population such that real national income per head is rising, the average person's purchasing power is rising
- This would imply that the average persons purchasing power, hence level of consumption of material  goods and services has increased, improving material SOL
## Limitations of using real GDP per capita to compare living standards over time
### Data collection problems
- National income statistics is calculated form millions of returns to the government
- Mistakes may arise due to omission, double counting, or inflation of figures
- E.g. income tax returns may be understated because information provided by taxpayers are inaccurate or incomplete
- This is especially for developing countries, where proper accounting systems are not in place and officials lack the expertise, and there are many inaccessible areas
### Size of the underground economy
- The underground economy is the sector in which transactions are not reported to official authorities, consisting of
- Illegal production (e.g. drugs); becuase of their illegal nature, these activities are not declared in income tax returns and omitted in national income figures
- Legal activities that are not declared in income tax returns
	- Moonlighting, where people do extra work outside of their normal job, but do not declare such income for tax purposes
	- Casual jobs, which is income not declared by those who are unemployed for the fear of losing unemployment benefits
- Unrecorded transactions in the underground economy understate the country's national income figures
- If the underground economy is growing, increases in real national income per capita over time will understate the rise in living standards
- The underground economy can be significant in countries where crimes like drug dealing is pervasive
### Change in size of the non-market economy
- Any output produced by labour services that do not pass through a market is not counted in national income statistics
- But, they contribute to total output of final goods and services in the economy
- Home-based/ voluntary activities or 'do-it-yourself' means that national income understates the true level of production in the economy
- E.g. painting a room yourself instead of hiring a contractor, since you are not paying yourself an income, there will be no record of it in the national income statistics
- Some countries have people grow their own croups for their own consumption and barter trade (sustenance agriculture), and this output is excluded from GDP
- This means that real GDP  understates the true level of production in the economy
### Change in distribution of national income
- An increase in real GDP per capita may not reflect an increase in income of all residents equally since real GDP per capital reports the income of the average citizen
- If the increase in income is concentrated in the hands of the rich, then the economic well-being of the average individual may not have improved
- An increasing Gini coefficient implies widening income inequality
- It helps to provide a more complete picture of how GDP is distributed, indicating the extent that real GDP per capita reflects the living standards of a typical person
- If a country's real GDP per capita is rising, but Gini coefficient is large, it would overstate the improvement in standard of living of the average person
- This is becuase the rise in income is not equally distributed among households
### Changes in composition of national income
- A country's output includes both consumer and capital goods, but current material standard of living depends only on consumer goods
- If national income rises due to a rise in production of capital goods, it will not improve current standard of living
- But it increases future production and consumption, hence future standard of living
- A rise in national income due to a rise in exports would overstate a rise in the standard of living if the income generated from exports is not spend on consumer goods
- A rise in national income due to a rise in government spending on military armaments will not lead to a rise in standard of living
- This is because such spending does not contribute to household's current wants
### Ignores material aspect of SOL
- Production processes create by-products that harm the environment
- But, real national income figures take no account of externalities produced
- Increase in production is accompanied by higher levels of pollution
- This is because firms are profit-motivated and do not take into account health costs incurred by third parties when they produce and pollute the environment
- The deterioration of the environment leads to poorer health of residents, offsetting the increase in material standard of living, overstating the increase in SOL
- If an increase in national income is due to people having to work harder or longer houses, the growth in national income may overstate the increase in SOL
- The loss in reduced leisure, leads to a fall in non material SOL, offsetting the gain in prodcuing and consuming a greater quantity of goods and services (gain in material SOL)
## Limitations of using real GDP per capital to compare living standards between countries
### Inaccuracy of national income figures
- National income statistics understate the actual level of production from country to country, depending on the size of the underground and non-marketed economy
- This is significant in developing countries, where there is a large underground economy, and large subsistence farming and agricultural sector
### Differences in currencies used and problems with using market exchange rates
- To use national income to compare standards of living between countries, there is a need to convert the national income into a common currency (e.g. US dollar)
- But, fluctuating exchange rates will give different values of GDP even when there is no change in domestic values
- Exchange rates vary from day to day
- If GDP is converted to a common currency using market exchange rates, it will fluctuate for reasons that have nothing to do with actual levels of economic activity in the country
- Market exchange rates may be a poor indicator of the relative purchasing power of the currency
- GDP is instead converted into a common currency at the purchasing power parity rate
- It is the rate of exchange that allows one to buy the same basket of goods using its domestic currency
### Differences in distribution of income
- A country's GDP per capita can be higher than another country's but the average standard of living may be lower due to greater inequality in distribution of income
- Developing countries tend to have greater disparities in income distribution as income is concentrated in the hands of the rich
- This means that the rich can buy many luxury goods, while there are many in the country living in poverty
- Thus, in comparing living standards between countries, there is a need to supplement GDP per capita with measures of income distribution
### Differences in proportion of national income spend on different types of goods
- Countries with a similar GDP per capita may produce different goods and services, and have different standards of living
- A country that spends more on defence has a lower standard of living as defence goods do not contribute to household's immediate wants
- A country that spends more on capital goods that do not satisfy household's current wants/ needs will have a lower current standard of living
- But, it will have higher material standards of living in the future
### Differences in non-material aspects of SOL
- The higher output in some countries may be accompanied by higher levels of pollution, lowering non-material well-being, offsetting the rise in SOL
- The higher GDP per capita in some countries may be due to people working harder or longer working hours, as residents have lesser leisure time and lower non-material SOL
## Why do we still use it?
- Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher material and non-material standard of living
- The higher the per-capita income levels, the greater the extent that people in the country can afford to satisfy basic material needs like healthcare
- The higher the income levels, the more tax revenue is collected and is available for the government to pursue policies that improve non-material standard of living
- Governments can incentivise firms to invest in cleaner methods of production via subsidies and grants
- They can also use these resources to enforce more stringent environmental laws
- Thus, there is also a high correlation between GDP per capita and life expectancy, which reflect non-material standard of living
## Other indicators
### HDI
- It is a composite index that combines
1. **Life expectancy** 
	- Longevity can be impacted by the access to certain goods and services, such as quality healthcare, healthy food options for better nutrition
	- A higher life expectancy implies greater access to these goods and services, and a lower life expectancy implies poorer access to these goods and services
	- Longevity is also determined by the non-material aspects of SOL such as work-life balance and air quality
	- With better work-life balance, stress levels are lower, leading to better health and longer life expectancy
	- A higher life expectancy suggest higher air quality as cleaner air reduces the risk of negative impacts such as respiratory illnesses, enabling people to live longer
	- A country with a lower life expectancy suggest poorer performance in these aspects
2. **Education index**
	- A country with higher adult literacy rates suggests greater access to educational materials such as textbooks, and services by teachers and lecturers in schools
	- A country with lower adult literacy suggest poorer access to these resources and lower material SOL
3. **Income index (GNI at PPP)**
	- Higher GNI per capita suggests greater purchasing power to buy goods and services for the satisfaction of materials wants and needs
	- A country with a higher GNI per capita has a higher material SOL and a country with lower GNI per capita has a lower material SOL
- It was made to asses the development of a country not just in economic growth alone
- But, it does not reflect poverty, security, empowerment
- It fails to reflect inequalities as it takes averages
- It uses GNI per capita instead of GDP, and inaccuracies in GNI affect the accuracy
### Leisure time
- We can measure the average working hours per worker, or the average leisure time per worker
- The more time people spend on work, the less time they have to spend on other activities
- The higher the working hours or the lower leisure time workers have, the poorer the work-life balance in the country, suggesting a lower non-material standard of living
### Pollution index
- We can use indices that measure the level of pollution
- The pollution standards index (PSI) is used in Singapore
- The higher the PSI, the poorer the air quality in Singapore, and the lower the non-material standard of living
