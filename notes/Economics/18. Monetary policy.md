- Monetary policy is a process where the central bank uses interest rates or exchange rates as an alternative instrument to achieve the macroeconomic goals of the country
## Interest rate monetary policy
### Expansionary monetary policy
- Expansionary monetary policy refers to the deliberate lowering of interest rates or increasing of money supply to boost AD
- This is to stimulate the economy and lower demand deficient unemployment during a recession
- With a lower interest rate, the cost of borrowing falls and households are incentivised to purchase consumer durables (e.g. cars)
- Consumers will also receive lower returns on their savings from banks thus lowering the opportunity cost of consumption, hence consumption (C) will be encouraged
- Firms will also undertake new investments
- This is because the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of return, is now higher than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- With a lower interest rate, some investment project that were previously not profitable might now be profitable, and investment (I) will increase

- Assuming the economy is below full employment, AD rises from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- There will be an unplanned fall in inventories, and firms will increase production by hiring more FOPs
- Household's income will increase and they will spend a portion of it on domestic goods and services, increasing induced consumption
- AD will rise further
- This leads to further increases in production and more FOPs being hired, resulting in another cycle of spending, until total withdrawals equal total injections
- There will be a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- There is actual growth and a fall in demand-deficient unemployment
### Contractionary monetary policy
- A contractionary monetary policy is where interest rates are raised or money supply is reduced so as to reduce AD
- This helps to reduce demand-pull inflation
- With a higher inflation rate, the cost of borrowing rises, and firms will cut back on investment
- This is because the marginal benefit of investment, the expected rate of return, is now lower than the marginal cost of investment, the interest rate
- With a higher interest rate, some investment project that were previously profitable might now be not profitable, and investment (I) will increase
- With a higher interest rate, the cost of borrowing rises, and consumers will decrease consumption
- Consumers will also receive higher returns to their savings from banks which increases the opportunity cost of consumption, hence consumption will fall (C)
![[demand side deflation.png]]
- AD falls, causing AD to shift from $AD_1$ to $AD_2$
- Firms will see an unplanned rise in inventories, and will reduce production by hiring lesser FOPs
- Households will receive lesser income, and they will spend lesser of it on domestic goods and services, lowering induced consumption
- AD will fall further from $AD_2$ to $AD_3$
- Firms will further reduce production and employ lesser FOPs, resulting in another fall in spending, until total injections equal total withdrawals
- There will be a multiplied fall in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_3$
- The rise in unemployment means firms are better able to get the resources that they need, resulting in more efficient factor combinations
- This reduces the cost of production, and there will be lesser inflationary pressure, causing price level to drop form $P_1$ to $P_3$
### Contractionary monetary policy to improve BOP
- With an increasing interest rate, the higher cost of borrowing will result a fall in C and I, and hence AD.
- If the fall in AD reduces national output/ income, the fall in national income ill reduce import expenditure, improving BOT and the current account
- There will also be a fall in the GPL, which improves export's prices competitiveness, leading to a rise in quantity demanded for export
- There will be rise in import revenue, assuming export are price elastic
- Local goods and services will also become cheaper than imports, causing a fall in demand for imports and reducing import expenditure
- Hence, there will be an improvement in the BOT
- A rise in interest rates can result in hot money, leading to an improvement in the capital and financial account of BOP
## Evaluation of monetary policy
### Interest rate sensitivity of consumption and investment
- During a recession, investment demand may not be sensitive to a fall in interest rate
- Firms are unlikely to borrow to invest if they are facing excessive capacity and when the expected rate of return is low due to poor business outlook
- Hence, if demand for investment is interest rate inelastic, a fall in interest rate will be met with a less than proportionate rise in stimulating I and hence AD
- Consumption is also likely to be interest insensitive in times of recession
- Households facing the prospects of retrenchment and falling incomes are unlikely to to be enticed by lower interest rates to borrow for consumption
- Hence, C and I are unresponsive to interest rate cuts due to poor consumer and investor confidence, and expansionary monetary policy may be ineffective
---
- During demand-pull inflation, a rise in interest rate may not be successful in discouraging consumption or investment
- If business and consumer confidence is high, firms will invest even if interest rate increases and borrowing is more expensive
- Thus, I is unresponsive to interest rate, and contractionary monetary policy will not be effective in reducing demand pull inflation
### Size of multiplier
- In stimulating economic growth and employment, the effectiveness of monetary policy depends on the size of the multiplier
- A country with a high MPC or low MPW will have a large multiplier, and monetary policy will be effective in raising output and employment due to the lower MPW
- A country with a high MPM, MPS, or MPT will have a small multiplier, and it will be difficult for monetary policy to raise output and employment due to the higher MPW
### Size of domestic sector
- The size of the domestic market out of GDP affects the extent of impact of interest policy
- If consumption and domestic investment are small compare to the export sector, expansionary monetary policy may not have much of an impact
- Singapore has a small domestic consumption and investment as a proportion of GDP, due to a small population size and open economy
- If it uses expansionary interest rate monetary policy to boost AD to increase national income, the rise in AD might not be significant
- Hence, interest rate monetary policy to affect AD to achieve full employment and general price stability may not be effective
### Liquidity trap
- This is when the interest rate in the country has reached its lowest possible level and cannot fall any lower
- E.g. Japan has been maintaining a close to zero interest rate for years, but consumers are not willing to spend and firms are not willing to invest
### Exchange rate system
- Under a managed float exchange rate system, a country loses control of its money supply, making interest rate monetary policy not possible
	- To address demand pull-inflation, the central bank may interest rates
	- The rise in interest rates would attract hot money inflows, causing demand for the domestic currency to rise
	- This puts upward pressure on the exchange rate
	- To prevent the currency form appreciating above the upper limit under a managed float exchange rate system, the central bank will sell the currency
	- Once foreigners buy the newly created currency in the foreign exchange market and spend it on domestic goods and services, it will end up in local bank accounts
	- This will increase the money supply in the domestic economy and thus lower interest rates, negating the effects of the original contractionary monetary policy
- Under a floating exchange rate system, monetary policy can further help the economy recover through adjustment in external demand
	- Lowering interest rates will result in hot money outflows
	- This will result in the supply of the domestic currency to increase, and the currency will depreciate
	- The depreciation will lower the price of exports, and increase the prices of import in domestic currency, encouraging exports and discouraging imports
	- Net exports rise assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, increasing AD and leading to real GDP growth and falling demand-deficient unemployment
	- Hence, monetary policy will be more effective in boosting the economy
## Exchange rate 
- Foreign exchange rate policy is a policy centred on the management of the exchange rate
### Depreciation
- A policy of exchange rate depreciation refers to a downward revision of the value of a country's currency in terms of foreign currencies
- The central bank sells the local currency is a managed float exchange rate system, and aims to switch expenditure away from foreign goods to domestically produced goods
- It does so by making exports cheaper in terms of foreign currency, and imports more expensive in terms of local currency
---
- When the central bank allows the local currency to depreciate against foreign currencies, foreigners will find exports cheaper and will increase demand for exports
- Domestic consumers will switch from buying imports to the relatively cheaper domestically produced goods
- (X-M) will rise assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, causing AD to rise
- Depreciation of the domestic currency attracts short-term capital inflows to buy financial assets as they are now relatively cheaper for foreigners
- This would increase the supply of loanable funds, putting downward pressure on the interest rate, increasing investment
- It will also attract FDI, increasing investment
- This increases AD, leading to actual growth
#### Limitations
- Depreciation may cause the price of imported inputs (e.g. oil) to rise, and with the rising price of imported inputs, local firms will see a rise in unit cost of production
- This will lead to a fall in AS, which would decrease real GDP and lead to imported inflation, and increasing unemployment
- The rising price of imported inputs may also reduce the attractiveness of FDI, and discourage long term capital flows
- If depreciation is interpreted as a signal that the central bank cannot support the forex rate, expectations of further devaluation will cause foreigners to withdraw their funds from the country, leading to short-term capital outflow
- The decrease in the supply of loanable funds will put an upward pressure on the interest rate, lowering local investment and AD
- This results in declining actual growth and increasing unemployment
#### Effects on BOP
- A depreciation of the currency would make its exports cheaper in foreign currencies and make imports more expensive in local currency
- This causes foreigners to demand more of the relatively cheaper exports, increasing export revenue
- If demand for imports is price elastic, the more than proportionate decrease in quantity demanded for imports will lead to a decrease in import expenditure
- A rise in export revenue and a fall in import expenditure would lead to an improvement in the BOT
- As long as the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, a depreciation of the currency would lead to an improvement in BOT
---
- Deprecaiton can make ia country's assets cheaper in foreing currencies
- If no further deprecation is expected, short-term capital inflows may be encouraged, as the assets are cheaper, resulting in higher returns
- But, if further depreciation is expected, short-term capital inflow will not be discouraged, and there may be capital-outflow due to speculation
- This is becuase the returns from financial investments is expected to be lower in foreign currency
- Depreciation improves export competitiveness, and should attract long term capital flows (e.g. FDI)
- But, this is uncertain as as the stability of the currency may be a more critical factor for FDI
- If the exchange rate continues to depreciate, the profit earned by the firm will be lower in the future, when the convert the profits back to their home currency
- If a country is dependent on imported inputs, the rise in production costs could reduce the attractiveness for FDI
- Hence if depreciation results in long-term and short-term capital inflows, the BOP could be improved
### Appreciation
- An exchange rate appreciation would make exports more expensive in foreign currency, leading to a fall in demand for exports and export revenue
- It also makes imports cheaper, leading to a rise in quantity demanded for imports
- This will lead to a fall in (X-M), assuming Marshall-Lerner condition holds, thus AD will be lowered, cooling down the economy
- A higher exchange rate can also lower cost-push inflation in the country due to imported inflation
- A higher exchange rate would cause import inputs (e.g. Oil) to be cheaper, and the price will not rise in terms of domestic currency,  preventing imported inflation
## Evaluation
### Price elasticity of demand for imports and exports
- To improve the trade balance, the central banks wants a weaker or depreciating exchange rate
- But, this is assuming the Marshall-Lerner condition holds, where $|PED_X+PED_M| >1$
- If the Marshall-Lerner condition does not hold, depreciation would cause (X-M) to fall instead of rise, worsening the balance of trade and affecting growth
- The demand for imports/ exports may be price inelastic in the short time
- Foreign market will take time to realise that exports are cheaper, and change their spending habits, and locals do not immediately know about increased import prices
- Firms are contractually bound to continue with certain suppliers for a certain time period before switching to a cheaper one
### Spare capacity
- If the central bank allows the depreciation of the currency to correct a BOT deficit, it will increase AD
- If there is a lack of spare capacity in the economy, demand-pull inflation will result, and the price advantage due to the deprecation is eroded due to inflation
## Nature of the economy
- For a small and open economy like Singapore, exchange rate depreciation will not be effective in improving a BOT deficit
- This is due to cost-push inflation that results from exchange rate depreciation
- When Singapore exchange rate's depreciates, export become cheaper in terms of foreign currency, but the cost of imported inputs rises, increasing the cost of production
- This will partially erode the improved price competitiveness of exports
- The depreciation will also increase the price of imported goods and services in domestic currency, increasing inflation in the economy
- If trade unions press for higher wages in view of the higher cost of living, it may result in a wage-price spiral
- This reduces the price competitiveness of exports, and the import substitution effect that was intended by the depreciation

### Causes and mix of macroeconomic problems
- Depreciation may not address the root causes of the economic problems
- For example, if the BOT deficit is due to the poor quality of a country's exports,  then supply side policies which can improve the quality of exports would be more appropriate
- The mix of macroeconomic problems present is also an important factor to consider
- If a country has both a BOT deficit and demand-deficient unemployment, then exchange rate depreciation may be appropriate, as it improves BOT and increases AD
- But, if the country has both a BOT deficit and inflation, exchange rate depreciation mat not be appropriate as it worsens inflation
### Retaliation by other countries
- When a country depreciates, its trading partners may suffer a fall in their export revenue and face stiff competition form cheaper imports
- They may retaliate by depreciating their currencies, which would offset the intended improvement in export price competitiveness
- Demand for exports may not increase by much, and a currency war may result
