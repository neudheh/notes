### Actual and potential growth
- ==Actual growth is the increase in actual national output, which is the equilibrium real national output in the AD-AS model==
- A country's growth rate indicates whether the country's national output is rising or shifting over time, and how rapidly the country's actual national output is rising
- A country is in a recession if it experiences two consecutive quarters of negative actual growth
- ==Potential growth is the increase in the capacity of the economy to produce (i.e. expansion in a country's potential national output)==
### PPC
- When a country moves form a point inside the PPC to a point closer or on the PPC, it is producing more of both goods, and there is actual economic growth
- An outward shift of the PPC, there is an increase in the economy's productive capacity, and there is potential growth
- When there are changes in quantity, quality of resources, or level of technology, the would be a shift in the PPC
## Factors affecting actual growth
### Increases in AD
- AD consists of planned consumption expenditure (C), investment expenditure (I), government expenditure (G), and net exports (X-M)
- If AD increases due to an increase in any of tis components, equilibrium real national output will increase, resulting in actual growth, assuming there is spare capacity

![[actual growth increase in AD.png]]
- The rise in AD creates shortages, causing an unplanned fall in inventories
- Firms would increase production and raise employment of factors of production
- Through the multiplier process, there will be a multiplied increase in real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
### Decreases in unit cost of production
- When there is a fall in the unit cost of production, AS rises and the horizontal portion of AS will shift down from $AS_0$ to $AS_1$
- Assuming AD remains constant, the rise in AS results in a increase in equilibrium real GDP from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$
- The rise in AS could be due to a fall in the price of factors of production, or an improvement in productivity of factors of production

![[actual growth fall in unit cost.png]]
- The rise in AS, as seen by the horizontal portion of AS shifting downwards, would lead to a fall in the general price level
- Through the wealth, international substitution, and interest rate effect, consumption ($C$), investment ($I$), and export expenditure ($X$) will rise, as seen by a movement along AD
- This movement in AD is from $Y_1$ to $Y_2$, until equilibrium is restored at a higher equilibrium national output
## Factors affecting potential growth
- A country's potential or capacity to produce can be increase in two ways, increases in quantity, or quality of factors of production
- When a country has more factor inputs, the maximum possible output that it can produce increases
- The productivity of a factor input is the output per unit of the factor input
- When a country's quantity of factors of production is the same but each unit of factor input can produce more, the maximum possible output the country can produce increases
- Potential national output will increase from $Yf_1$ to $Yf_2$ as AS has increased, and the vertical portion shifts right from $AS_1$ to $AS_2$
## Factors affecting quantity of FOPS
### Capital
- A country's capital stock is its collection of durable assets (i.e. production plants, equipment) that is used for producing other goods and services
- When the capital stock increases, it will be able to produce more goods and services, increasing the productive capacity
- A country's capital stock and increases through capital depreciation
- As long as net investment (Net investment = Gross investment - Capital depreciation) is positive, the capital stock will increase over time
- The level of investment consists of domestic and foreign investment
- Domestic investment is affected by the level of saving, the interest rate, corporate tax rate, and entrepreneurs level of confidence about future business and economic outlook
- Foreign investment is affected by exchange rate stability, ease of doing buisness, corporate tax rate, and entrepreneurs level of confidence about future business and economic outlook
### Labour
- The average working hours per worker can increase, causing the economy to be able to produce more goods and services using the same number of workers
- An increase in the size of the labour will increase a country's potential output
- The labour force is the manpower currently available in the economy, comprising of people who are working and seeking work
- A change in the population size can change the size of the country's labor force
- Changes in population size could occur due to changes in birth rates, death rates, or migration
- With a larger population size, the size of the labour force will be larger
- A change in population can affect the size of a country's labour force
- An aging population would have fewer young workers joining the labour force compared to the number of older workers that are retiring, causing the labour force to decrease
- The inflow of foreign workers increases the size of the labor force
- This depends on the attractiveness of work in the country (e.g. wage rates) and government policy towards migrant labor (e.g. foreign worker levy and quota)
### Land
- A country's quantity of natural resources increases when there is discovery of new mineral deposits
- A country's natural resources can also be depleted
- Renewable resources could be used at a faster rate than that of replacement (e.g. ocean pollution, deforestation)
- The scope for increasing natural resources is limited besides land reclamation
- But, the constraints that a fixed amount of land creates for potential growth can be overcome to some extent by optimising land use (building upwards/ deeper)
### Entrepreneurs
- Entrepreneurs bring different factors of production to produce goods and services, and bear the risk of making losses in undertaking production
- They also undertake investment in R&D which is needed for technological progress, affecting a country's potential growth rate
- The legal framework, funding, and culture affect the number of entrepreneurs
## Factors affecting the quality of FOPs
- Changes in the quality (productivity) of FOPs can affect the rate of potential growth
- Labor productivity is the amount of output obtained per unit of labour used in production
- Total factor productivity is the amount of output obtained from a given quantity of all the inputs used in production
### Level of physical capital
- Investment in physical capital increases the productivity of land and labour
- Workers in a food-processing factors could produce more output per man hour if the firm invested in additional food processors
- Each unit of labour has more capital to work with, and this will increase the productivity of labour
### Level of human capital
- Human capital is the knowledge and skills that workers acquire through education, training and experience
- Investment in human capital refers to expenditure on education and skills training/ upgrading
- Higher quality of human capital raises a nation's ability to produce goods and services through greater knowledge, higher skills, and hence higher labour productivity
### Level of technology
- Advancement in a country's level of technology in the form of process innovation will enable the same quantity of FOP to produce more in the same time period
- It can stem from R&D or transfer of knowledge from MNCs
- The ability of a nation to effect and sustain technological change depends on the
	- quality and size of the nation's educational and training system
	- level of investment into R&D
	- existence of institutions that provide individuals with the ability and incentive to innovate and bringing about technological progress (e.g. financial system that enables individuals/ firms to raise funds for investment)
## Role of the government
- The government can use supply side policies to stimulate potential growth (e.g. skills retraining)
- Their macro-management of the economy also matters
- It affects firm's investment plans and influence their long run expectations regarding their rate of return on their investments by affecting economic stability of the country
## Sustained growth
- ==Sustained economic growth is a situation where an economy's real national output increases over an extended period, without accelerating interest rates==
- Without an expansion of potential national output, increases in real national output must eventually come to an end
- This is because when the economy is at full employment, growth of equilibrium real national output will be restricted by growth of potential national output
- To sustain actual growth in the long run, potential output must continue to rise through a rise in vertical AS, together with a rise in actual output through a rise in AD
![[sustained economic growth.png]]
- AD is initially at $AD_2$ and economy is at equilibrium, and equilibrium national output is at $Y_2$, and there is spare capacity
- An increase in AD form $AD_2$ to $AD_3$ will raise the equilibrium national output from $Y_2$ to $Yf_0$, leading to actual growth
- For actual growth to be sustained in the long run, increases in AD alone are not enough as further increases in AD would only lead to further increases in GPL
- There needs to be an increase in potential national output
- For real national output to increase beyond $Yf_0$, the rise AD must be accompanied by an increase in AS, and there is expansion in the country's productive capacity
- The AS curve must shift to the right to $AS_1$, and this outward shift in the vertical of portion of AS indicates potential growth
- When this happens, the economy can now achieve an equilibrium real national beyond $Yf_0$
- When AD rises to $AD_4$, together with a rise in potential national output, a new equilibrium is reached at point $c$ and actual growth happens again
### Long term growth rate
- Governments aim for sustained growth where real GDP rises over time, and the country's real GDP follows a rising long-term trend path
- But, there may be a lack of growth in the long term due to sluggish AD and a lack of increases in potential GDP
### Short term fluctuations
- Sometimes the economy may be in a boom, where economic growth rates rises significantly due to AD rising and there is spare capacity
- When AD rises faster than AS, the actual growth rate slows and inflation rate rises
- Other times, the economy is in a bust or recession, when AD or AS falls, leading to negative growth and deflation
## Benefits of economic growth
### Higher standards of living
- If actual economic growth exceeds population growth, it will lead to higher real income per capita
- This will lead to higher levels of consumption of goods and services, leading to higher material standards of living
- As the economy grows, the same direct tax rates will yield higher revenue for the government
- This is because rising income induce increased consumption, leading to more revenue from sales tax for the government
- The increase in tax revenue enables governments to increase spending on public goods (e.g. flood control), goods with positive externalities (e.g education) and public amenities
- This increases material standard of living
- The increase in tax revenue also enables government to increase spending on cleaning up the environment, which increases non-material standard of living
### Alleviate other macroeconomic problems
- Actual growth helps to reduce demand-deficient unemployment
- If economic growth is driven by a rise in AD, there will be a rise in real output, assuming there is spare capacity
- When output increases, demand-deficient unemployment will fall as firms hire more workers to increase output
---
- Potential growth is important for standard of living to rise over time without compromising the macroeconomic goal of general price stability
- This is because as AD rises, the economy will reach full employment
- Without a growth in productive capacity, any further increases in AD will only cause demand-pull inflation, reducing the purchasing power of citizens
### Redistributive benefits
- When real national output/ income is unchanged, a redistribution of income to improve equality of distribution would make one group better off, and another worse off
- If real national income rises, by maintaining a constant tax rate, the government can redistribute more income from the rich to the poor without the rich losing in absolute terms
- As people's income rises, they will pay more taxes, increasing government revenue
- The extra revenue for the government can be spend on programs to alleviate poverty
- Without a continuing rise in national income, the scope for helping the poor is more limited
### Greater ability to address environmental degradation
- Increases in government revenue that arises from economic growth allows them to have the funds needed to fund measures to address pollution
- As people become more affluent, they can afford to be less preoccupied with their own private consumption to meet basic needs and be more concerned about the environment
- Therefore, regulation of pollution is tougher in developed countries
## Costs of economic growth
### Lower non-material standards of living
- Economic growth can come with longer working hours and higher stress levels
- Economic growth can be accompanied with a higher rate of environmental degradation and increased levels of pollution
- This is because profit-maximising firms disregard the negative externalities of their production activities
- Hence, non-material standard living might fall
### Lower current material living standards
- To achieve sustained growth, which requires potential growth, there will be a need for adequate investment such that there will be an expansion in the country's capital stock
- Investments are funded by savings
- The opportunity cost of growth is lesser consumption in the current period, lowering current material living standards
### Rise in structural unemployment
- Structural unemployment happens when there is a mismatch in skills possessed by job-seekers and those demanded by firms
- Economic growth can involve changes in production, in terms of the types of goods/ services produce and techniques used and the skills required
- The more rapid the rate of economic growth, the more rapid structural change may occur
- If the skills and knowledge of the labour force does not improve as quickly as technological advancements, people find their skills no longer relevant
- Their jobs are increasingly being replaced by machines or made redundant, resulting in structural unemployment
### Deterioration in balance of trade
- A country's balance of trade is the value of its exports minus the value of its imports
- When an economy grows, the rise in national incomes increases spending on imports, leading to a deterioration in the country's balance of trade, ceteris paribus
### Greater inequality in income distribution
- If the means to higher growth rates are given in the form of greater incentives given to specific sectors of the economy, people in these sectors get wealthier
- This is because they may see a faster rise in their disposable income or profits
- Without a transfer of income (redistributive transfers), there will be little to no benefits trickling down to people who are not in these sectors, resulting in income inequality
## Sustainable growth
- ==Sustainable growth is a state of growth that is sustained without creating other significant socio-economic issues==
### Unsustainable growth
- A country's growth rate may not be sustainable if they specialise in highly polluting industries as part of her industrialisation strategies
- This will result in greater amounts of pollution, which negatively impact future generations
- There could also be weak environmental protection laws and regulations, uncontrolled growth of motor vehicles, and reliance on more polluting fuels for power generation
### Why peruse sustainable growth
- Not all natural resources are renewable, and exploitation of it to bring about growth could mean insufficient natural resources for future generation to produce goods
- There is a trade off between rapid economic growth today, and material standards of living in the future
- Destruction of the natural environment tends to occur alongside economic growth, as profit maximising firms disregard external costs due to pollution from production
- The more rapid economic growth, the more pollution the environment must absorb
- This would lead to a depletion of clean water and breathable air for residents in the country, and future generations will suffer a fall in standard of living
### Improve factor productivity
- When economic growth is driven by increase efficiency in the use of natural resources, then economic growth becomes more sustainable
### Removing subsidies for fossil fuels/ allocating more resources to cleaner alternatives/ clean industries
- The rising prices of factors that are becoming increasingly scarce will force firms to develop alternative methods of production that can conserve on their use, and develop alternate resources
- But, some government subsidies fossil fuels to spur industrialisation and growth in the past, making economic growth less sustainable
- These lowered production costs and boosted industrialisation, but they have worsened air quality by encourage firms to use dirty sources of energy instead of clean ones
- Instead, governments can intervene to ensure more resources get allocated to clean energy and green industries (e.g. subsidies for solar and wind power)
- They can also fund R&D in these sectors which would lower costs and reduce the environmental impact of these industries
### Government intervention to tackle natural resource exhaustion/ degradation of the environment
- Free market forces are useful as factor prices will guide firms to reduce the use of increasingly scarce resources
- But, profit-maximising firms disregard the external cost of exhaustion of natural resources for future generations and degradation of the environment
- As such, government policies such as measures that lower pollution like pollution taxes can lower the environmental impact of economic growth
## Inclusive growth
- ==Inclusive growth is a rate of growth that is sustained over a period, is broad-based across economic sectors and creates productive employment opportunities for the majority of the country's population==
### Why pursue inclusive growth
- Sustained economic growth does not necessarily improved living standards for all
- A country can be growing over time with the rich getting richer and the rest of the population experiencing minimal rise in their real income or not at all
- The material standard of living of the masses in various countries has risen only marginally compared to the rich due to unequal distribution of the increase in income
---
- Some income inequality can lead to more growth
- Rising income inequality stems from profits rising at a higher rate than wages, serving as an incentive for entrepreneurs to innovate and bring about economic growth
- Those with higher income also have a higher marginal propensity to save, resulting in more investment for the economy
- But, excessive income inequality is bad for growth
- A greater concentration of income an wealth in the rich would slow down actual growth as they have a lower MPC
	- The size of the multiplier is smaller, leading to a smaller multiplied rise in real GDP and hence a slowdown in actual growth when AD rises
	- When the lower-income bracket workers are unable/ slower to transit to the middle class, their spending power is capped or growing slowly
	- With a conservative expectation of their income growth, growth in consumption slow, and there is a slower shift in AD to the right, resulting in slower actual growth
- Excessive income inequality can lead to political and social instability, leading to lower expected rate of returns of investment, causing investments to fall
	- This will dampen expansion of AD, and lowers the rate of increase in AS, and actual and potential growth slows
- Rising and excessive income inequality can lead to lowered support for mainstream political parties in favour for populist politics
	- This makes it difficult for a government to pursue necessary economic policies when needed if it involves short term pain (e.g. wage cuts)
	- This makes it difficult for the government to attain its macroeconomic goals
### Policies to redistribute income
- Increase corporate taxes, higher personal income taxes for the highest income groups, more transfer payments for the poor
### Policies to enhance equality of opportunity
- Inequality of opportunities undermines intergenerational social mobility and weakens incentives for the poor to invest in knowledge and engage in enterprise
- They thus cannot benefit from economic growth
- E.g. Equal access to high-quality education, skills upgrading, access to finance for entrepreneurship
