## Equity
- ==Equity refers to the fairness in distribution of output; and inequity is unfairness in distribution of output==
- The price mechanism distributes output to consumer based on whether they are willing and able to pay
- Since individual's ability to pay differs depending on their income levels, which differs across individuals due to income inequality, there is inequity in the distribution of output
- The free market does not consider fairness in terms of who gets the good, and how much
- Inequity, can be due to the prices of essential goods and services being too high, or the distribution of incomes too unequal
- The lower-income groups thus cannot afford necessities
## Income inequality
- ==Income equality is the extent to which income is distributed in an uneven manner among a population==
### Gini coefficient
- The Gini coefficient measures the decree of inequality in income distribution across a population, taking on a value between 0 and 1
- It is calculated with a Lorenz curve, which is graph showing the cumulative proportion of households, 
- It is ranked according to their household income on the horizontal axis and the vertical axis showing the cumulative proportion of household income
$$Gini\ coefficent=\frac{Area\ A}{Area\ (A+B)}$$
- The further the Lorenz curve is from the 45$\degree$ total equality, line, the larger will be the Gini coefficient, and the more uneven the income distribution
- If a country's Gini coefficient is higher than other countries, it implies high income inequality
- If a country's Gini coefficient is increasing over time, it implies widening income inequality in a country
## Causes of income inequality
### Unequal factor endowments
- In a a free market economy where private property is allowed, households that own land, capital, shares and labor will earn a higher income than households that own only labor
- This is because they can earn rent, interest, and profit on top of wages
- The rich provide their children with better education, increasing their chances of receiving higher wages in the future
- The wealthy leave their children with hefty inheritance, jump-starting the process of wealth accumulation
- Greater wealth inequality means a larger difference between individual's starting points, (e.g. they have more factors of production) leading to greater income inequality
### Differences in prices for the same factors of production
- There are different types of labor, skilled and unskilled
- A highly skilled individual working as a professional is likely to earn more than an unskilled individual working in a more menial occupation
## Wage determination
- In the labor market, the equilibrium wage rate is determined by the demand and supply of labor
- The demand for labor is for firms as they need workers to produce goods and services to generate revenue, while households supply labour
![[wage differnetial diagram.png]]
- The labor market demand curve shows the number of workers that firms are willing and able to hire at different wages, ceteris paribus
- The labor market supply curve, shows the number of person hours that workers are willing and able to offer for hire at different wage rates, ceteris paribus
## Movement along the labor demand curve
- An increase in the wage rate will lead to a fall in quantity of labor demanded
- Firms aim to maximise profit, and a firm will employ units of labor up to the point where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost of doing so
- The marginal benefit of employing labor is the additional revenue that each unit of labour earns for the firm
- The marginal cost of employing labor is the wage rate
- When the wage rate rises, the marginal cost now exceeds the marginal benefit of hiring an additional unit of labor
- A firm will lower its employment of labor, and produce lesser output, or substitute capital (machinery) for labor (capital-intensive method of production) that is cheaper
- It is reflected as a movement along the labor demand curve
## Factors affecting demand for labor
### Change in price of output due to a change in demand for the good
- Because labor is a derived demand, the demand for a good/ service would affect the demand for labor
- A rise in the demand for healthcare due to an ageing population would result in an increase in price
- The increase in price of healthcare means that the additional revenue that each healthcare worker contributes to the firm is higher, raising the demand for workers
### Change in labor productivity
- An increase in the productivity of labor means a rise in the output per worker, which increases the worker's revenue contribution to the firm
- Cleaners would be more productive if they were provided more training, better equipment or improved technology
- The same number of cleaners can now clean a larger area, generating more revenue for the company
- Thus, at the same wage rate, firms would find it attractive to hire more cleaners , increasing the demand for cleaners
### Change in capital productivity
- Technology has improved the productivity of capital
- This has led to companies replacing workers with machines (capital-labor substitution) in a bid to reduce their cost of production (e.g. self service kiosk)
- This would reduce firms need for labor, resulting in lower labor demand
## Movement along the labor supply curve
- An increase in the wage rate would lead to a rise in the quantity of labor supplied
- Workers are usually faced with a choice between having more income or leisure time when deciding how many labor hours to offer
- Hence, the opportunity cost of leisure time is the income forgone
- An increase in the wage rate increases the opportunity cost of leisure, and causes them to reduce leisure hours and increase the quantity of labor hours supplied
## Factors affecting supply of labor
### Changes in how many people can get qualified
- A change in the number of skilled worker for a particular industry will change the labor supply in the market
- This can be determined by government policies (e.g. licensing requirements for doctors)
- The supply of nurses would increase with higher government spending on education and training for nurses
- Additionally, labor supply may be lower and more price inelastic for professions that have some degree of difficulty in securing the prerequisite qualifications
- A doctor needs 10 or more years of education and training, and relatively few people have the ability and desire to undergo such lengthy and difficult training
### Changes in population demographics
- An aging population means that labour size is falling as the number of people in the population that enter retirement exceeds the number of new entrants in the labor force
- Hence, there would be a fall in labor supply
### Changes in foreign labor policy (immigration)
- The influx of such foreign workers results in a high supply of workers
- Thus, the wage rates of such occupations are low
- The gradual tightening of inflow of foreign labor has led to a fall in labor supply 
### Changes in attractiveness of the job role
- The attractiveness of a job is dependent on the job characters such as working condition
- Some people may be attracted to join the healthcare sector as they can care for others
- But, the long working hours may discourage many from joining
## Wage differentials between occupations
- Wage differentials occur because there are differences in the levels of demand and supply for these occupations
- Certain occupations generate more revenue than others for any given level of employment
- A lawyer can help a law firm generate more revenue, than a waiter generating revenue for a restaurant
- This results in the demand for waiters being lower
- A lower labor supply would give to a higher wage rate, compared to that with a higher labor supply
### Why wage differentials persist
- Wage differentials persists due to labor immobility
- Occupational immobility is the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between occupations or industries
- Geographical immobility is the inability or/ and unwillingness of factors of production to move between occupations or industries
- Worker earning low wages are not able to join markets where the wage rate are hgiher
- Supply on better paying jobs remain low and wage rates continue to be high in those markets
