## Third degree price discrimination
- Third degree price discrimination is where consumers are segmented into different groups are being charged different prices for the same product for reasons not arising from cost differences
- Firms charge a higher price for consumers with a price for consumers with a price inelastic demand, and a lower price for other consumers with a price elastic demand
- The firm has to be able to set price, making it only possible for imperfectly competitive firms as they have some market power
- The firm has to identify and separate into separate and identifiable groups, and each group must have different price elasticities of demand
- The market must be kept separate, and no possibility of resale or seepage between markets
---
- Assuming a firm sells its output in two markets (adults and students)
- Demand for adults is price inelastic as the price of the product takes up a small proportion of their income
- Demand for students is price elastic as the price of the product takes up a large proportion of their income as they have a small income
- The combined DD and MR faced by the firm is obtained by summing up the DD and MR faced in both markets
- The profit-maximising level of output is where $MC = MR$
- Since the PED differs between the two markets, the firms can charge different prices in the two markets to earn more revenue for the same output produced, earning more profit
- The firm should charge a higher price and sell less for adults
- When $|PED|<1$, an increase in price from $P$ to $P_A$ would lead to a less than proportionate fall in quantity demanded $Q$ to $Q_A$, leading to higher revenue earned
- The increase in revenue from the increase in price will be more than the revenue lost from the fall in quantity demanded
- The firm should charge a lower price and sell more
- When $|PED|>1$, a fall in price from $P$ to $P_B$ would lead to a more than proportionate increase in quantity demanded from $Q$ to $Q_B$, leading to higher revenue earned
- The fall in revenue from the fall in price is lesser than the rise in revenue from the more than proportionate rise in quantity demanded
- With the total cost faced by the firm the same, price discrimination allows the earn to earn more profits as total revenue has increased
---
**Consumers**
- Consumers with a price inelastic demand are negatively impacted as they are charged a higher price, consume less and lose consumer surplus
- Consumers with a price elastic demanded benefit as they are charged a lower price, consume ore and gain consumer surplus
**Efficiency**
- Price discrimination can be an advantage to the community, when the good is a necessity (e.g. public transport), which is not profitable if a single price was charged
- The firm can earn more revenue to cover costs, allowing the good to be supplied
- There will be provision of goods that would otherwise be unprofitable to produce, improving allocative efficiency
- If the firms channel the additional profits towards innovation, there is dynamic efficiency
- If the firm makes use of profits gained  to beak into another market, there is productive and allocative efficiency due to increased competition
**Equity**
- It can improve equity if the market is segmented into income groups
- Lower income households spend a larger proportion of income on healthcare and might get priced out of such services if a uniform price was charged
- With price discrimination, lower income households with price elastic demand can now better afford healthcare, improving equity
## Advertising
- Advertising is an activity of making a product known to the public to persuade them to purchase it
- It can be persuasive to subjectively influence about the quality and desirability of its product, relying on aesthetic and emotional appeal (e.g. celebrity influence)
- It can be informative, relying on information of the product, informing consumers about prices, characteristics, locations, and conditions of sale
- In perfectly competitive markets, advertising does not exist as consumers have perfect information and product homogeneity
- Monopolistic competitive firms have limited finance resources as they only earn normal profits in the long run, and engage in lest costly types of advertising (e.g. social media)
- Oligopolies/ monopolies have the financial resources as they earn supernormal profits in the long run, and can create brand loyalty through advertising
---
![[advertising and product innovation.png]]
- Advertising can alter the tastes and preferences of consumers, increasing the willingness of consumers to purchase the product, increasing demand for it
- It creates brand loyalty, and consumers will perceive rival's products as less close substitutes (imagined product differentiation), causing demand to be less price elastic
- Thus, with a rise in demand and fall in PED, firms can charge a higher price and earn higher profits
- Profit will increase if total revenue is able to cover the rise in total costs due to advertising
- Demand increases from $D$ to $D'$, and becomes less price elastic
- Increased spending on advertising causes average cost to rise from $AC$ to $AC'$ (MC does not increase as advertising is a fixed cost)
- The rise in total revenue (area $P'Q'$ - area $PQ$) is greater than the rise in total cost (Area $AC'Q'$ - Area $PQ$)
- The firm that was initially earning normal profits, would case profits to rise to $(P'-AC')\times Q'$
---
 **Firms**
 - Firms would experience a fall in demand and total revenue
 **Consumers**
 - Informative advertising makes more information available, and consumers make more informed decisions to maximise welfare
 - It also signals to consumers the quality of product, addressing imperfect information
 - Persuasive advertising distorts choices because consumers are led by the advertisements to buy a product for its brand instead of the characteristics of the good
 **Government**
 - Informative advertising makes more information available, and the perceived marginal private benefit is closer to true marginal private benefit, improving allocative efficiency
 - Persuasive advertising distorts consumer choices, where perceived marginal private benefit is higher than true marginal private benefit, worsening allocative efficiency
## Product innovation
- Product innovation is developing new products, or improving the quality of products through R&D
- Improving the quality of a good over time could result in real product differentiation between the firm's product and that of its rivals, reducing the degree of substitutability
- R&D is a fixed cost
*same explanation as advertising*
## Process innovation
- Process innovation is improving the method of production which leads to a more efficient production process, reducing the marginal cost of production from $MC_0$ to $MC_1$
- Average cost will also fall form $AC_0$ to $AC_1$ since average cost is total cost divided by total
- If the average cost falls more than the fall in price, profit per unit for the firm rises
![[process innovation.png]]
---
**Other firms**
- Other firms will experience a fall in demand and a fall in total revenue
- New technologies from firm's investment in product quality or production method can deter entry of potential entrants and lower contestability of the market
**Consumers**
- Product innovation would make new and better-quality products, increasing consumer satisfaction/ welfare
- Process innovation lowers prices, increasing consumer surplus
**Government**
- Innovation results in dynamic efficiency
- Process innovation improves export price competitiveness, increasing quantity demanded of exports and export revenue will rise if exports are price elastic
- Product innovation improves non-price competitiveness of exports, increasing demand and thus export revenue
- This will lead to actual growth
- Process innovation increases factor productivity, lowering unit cost of production and increases productive capacity, increasing AS, and there is actual and potential growth
- Innovation can change methods of production with improved technology, and may lead to structural unemployment
## Growth and diversification
### Internal expansion
- Internal growth is expansion of firms by investing in new plants/ outlets
- They can also expand internally by growing their market share through advertising or product innovation, increasing revenue
- When firms produce a higher quantity of output, they can reap internal EOS and enjoy lower cost of production, achieving higher profits
- But, internal expansion is uncertain and difficult, as firms face difficulties in raising  funds for investment
- R&D and advertising may not be successful
### External expansion
- Merger is the coming together of two or more firms to make a single firm
- A firm might merge with its competitors as it can earn greater supernormal profits as it can reap substantial EOS and market size increases, increasing profits
- Acquisition is when one firm takes over another firm and completely establishes itself as the new owner
- A incumbent firm can put in a takeover bid for any new entrant easily because of its strong financial capability
- This discourages new entrants because their efforts and resources spent in creating a new company would be eliminated upon acquisition
- It is a fast and sure way to grow
- But, it can lead to internal dis-EOS as difficulties in communication and coordination among the staff due to different corporate cultures
### Diversification
![[diversification of firms.png]]

---
**Other firms**
- When a firm expands, competitors find it harder to compete against the expanded firm due to the greater EOS, allowing it to reduce prices
- They will suffer a fall in demand if they are unable to match the reduction in price, allowing the expanded form to consolidate its market share
- If a firm expands through diversification via vertical integration, competitors face increase challenges in obtaining inputs or gaining access to product markets
- This is because the expanded firm exercises greater control over the previous or next stage of production
- If competitors cannot compete against the firm, it will earn subnormal profits in the long run and exit the market
**Consumers**
- Firms can enjoy cost savings, and pass these onto consumers through lower prices
- But if the firm establishes a monopoly in the market in the long run, consumers may suffer higher prices in the future as the firm can set higher prices to increase profits
- Consumers may also get lower quality goods as a monopoly becomes complacent and has less incentive for innovation
**Government**
- As firms earn more profits, it can invest into R&D and achieve dynamic efficiency
- But, if these firms establish greater market dominance, there will be lesser competition and reduce allocative and productive efficiency
- If firms that produce key inputs expands and enjoy unit cost savings, there would be an increase in AS, resulting in economic growth
## Collusion
- A collusion is an agreement among firms to divide the market or to fix market price to maximise economic profits
### Formal
- A cartel is a formal explicit collusion where a group of firms establishes a virtual monopoly by agreeing openly upon a uniform price in the market
![[collusion.png]]
- The cartel takes over the price and output decision form firms, behaving like a monopoly
- The demand curve is given by the industry demand curve
- The cartel maximises profits by producing at output $Q$, where industry $MR = MC$
- Each member firm commits to the cartel derived price, and produces and sells only its agreed upon share of the cartel's output ($Q'$)
- But, members have strong incentive to cheat by producing more than their designated quota
- With price and marginal revenue fixed at a level higher than the individual firm's MC, producing more than the quota would generate higher profits
### Informal
- Firms mostly do not openly come together to agree on a price, known as informal collusion
- The firm follows the prices set by a firm known as the price leader
- The price leader can be a dominant firm with the largest market share 
	- Smaller firms are afraid to differ in their pricing, as this can invite retaliation and a price war from the firm
	- The larger firm has more resources, capacity and better branding than its rivals, it is more likely to survive the price war
- The price leader can also be the low-cost price leader, who has the lowest cost of production
	- The firm can charge a price that is lower than the average costs of its rival, inflicting heavy losses
- It can also be a barometric price leader, which can respond more than quickly than its rivals to changing costs and demand conditions
	- It acts as a barometer of market conditions for the rest of the industry
### Conditions
- The number of firms cannot be too large, as the greater the number of firms, the harder for them to negotiate an acceptable allocation of output
	- It is also easier to cheat and produce more than the quota as it is difficult for other members to find out who cheated
	- As each firm has smaller market share, the consequence of any firm cheating has lesser impact on the overall market, making other firms less likely to retaliate
- The product has to be homogenous
	- If the products were highly differentiated, each firm's MC would be different from each other, making it difficult to agree on a common price
- A cartel is more likely to work if there is dominant producer that is larger than its rivals
	- This allows it to enforce the quota and punish cheaters by increasing production to force price down, starting a price war
---
**Consumers**
- Consumers suffer higher prices and lower consumer surplus
**Government**
- Price is pushed up even higher than MC, leading to greater allocative inefficiency
- Firms can become complacent, disincentivising innovation, lowering dynamic efficiency and possible X-inefficiency
## Predatory pricing
- Predatory pricing is an attempt by a firm to undercut its competitors by lowering its price in order to drive them out of business
- Firms that engage in predatory pricing are willing to charge a price below their own AC and earn subnormal profits temporarily to dive out competitors
- Incumbent firms ability to charge a low price would drive out smaller firms
- Smaller firms have a smaller capacity, and producing at a lower output, and only make normal profit at the market price
- If firms were to engage in predatory pricing and charge a price under their competitor's average total costs, the smaller firm will make subnormal profits if they match the price
- If not, they will suffer a fall in demand for their product, the subnormal profits will cause them to exit the market in the long run
- The firm can increase its market share and market power as its competitors leave the market, and raise prices to increase profits
- But, if unsuccessful, the firm may earn subnormal profits and exit the market
- Predatory pricing could be due to poor business conditions where the overall market demand is declining for the industry
- A firm would cut prices to clear its stock, starting a price war
- A firm may also use a recession as an opportunity to force its rivals into bankruptcy by starting a price war
- In a price war, all firms earn lower profits as prices are lower
- Firms with lower costs or deeper reserves from past profits earned are more likely o survive as they can sustain losses for longer and outlast their competitors
---
**Other firms**
- Other firms will see a fall in profits
**Consumers**
- In the short-run, consumers benefit as prices are lower and output rises
- In the long-run, when other firms are driven out of the market, the remaining firm has higher market power and charges higher prices, reducing consumer welfare
**Government**
- In the short-run, price wars lower prices and increase output, bring us closer to the allocative efficient level
- Income is equally distributed as firm's supernormal profits are eroded, and consumers benefit from lower prices, leading to a more equitable distribution of goods and services
- In the long-run, it worsens allocative efficiency and equity as the remaining firm would raise prices 
## Limit pricing
- Limit price is the minimum price that a firm can charge to make an acceptable level of profit while preventing new firm from entering the market
- Oligopolists or monopolists earn supernormal profits, attracting new firms
- Firms can charge the limit price that is below the short run profit maximising price, but above the average cost to at least make normal profits, just enough to prevent new firms
- If successful, businesses can maintain their market power and make higher profits in the long run
![[limit pricing.png]]
- The profits maximising price and output where $MR=MC$ is at $P_1$ and $Q_1$
- Firms who enter the industry can produce at $P_1$ at a small of output $Q_a$
- At $Q_a$, the new firm's average cost will be equal to $P_!$, and it can earn normal profits at survive
- The oligopolist can opt to produce at $Q_2$, and charge a lower price $P_2$, and total profits are not maximised
- But, the firm can keep its profits for longer by preventing new firms from entering the market
- The new firm has to charge price $P_2$ and produce $Q_b$ to achieve enough economies of scale to compete
- The larger initial firm size makes it harder for new firms to enter the industry as they financing and risk in starting out with a larger scale of operation is higher
## Advertising
- Using advertising, a firm can build up brand loyalty, and consumers would have an established recognition of their brant in the market
- This would deter potential entrants as consumers are less likely to purchase the new firm's product since they are unfamiliar with it
- New firms would need to spend on advertising to get consumers to try their product, deterring new firms from entering the market
- Thus, this creates a barrier to entry by raising market penetration costs
![[advertising.png]]
- Advertising builds brand loyalty for the incumbent firm that advertises
- This raises the average cost for new firms if they believe they also need to engage in advertising to compete, making it difficult for new firms to break into the market
- Without advertising, the cost structure of the firm is illustrated by $LRAC_1$, and a larger firm produces at output $Q_2$, with average cost being $C_2$
- A new firm can produce at output $Q_1$, but at a higher average cost of $C_1$
- But, if the incumbent firm was to engage in advertising, this would cause average cost to $LRAC_1$ to $LRAC_2$ for all incumbent firms an new entrants
- At low levels of output, $LRAC_2$ is higher than $LRAC_1$ as advertising costs are spread over very little output
- But, as output rises, $LRAC_2$ converges towards $LRAC_1$
- This is because the contribution of advertising to average cost becomes less significant as it is spread out over a larger output
- The incumbent firm producing at $Q_2$ would incur average costs $C_4$, while new firms producing $Q_1$ will incur average cost $C_3$
- The cost difference between the incumbent firm and the new firm has increased from $C_1C_2$ to $C_3C_4$
- Hence the it is harder for new firms to compete against the larger firm as it has a cost disadvantage, deterring them from entering
## Innovation
- Through process innovation, firms can lower their marginal costa hence prices, making it harder for potential entrants to compete based on price 
- This is because they do not have the same access to technology and knowledge
- Through product innovation, firms can create better quality products and build loyalty, reducing the likelihood of consumers switching away to new firms
- Potential firms cals face difficulty in creating products of comparable quality to compete
- Incumbent firms can also create multiple variants of their product in order to fill the market, making it difficult for new firms to find a niche in the market to enter
---
**Other firms**
- It is more difficult for new firms to enter the market as they have to incur higher costs or find a differentiated product to break into the market
- This reduces the contestability of the market, and raises the market power of the firm
**Consumers**
- Consumers may initially enjoy lower prices from limit pricing, or increased consumer choice form product innovation
- But, firms with higher quality product cannot enter the market, resulting in a loss of potential improvement in consumer welfare
**Government**
- Entry deterrence lowers the level of competition in the market, which results in allocative and productive inefficiency
- Entry deterrence may also deter new firms with newer and better technology/ products, hindering dynamic efficiency
## Revenue maximisation
- Firms are run by professional managers who may want to maximise their own utility
- The success of managers may be judged by the level of a firm's sales (i.e. salaries, power and prestige depends on sales revenue)
- Manager's promotion prospects depend on how well they have marketed the product rather than wether profits are maximised
- Managed may also be paid commission on sales
![[revenue maximisation.png]]
- Firms maximise revenue by producing the level of output $Q_3$  where $MR=0$
- But, profit is maximised at $Q_1$ where $MR=MC$, and revenue-maximisation leads to a higher output and a lower price than profit-maximisation
- But, if the minimum acceptable profit is normal profit, the revenue-maximiser may produce $Q_2$ to earn a satisfactory level of profits
---
**Other firms**
- Firms set a lower price, leading to a fall in demand for the goods and profits for competitors
**Conumers**
- Consumers enjoy lower prices
- Firms have lesser profits to invest into R&D, and there is a potential loss of newer/ better quality products
**Government**
- Income distribution is now more equal as firms earn lesser supernormal profits, which was previously at the expense of consumer paying higher prices, improving equity
- Firms have lesser profits to invest into R&D, and dynamic efficiency is reduced
- Less incentive to be productively efficient due to a lack of drive to minimise costs to maximise profits
## Profit-satisficing
- Due to imperfect information, firms may find it difficult to practise profit maximisation as the revenue and cost conditions they face are not fully known
- The cost of obtaining enough information to make profit-maximising decisions could be  high in some cases (e.g. they have several productions/ multiple product offerings)
- Firms may also be content with a profit-satisficing level to avoid stress or perceived challenges from expansion
- Profit-satisficing behaviour occurs when firms aim for minimum acceptable levels of revenue and profit
- Additionally, the shareholders of the firm who aim to maximise profits could be too far removed from the operations of the firm to be fully aware of the optimal decisions that need to be made to maximise profits
- The decision makers, such as regional managed could decide against profit-maximising decisions in cases where they do not stand to benefit
- They could instead achieve a level of profit that is acceptable to shareholders even though it falls below the maximum, and enjoy other benefits like shorter operating hours
## Social objectives
- Some firms have social objectives like environmental considerations or ensuring fair wages
- This means that they would have to sacrifice profits as it incurs higher operating costs or channel profits towards investments in these social causes
