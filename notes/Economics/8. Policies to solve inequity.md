## Maximum price (price ceiling)
- A maximum price is the maximum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a particular good/ service
- Maximum prices helps to make the prices of goods more affordable
![[price ceiling.png]]
- For it to be effective, the price must be set below the market equilibrium price
- This is because the market equilibrium price is still attainable if it is below or at market price
- At the maximum price, there is a shortage of goods and services in the market of $Q_sQ_D$ units
- Without a price ceiling, a shortage would put upward pressure on price, causing price to rise until equilibrium is restored
- However, the price ceiling creates a persistent shortage, and an alternative allocation system is needed (e.g. first come first served)
### Welfare effects (deadweight loss)
- Assuming the initial equilibrium output $Q_e$ is allocative efficient
- A price ceiling create a shortage of $Q_sQ_d$ units and the quantity sold drops from $Q_e$ to $Q_s$
- For the additional $Q_e-Q_s$ units, the increase in total social benefit is greater than the increase in total social cost
- This results in a welfare loss of area $uew$, due to underconsumption of $Q_e-Q_s$ units
### Welfare effects (consumer/ producer surplus)
- Consumer surplus falls from area $aeP_e$ to $auwP_{max}$
- Consumers who are able to obtain the good at the lower price benefit, but there will be some consumers who cannot obtain the good as quantity purchased falls from $Q_e$ to $Q_s$
- Producer surplus falls from area $P_Ece$ to $P_{MAX}wc$
- Overall, there is a welfare loss of area $uew$
### Discussion
- Easy to implement quickly and the effects are immediate, making it viable for the short-term
- Less costly as it only needs monitoring and administrative costs
- Welfare loss
- Consumers who are able to obtain the good at the lower price benefit, but there will be some consumers who cannot obtain the good as quantity purchased falls from $Q_e$ to $Q_s$
- The shortage worsens in the long run, as supply becomes more price elastic over time, causing the shortage to rise
- Does not address the root cause of the high prices
- Black markets can emerge, where goods are bought at the legal price and sold at price above the price ceiling, undermining the objective of making goods affordable
## Minimum price (price floor)
- A minimum price is a minimum permissible price that producers may legally charge for a particular good or service
- Can be done by law, or by a government guaranteeing to buy up a good at a stipulated price
- They help to protect the income of low-income producers (e.g. farmers) by raising their revenue or preventing their revenue from falling, increasing their income levels
![[price floor.png]]
- For it to be effective, it must be set at a price above the market equilibrium price
- This is because the market equilibrium price is still attainable if it is below or at the market equilibrium price
- The price floor will ensure that the prices of goods and services will not fall considerably, stabilising prices and protecting producer's incomes, improving equity
- But, it will generate a persistent surplus
- The market price rises to $P_{MIN}$ and quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$ while quantity supplied rises to $Q_s$, creating a surplus of $(Q_S-Q_D$) units
### Welfare effects (by legislation)
- Consumer surplus falls from $aeP_E$ to $ajP_{MIN}$
- Assuming perfect information, producers would reduce their quantity supplied to $Q_D$, as producing more would result in a surplus, causing them to incur storage costs or wastage
- Producer surplus falls from  $bP_Ee$ to $bkjP_{MIN}$
- This results in a welfare loss of $jek$
### Welfare effects (by government buying surplus)
- Consumer surplus falls from $aeP_E$ to $ajP_{MIN}$
- Quantity supplied increases to $Q_S$ units while quantity demanded falls to $Q_D$ units, creating a surplus which the government buys up
- Producer surplus rises from $beP_E$ to $bmP_{MIN}$
- The sum of consumer and producer surplus increases by amount $jme$
- But, this cam at a cost to society in the form of the government having to incur spending of $Q_DjmQ_s$ in order to buy up the surplus
- Thus, society incurs a net welfare loss of the M-shaped area $Q_DjemQ_S$
### Discussion
- Governments may incur lower costs compared to a subsidy, especially where prices are exceptionally low
- Welfare loss
- If the government buys the surplus and disposes/ destroys it, especially for perishable goods, there is a wastage of resources
- Firms might become complacent and lack incentive to engage in innovation resulting in dynamic inefficiency
- Firms also lack incentive to reduce cost, leading to productive inefficiency
- While producers gain, consumers lose
- Consumers face higher prices, lowering their ability to consume goods and services, worsening inequity
- If the government buys the surplus, it incurs costs, the cost of storing the surplus, and opportunity cost, and it is fiscally unsustainable
## Subsidy
- A subsidy is a payment made by the government to producers to encourage the production of certain goods or services, but not in exchange for any goods or services
- Subsidies help to lower the prices of essential goods and services, increasing the affordability, improving equity in the distribution of goods/ services
![[production subsidy equity.png]]
- The subsidy per unit is equal to the distance $P_0-P_2$
- With a production subsidy, firms will see fall in their cost of production, and thus supply will increase
- As supply increases, the price will fall, and the supply curve will shift downwards by the amount of the subsidy
- The lower price will cause consumers to increase their quantity demanded to $Q_2$
- Consumers pay a lower price of $P_2$, and producers receive a higher price $P_0$ for each good
- The government spend the area $P_0bcP_2$ as subsidy
- The extent to which equilibrium price falls and equilibrium quantity increases depends the PED
- The more elastic the demand for the good is, price will fall less significantly, but quantity consumed will increase more than proportionately
### Welfare effects (deadweight loss)
- If the initial equilibrium output was below the socially optimal level of output, thus allocative inefficient, subsidies would result in allocative efficiency
- But, if the initial equilibrium output was allocative efficient, subsidies would result in greater welfare loss
---
- Assuming the initial equilibrium output $Q_1$ was allocative efficient
- A subsidy would cause equilibrium price to rise to $P_2$ and output to rise $Q_2$
- There is allocative inefficiency due to overproduction
- For the additional $Q_2-Q_1$ units, the increase in total benefit is less than the increase in total cost
- This results in a welfare loss equal to area $bce$
### Welfare effects (consumer/ producer surplus)
- Consumer surplus rises from $abP_1$ to $acP_2$
- Producer surplus rises from $dbP_1$ to $deP_0$
- Government spends the are $P_0ecP_2$ on the subsidy
- Thus, there is a welfare loss of area $bec$
### Discussion
- Necessities such as food have price inelastic demand, due to a limited number of close substitutes, thus, there would be a significant fall in price, greatly improving affordability
- Subsidies might not be sustainable if the government is facing a sustained budget deficient, or has a tight fiscal budget
- The government also incurs an opportunity cost
- Trade off between efficiency and equity
- Subsidising a particular market needs to be funded through indirect taxes in another market, leading to allocative inefficiency in both markets, and greater welfare loss
## Promoting R&D
- Process innovation can decrease the marginal cost of production, increasing supply
- This would lead to a surplus at the original price $P_1$, causing price to fall to $P_2$
- The government can bring about process innovation by providing research grants
![[R&D inequity.jpeg]]
### Discussion
- Allocative efficient, as successful R&D lowers the equilibrium price and raises equilibrium quantity, and $Q_2$ is the new socially optimal level of output
- Addresses the cause of the rising price
- But, R&D taxes time and may not be successful
- Funding R&D incurs an opportunity cost
## Minimum wage
- A minimum wage is the minimum hourly rate of pay enforced by law
- This helps to protect workers against low pay, ensuring some basic standard of living for workers and a more equitable income distribution
- Workers are guaranteed a wage above the market equilibrium wage rate
![[Minimum wage.jpeg]]
- The government imposes a minimum wage rate $W_{MIN}$ above the market equilibrium wage rate $W_E$
- There is an increase in quantity supplied of labor to $Q_S$, and a fall in quantity demanded of labor to $Q_D$
- This causes unemployment as there is excess labor (surplus)
- But, this raises wage rates of those who are employed
### Discussion
- Firms are incentivised to raise productive of capital to reduce their reliance on labor which is now more costly
- Workers may seek to raise productivity to avoid unemployment
- However, it increases unemployment
- Some workers may offer to work below the minimum wage to stay employed, and some people may be illegally employed
## Income redistribution
### Transfer payments
- A transfer payment is any expenditure by the government for which it receives no goods and services in return
- They usually involve the transfer of income from one good of individuals (taxpayers) to another, usually in cash
### Vouchers
- Vouchers are a form of in-kind transfers, which households can redeem for specific goods and services
- They ensure that the poor get what they need most, than have them squander it on vices such as alcohol and gambling
---
- These increase the income of consumers, increasing their purchasing power, and they will demand more goods and services
- This will shift the demand curve to the right
- Consumers are now able to purchase more units of the good at each price level, improving equity as households have greater access to goods and services 
- It may also improve the standard of living of lower income households
### Welfare effects
- If the initial output was allocative inefficient, the government can increase output level to the allocative efficient level, improving allocative efficiency
- But, if the initial output was allocative inefficient, vouchers would result in a welfare loss
- Vouchers with an expiration date would cause consumers to use the vouchers even if they do need it 
---
![[Vouchers inequity.jpeg]]
- Assuming the initial equilibrium output  $Q_1$ is allocative efficient, vouchers would increase demand, causing equilibrium price to increase to $P_2$ and output t rise to $Q_2$
- There is overconsumption of $Q_2-Q_1$ units, and there is allocative inefficiency
- For the additional $Q_2-Q_1$ units, the increase in total benefit is less than the increase in total cost
- This results in a welfare loss of area $abc$
### Discussion
- Vouchers target specific groups, while subsidies benefit all households, who can afford the good
- But, it is costly as administrative costs are incurred to identify lower-income households, and the costs of execution
- It can lead to a crutch mentality, reducing the incentive to work as it may be more worth it to consider receiving aid rather than taking up a low paying job
## Direct taxes
- Direct taxes are taxes levied directly on the income, wealth, and profits of individuals and firms
- Taxes help to generate revenue, which can improve equity if used for redistributive policies
- A progressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from the high income earners than it does from the lower income earners
- It reduces the post-tax income of the rich and increasing the income of the poor when the tax revenue is redistributed in the form of transfer payments
- It is implemented in the form of progressive personal income tax, where the average tax rate increases with income, and the rich have to pay a higher proportion of their income
- The government can also raise certain direct taxes (e.g. capital gains tax), as the rich earns most of the capital gains
### Discussion
- It stifles work incentives, as the marginal return to work effort is reduced, and causes skilled labor to move to countries with lower income taxes, reducing productive capacity
- Workers may hold back on their maximum productivity as any additional effort which brings about wages increases may be taxed more heavily, resulting in underemployment
- High income earners are discouraged from saving due to the higher income tax rates on the interest they earn from saving, reducing the supply of loanable funds
- This increases the interest rate, reducing investment, and reducing economic growth and standard of living in the long run
## Indirect taxes
- A tax on good and services is called an indirect tax
- Firms have the legal responsibility to pay such taxes to the government, but some of the tax may be be passed onto consumers through higher prices
- The government an implement selective indirect taxes on goods and services by cutting tax rates on goods that are consumed more by the poor, and raising tax on luxury goods
![[indirect tax inequity.jpeg]]
- With an indirect tax, the marginal cost of production increases, causing supply to fall, and the supply curve shifts upward
- The distance between the supply curves is given by the distance $P_2-P_0$
- This causes a shortage at the original price, putting upward pressure on the prices, until a new equilibrium price is reached at $P_2$ and quantity $Q_2$
- As a result, consumers pay a higher price $P_2$ for each unit of the good, while producers receive a lower price $P_0$
- The tax revenue earned if the demand for the good is price inelastic since the fall in equilibrium quantity is less than proportionate compared to the rise in price
### Welfare effects (deadweight loss)
- Assuming the initial equilibrium output $Q_1$ is allocative efficient, an indirect tax causes supply to fall, and equilibrium price rises to $P_2$ and output to fall to $Q_2$
- There is allocative inefficiency due to underproduction
- For the additional $Q_1-Q_2$ units, the increase in total benefit is greater than the increase in total cost, resulting in a welfare of area $bcd$
### Welfare effects (consumer/ producer surplus)
- Consumer surplus falls from $abP_1$ to $acP_2$
- Producer surplus falls from $ebP_1$ to $edP_0$
- The government collects $P_2cdP_0$ as tax revenue
- The welfare loss to society is thus area $bcd$
### Discussion
- The tax revenue collected can be channeled into redistributive measures
- It is flexible as government can increase taxes for certain goods and services
- Trade-off between efficiency and equity
- It is regressive, the amount levied on goods applies equally for the poor and the rich
- As the poor spend a larger proportion of their income on consumption, goods are now more unaffordable for the poor as the price has increased
## Skills upgrading
 - It improves the employability and potential productivity of workers, which improves income equality
- Education and skills training can enable lower income groups to escape the viscous cycle of inadequate education, poor training, low productivity and poor quality jobs with low wages
- With these upgraded skills, workers will be more likely to be able to enable industries with higher labour demand and command higher wages
- Skills upgrading results in increased productivity, which leads to a rise in demand for labour as workers are seen to be more valuable (as the contribute more to total revenue now)
- This increases the equilibrium wage rate without creating excess of supply of labour in the market
