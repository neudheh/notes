## Principle of superposition
- ==The principle of superposition states that the resultant wave displacement is given by the vectorial sum of the individual wave displacement at the point where the waves meet==
- Interference refers to the phenomenon of two or more waves of the same kind meeting at a point in space to produce a resultant wave disturbance 
- The resultant wave disturbance is given by the superposition of individual waves at that point
![[constructive and destructive inteference.png]]
- Constructive interference when waves are meeting in waves, and the amplitude of the resultant wave is the sum of the amplitude of each individual wave
- Destructive interference occurs when the waves meet out of phase by $180\degree$, and the resultant wave has an amplitude of zero
## Stationery waves
- ==Stationary waves are formed from two waves interfering that are==
	- ==of the same frequency (hence same wave speed and wavelength)==, 
	- ==same type==,
	- ==same amplitude==,
	- ==travelling in exactly opposite directions crossing each other==

### Properties
![[stationary waves diagram.png]]

- The wave is divided into segments or loops by the pattern of nodes and antinodes

| Property   | Progressive waves                                                                                 | Stationary waves                                                                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Amplitude  | Amplitude is the same for all of the particles in the path of the wave                            | Amplitude varies according to positions, from zero at the nodes to a maximum at the anti-nodes                       |
| Freqeuency | All particles oscillate at the same frequency                                                     | All particles oscillate at the same frequency except at the nodes                                                    |
| Wavelength | The wavelength is the distance between any two consecutive points on the wave with the same phase | The wavelength is two times the distance between a pair of adjacent nodes or antinodes                               |
| Phase      | All particles within one wavelength have different phases                                         | All particles within the same segment are in phase; particles in alternate segments are out of phase by $180\degree$ |
| Waveform   | Propogates with the speed of the wave                                                             | No propogation of the wave profile                                                                                   |
| Energy     | Energy is transmitted in direction of travel of the wave                                          | No transmission of energy, energy is retained within vibratory motion of the wave                                    |
### Reflection from free and fixed ends 
#### Fixed end
- E.g. Rope fixed at one end, sound reflected from the closed end of a pipe
- When a wave pulse arrives at a fixed end, the arriving wave pulse will exert a force on the fixed end
- By newton's third law, the support will exert an equal but opposite force on the pulse, causing the reflected pulse to be inverted with respect to the incoming pulse
- The reflected pulse suffers a phase change of $180\degree$
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere destructively at the fixed end to produce a node
#### Free end
- E.g. Rope looped around a vertical pole, sound reflected from the open end of a pipe
- When a wave pulse arrives at a free end, the end of the rope is free the move
- Hence, the reflected pulse will not be interfered with respect to the incoming pulse
- The incident and reflected pulses will interfere constructively at the free end to produce an antinode
![[reflection from free and fixed ends.gif]]
### Stretched springs at both ends
- A continuous wave train of fixed frequency can be produced by plucking at one end of a stretched spring fixed at both ends with a specific tension
- When the wave train reaches the fixed end of the spring, reflected waves travelling in opposite directions will overlap and superpose or interfere with the incident waves
- The interference produce transverse stationary waves which vibrates transversely as a whole
![[modes of streched string.png]]
### Longitudinal stationary wave in sound
![[longitudinal stationary wave in sound.png]]
- Sound waves are produced by a signal generator of known frequency through a loudspeaker
- The incident waves are reflected by a smooth plane reflector and the two wave will superpose to give a stationary wave
- We can detect nodes and antinodes using a microphone attached to a CRO with a suitable time base setting
- By shifting the microphone along the line between the loudspeaker and reflector, the trace on the CRO is seen to vary from a minimum at 2 to a maximum at 1 and 3
- The wavelength of sound waves can be found by measuring the distance between 2 nodes
- The period of the sound wave can be found from the CRO, and we can derive the frequency
- This lets us find the speed of sound
### Longitudinal stationary waves in air columns
![[closed pipe.png]]
- The particles at the closed end cannot vibrate as there is no room to vibrate
![[closed pipe modes.png]]
- There is no second/ fourth harmonic for a closed pipe; there are only odd harmonics, no even
#### Closed pipe
![[open pipe.png]]
![[open pipe modes.png]]
- It has both odd and even harmonics
### Kundt's tube
![[kundt's tube.png]]
- The bottom of Kundt's tube is coated with cork powder
- The speaker is used to transmit sound waves into the tube
- The sound waves reflect off the closed end, and interferes with the incoming wave to form a stationary wave
- The light cork powder gets agitated and settles at the nodes
- The distance between adjacent heaps of powder is half a wavelength
## Diffraction
- ==Diffraction refers to the spreading or bending or bending of plane waves when they encounter an aperture or obstacle, whose linear dimensions is comparable to the wavelength of the wave==
### Ripple tank
- A ripple tank with a plane vibrator is used to generate plane waves
- Apertures of different sized relative to the wavelength of waves are used to obstruct the progress of plane waves
![[diffraction.png]]
- When the wave passes through the slit, the wavelength remains the same as the wavefront before
- The smaller the aperture size relative to the wavelength, the greater the amount of spreading/ diffraction of the incident plane waves
### Laser beam
- An opaque slide with a fine rectangular slit is placed in front of a laser beam
- The transmitted light falling on a distant screen shows that the illumination of the screen goes beyond the geometrical size of the slit
- The light beam spreads after passing through the slit
![[single slit.png]]
#### Angle of deviation of the first minimum
- The angle subtended by the straight-through position and the line from the single slit to the first minimum is called the angle of deviation of the first minimum
  $$\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- $\theta$: Angle of deviation ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: slit width ($m$)
#### Single slit resolution
![[resolution of single slit.jpg]]
- When little or no interference occurs between the light passing through different parts of the slit, two distinct bright spots or images would be observed
- If the two sources are closes, diffraction patterns will overlap and the images are not distinguishable
- When the central maximum of one image falls on the first minimum of another image, the images are just resolved
- The limiting resolution is known as Rayleigh's criterion
  $$\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- $\theta$: Angle between the two sources ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: slit width ($m$)
- Since $\lambda<<a$ in most situations, $\sin\theta\approx\theta$ 
  $$\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$$
- $\theta$: Angle between the two sources ($rad$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $a$: slit width ($m$)
![[rayleighs criteron.png]]
## Interference
- The two sources must be coherent (constant phase difference)
	- This implies they have the same frequency and wavelength and maintain a constant phase relation with each other
	- Otherwise, interference patterns might change so fast that they are hard to detect
	- E.g. Two loudspeakers fed from the same signal generator
- They must have roughly the same amplitude 
	- If one wave has an amplitude that is much larger than that of the other, even if destructive interference, the amplitude of the resultant wave will not be zero
	- Hence, no dark fringes will be seen, and the contrast between light and dark fringes may be so slight that the interference pattern is not visible
- For transverse waves, they must be polarized in the same plane or unpolarized
	- If the two waves have polarization directions that are perpendicular to each other, they will not interfere and will simply mix
	- There will be no superposition taking place, and no interference pattern is observed
- The light source must be monochromatic (one color or same wavelength)
	- A normal light bulb which emits a continuous range of frequencies of light cannot be used
	- A light source which is able to emit light of very exact wavelengths such as a sodium lamp or mercury lamp must be used
### Constructive (maxima)
![[constructive inteference.png]]
- Let two waves from sources $S_1$ and $S_2$ that are coherent and in phase meet and interfere at P
- If the $S_1P=S_2P$, the waves will meet at P in phase and a maximum will be produced at P
- A maximum is obtained when
	- Path difference = $1\lambda,2\lambda,3\lambda,...$
	- Phase difference = $2\pi rad, 4\pi rad, 6\pi rad, ..$
![[constructive inteference results.png]]
### Destructive (minima)
![[destructive interference.png]]
- If the path difference $S_1P-S_2P=\frac{1}{2}\lambda$, the waves will meet at P out of phase, and a minimum will be produced
- A minimum is obtained when
	- Path difference = $\frac{1}{2}\lambda, \frac{3}{2}\lambda, \frac{5}{2}\lambda, ...$
	- Phase difference = $\pi rad, 3\pi rad, 5\pi rad, ...$
![[destructive inteference results.png]]
### Ripple tank
- Using a ripple tank with two dippers controlled by the same vibrator frequency, two sets of coherent ripples are established and overlap to make the following interference result
![[two source interference ripple.png]]
## Young's double slit experiment
![[double slit.png]]
- The source slit $S$ is needed to limit the light waves reaching $S_1$ and $S_2$ to a tiny part of the light source, making the waves coherent
- We can also use a laser beam that is shone perpendicularly on $S_1$ and $S_2$
- Light coming out of $S_1$ and $S_2$ will diffract so that they overlap and interfere
- A screen on which alternate bright and dark interference fringes are formed and observed
### Deviation of nth bright fringe
![[equation for nth bright fringe.png]]
- The path difference is $S_1P-S_2P=S_2A=d\sin\theta$
- For constructive interference, $d\sin\theta=0\lambda,1\lambda,2\lambda,...$
- From $\Delta OBP$, $\tan\theta=\frac{y_n}{D}$
- Since $D>>d$, $\theta$ is small and $\tan\theta\approx\sin\theta$
- Thus, 
  $$y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$$
- $y_n$: Deviation of nth bright fringe ($m$), $\lambda$: wavelength ($m$), $D$: distance from screen ($D$), $d$: slit separation ($m$)
### Fringe separation
![[fringe seperation.png]]
$$\Delta y= \frac{\lambda D}{d}$$

### Intensity distribution
- The regular intensity distribution of the fringes is obtained only if the slit width of the double slits is equal to one wavelength
  ![[realtive intensity when d is one wavelenght.png]]
- In practice, this is usually not the case
  ![[relative intensity in reality.png]]
- The unequal intensities of the bright fringes is due to the diffraction effect that occurs when the light gets diffracted by each of the double slits
- Let the waves from each slit be of amplitude $A$
- Intensity of each wave $\propto A^2$
- The total intensity of two waves $\propto 2A^2$
- At positions of maxima, intensity $\propto (2A)^2 = 4A^2$ 
- At positions of minima, intensity = 0
- Hence, the law of conservation is not violated
- The effect of interferences simply redistributes the energy to bright fringes (maxima) with higher intensity, and reduces that at the dark fringes
## Diffraction grating
![[diffraction grating.png]]
![[diffraction grating alternative.png]]
### Grating spacing
$$d=\frac{1\times10^{-3}}{N}$$
- Where $d$: Grating spacing ($m$), $N$: Lines per mm
### Angle of deviation
![[angle of deviation diffraction grating.png]]
- Path difference  = $d\sin\theta$
- For constructive interference, $d\sin\theta=0\lambda,1\lambda,2\lambda,...$
- Therefore, $$d\sin\theta=n\lambda$$
-  $d$: slit separation ($m$),$\theta$: Angle of deviation, $\lambda$: wavelength ($m$)
### Maximum order of diffraction
- Since $sin\theta \leq 1$, from $d\sin\theta = n\lambda$, $\frac{n\lambda}{d}\leq1$
- Thus, $$n_{max}\leq\frac{d}{\lambda}$$
- $n_{max}$: maximum order, $d$: Fringe separation ($m$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
>[!NOTE]
>We cant use $y_n = \frac{n\lambda D}{d}$ or $\Delta y = \frac{\lambda D}{d}$, as we cannot assume that $\theta$ is small
>To find $y_n$, first use $sin \theta = \frac{n\lambda}{D}$, then use $tan \theta = \frac{y_n}{D}$
### Angular dispersion of white light
- If light consisting of a range of wavelengths is used, they would be separated after passing through the grating (i.e. dispersion)
- This will give rise to the colour spectrum of the light source
- The shortest wavelength (e.g. violet) will be diffracted least.
![[angular dispersion of white light.png]]
- We can use $dsin\theta= n\lambda$
