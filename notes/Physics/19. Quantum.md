## Photoelectric effect
- When light of a higher enough frequency is incident upon the surface of a metal, electrons are emitted from the surface of the metal
- The incident light was not wave-like, but behaved like projectiles (photons) hitting the surface of the metal
- The energy of the photon is given by
  $$E=hf=\frac{hc}{\lambda}$$
- $E$: Energy ($J$), $h$: Plank's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $c$: Speed of light ($3\times10^{8}ms^{-1}$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
### Experiment
![[photoelectric experiment.png]]
- Light of variable but known frequency and intensity is shown through a quartz window into an evacuated glass envelope
- The quartz window allows for the passage of visible and ultraviolet light
- The light is shown on an emitting electrode E, which made of a photosensitive material, and C is the collecting electrode, which collects electrons from E
- The electric circuit allows for the electrode to be maintained at different known potentials, and allows the measurement of any current between electrodes
- The direction can be reversed by reversing the power supply
- Any current that flows can be measured by a very sensitive ammeter
### Work function
- Applying the laws of the conservation of energy, Energy of incident photon = Kinetic energy of ejected electron + work function of metal
- ==The work function of a meta is the minimum amount of energy required to take a free electrons out of a metal against the attractive forces of surrounding positive ions==
  $$hf=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\phi$$
- $h$: Plank's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $v$: Velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $\phi$: Work function ($J$)
- 1 electron-volt ($eV$) is the amount of kinetic energy that an electron gains when it is accelerated through a potential difference of one volt ($1eV=1.6\times10^{-19}J$)
### Observations
- From $hf=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\phi$, the threshold frequency must correspond to a minimum energy packet to liberate an electron, hence 
  $$\phi=hf_0$$
- $\phi$: Work function ($J$), $h$: Plank's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}$), $f_0$: Threshold frequency ($Hz$)
- Electron emission is the result of a direct collision between an electron and a photon, so there is no time delay before emission starts
- Photoelectrons are ejected with a range of speeds, as electrons deeper in the metal have a higher work function, and thus have lesser kinetic energy
- Thus, the different photoelectron speeds are due to photoelectrons being ejected form different layers of the metal
- From $hf=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\phi$, the maximum kinetic energy of an electron is independent of intensity of the light, and dependent of frequency instead
- The photoelectric current is a measure of the number of photoelectrons emitted per second $$I=\frac{Q}{t}=(\frac{n}{t})_ee$$
- $I$: Current ($A$), $Q$: Charge ($C$), $t$: Time ($s$), $(\frac{n}{t})_e$: Rate of arrival of electrons, $e$: Charge of an electron ($1.6\times10^{-19}C$)
- The light intensity is a measure of the rate of arrival of photons
  $$I=\frac{E}{tA}=(\frac{N}{t})_p\frac{hf}{A}$$
- $I$: Intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $E$: Energy ($J$), $t$: Time ($s$), $A$: Area ($m^2$), $(\frac{N}{t})_p$: Rate of arrival of photons, $h$: Plank's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
- The photoelectric current is proportional to light intensity, because greater light intensity means more photons striking the metal surface per unit area per unit time
- Thus, more photoelectrons are emitted per unit time
## Stopping potential
 ![[stopping potential.png]]
- The set up above is to measure the maximum k.e. of photoelectrons
- When light is shown onto emitter E, electrons are ejected and move towards the collector C
- This causes a current to flow in the external circuit, which is detected and measured by the ammeter shown
- If the p.d. across the cathode and the anode is reversed using the external voltage supply, such that the anode is negative with respect to the cathode, electrons will be repelled by the cathode
- If this reverse voltage is large enough, even the fastest photoelectrons will be prevented from reaching the anode, causing the current to decrease to zero
- The potential difference is called the stopping potential
- At the stopping potential, the work done on the electron by the E field is equal to the loss in kinetic energy of the fastest electron ($eV=\frac{1}{2}mv^2$)
- From $hf=\frac{1}{2}mv^2+\phi$, $hf=eV+\phi\rightarrow V=\frac{h}{e}f-\frac{\phi}{e}$ 
- Hence, light of different frequencies shone on the same metal will result in different stopping potentials to reduce the measured current to zero
### Potential-frequency graph for different metals
![[potential-frequency graph.png]]
- All the graphs have the same gradient $\frac{h}{e}$, but have different y-intercepts $\frac{\phi}{e}$
### Current-potential
![[current-potential different wavelengths.png]]
- Same intensity -> same rate of arrival of photons
- Same metal
- Different wavelengths, hence frequencies of incident light used
- Hence, they have different kinetic energy and different stopping potentials
![[current-potential different intensities.png]]
- Same wavelengths, hence frequency of incident light used
- Same metal
- Different intensities, hence more photoelectrons are emitted for Q, causing current to be higher
## Wave nature of particles
- Particles can behave like waves
  $$p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$$
- $p$: Momentum ($Nm$), $h$: Planck's constant ($6.63\times10^{-34}$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
- This relationship applies to particles such as electrons and protons, as well as photons
### Electron diffraction
![[electron diffraction.png]]
- A beam of high-speed electrons is directed at a thin sheet of crystalline nickel
- While passing through the metal, the electrons encounter the metal atoms and become scattered, so that emerging electrons are travelling at an angle to that of the original beal
- In this way, the nickel sheet acts as a diffraction grating, with the individual nickel atoms acting as slits
- The resulting interference patterns shows that the electrons after being scattered by the atoms in the metallic crystal, appear to interfere with each other as if they were waves
- Where they interfere constructively, a bright fringe is seen, and where they interfere destructively, a dark fringe is seen
## Heisenberg's uncertainty principle
- Heisenberg's uncertainty principle is the result of the wave nature of matter
- If the position of $x$ of a particle has uncertainty $\Delta x$, then its momentum $p$ measured in the same direction as x, as an uncertainty $\Delta p$, such that $$\Delta x\Delta p\geq h$$
- $\Delta x$: Uncertainty of position ($m$), $\Delta p$: Uncertainty of momentum ($Nm$)
- The more precise you know $x$, the less precise you know about $p$
### Single-slit
![[heisenberg's uncertainty principle.png]]
- The brightest part of the fringe pattern is where the most photons per until time strikes the screen, while the darkest part is where no photons strike the screen
- A single photon will hit the screen directly in front of the slit
- But, when we have a large number of photons passing through the slit, they give a wide diffraction pattern, and do not just hit the area directly in front of the screen
- We do not know what part of the slit the photon passes through
- Hence there is uncertainty about the position of the photon in the x direction in the moment that it passes through the slit, which is at most equal to the slit width $a$
- Hence, $\Delta x = a$
- The photon can hit anywhere between the first two-order dark fringes, so after passing through the slit, there is a variation $\Delta p$ in its momentum in the $x$ direction
- The variation in momentum can range from 0 to $p\tan\theta$
- Since the fringe pattern extends beyond the first order dark fringe, $\Delta p\geq p\tan\theta\approx p\theta$ (since $\theta$ is small)
- From single slit diffraction, $\sin\theta=\frac{\lambda}{a}$, hence $\Delta p\geq p\frac{\lambda}{a}\rightarrow \Delta p\geq p\frac{\lambda}{\Delta x}$
- From $p=\frac{h}{\lambda}$, hence $p\geq \frac{h}{\lambda}\frac{\lambda}{\Delta x}\rightarrow\Delta p\Delta x\geq h$
## Energy levels in atoms
- The electrons in an atom can only have certain energy values known as energy levels 
- They are represented by horizontal lines, arranged one above the other with each line indicating a particular energy value in a energy level diagram
- These energy levels correspond to the electron orbits of an atom
![[energy level diagram.png]]
- Atoms of an element have the same set of energy levels which is a characteristic of the element itself
- Different elements will have different energy levels
- ==The quantum state with the lowest possible energy level is called the ground state, with quantum number== n=1
- An atom is most stable when every electron is at the ground state since this is the lowest energy state available
- All quantum states with greater energies are called excited states of the electron
- If the energy of an electron at rest outside an atom (n=$\infty$) is taken as zero, then all the energy levels have negative energy levels
- If an electron is raised to the level n=$\infty$, the electron escapes from the atom, and the atom is said to be ionised
- ==Ionisation energy is the energy required to raise the electron from energy level n=1 to n=$\infty$==
### Gaining/ losing energy
- An electron gain move from one level to another by gaining or losing energy
- It can also bypass one or more intermediate energy levels
- But, it is not allowed to gain or lose an amount of energy that would out the electron in between two energy levels 
- Since the energy levels of the electron are quantised (only have certain energy levels), the electron can only accept or give out parcels of energy of specific values
- If an atom gains energy by absorbing a photon, the electron in the atom will move from a lower energy level to a higher energy level
- The energy of the photon must match exactly the energy difference between the two levels, if they do not match, the photon will not be absorbed and will be scattered away
- The energy needed to raise the atom from its ground state to an excited state is known as the excitation energy
- The atom is in an excited state and is unstable, and does not stay in the higher energy level for long
- It quickly de-excites to the lower level by decreasing its energy by emitting the energy that was absorbed in the form of a photon
- The atom can also gain energy by collision with an external particle
- It can cause excitation as long as the energy is sufficient for that transition, and any remaining energy will remain on the incident electron/ atoms which scatters away
## Line spectra
### Emission line spectra
![[emission line spectra setup.png]]
- Emission line spectra is produced by gasses (e.g. sodium) in a discharge tube
- The gasses must be a low pressure so that the atoms are far apart and they are not interacting with each other 
- In the discharge tube, the gaseous atoms are excited by electrical means
- Free electrons emitted at the cathode are accelerated to the anode by a high voltage
- When one of the election is involved in a collision with the gas, the atom gains energy and it will move to a higher energy level
- The atom is unstable and quickly returns to the lower energy by emitting a photon
- The wavelength of the photon depends on the energy levels involved
![[emission line spectrum.png]]
- A set of coloured lines on a dark background is observed, where each of the spectral lines corresponds to a particular frequency or wavelength
- The wavelength of each radiation appears as a line because a slit is used in the set up
### Absorption line spectra
![[absorption line spectra set up.png]]
- White light passes through a cooled gas
- Photons from the white light which have exactly the right amount of energy to cause excitation of the atoms are absorbed
- Photons which have not been absorbed will pass through the gas
- The electrons absorb the energy from the photons and move to higher energy levels
- When the atoms return lower energy levels, they emit photons of the same wavelength in all direction, therefore very little is emitted in the original straight through direction
![[absorption line spectrum.png]]
- The intensity of the absorbed wavelengths is therefore lesser than the intensity of the other wavelengths that are not absorbed
- Thus, a series of dark lines on a continuous coloured background is observed
- The parts of the spectrum corresponding the the absorbed wavelengths will appear dark in comparison to the other wavelengths that were not absorbed
- The fact that the absorption lines are well-defined and separated form each other proves that atoms have quantised energy levels 
### Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen Series
![[emission line spectra of hydrogen atoms.png]]
- A hydrogen atom can jump between quantised energy levels by emitting or absorbing radiation
- The Lyman series has jumps that start/ end with the ground state, which produces ultraviolet radiation
- The Balmer series has jumps that start/ end with the first excited state, which produces visible light
- The Paschen series has jumps that start/ end with the second excited state, which produces infrared light
## X-ray spectrum
- An X-ray spectrum can be produced in an evaluated tube, where a target metal is bombarded by high speed electrons
- X-rays are electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength ranging from $0.01nm-10nm$, or frequencies ranging around $10^{18}Hz$
- X-rays are very high energy photons which have high penetration power
- As X-rays are ionising radiation, it can be dangerous and exposure should be limited
![[x-ray setup.png]]
![[x-ray spectrum.png]]
### Braking radiation
- The continuous distribution of x-rays is due to bremsstrahlung, or braking radiation
- As an electron in the x-ray tube interacts with one of the target atoms, the electron interacts with one of the target atoms, the electron decelerates
- The electron loses an amount of energy, and this energy is emitted as an x-ray photon
- The scattered electron may have a second interaction with another target atom, generating a second photon whose energy is different from the first photon
- This electron-scattering process will continue until the electron loses all its energy and becomes stationary
- The photons generated by all these interaction form the continuous x-ray part of the spectrum
### Minimum wavelength
- The minimum wavelength corresponds to a collision in which an incident electron loses all of its kinetic energy in a single encounter with the target atom
- Hence, $\frac{hc}{\lambda_{min}}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2\rightarrow\lambda_{min}=\frac{2hc}{mv^2}$
- From the expression, the cutoff wavelength is independent of the target material
### X-ray peaks
- The wavelengths of these peaks are characteristic of the elements in the target, and thus can be used to identify elements in a specific sample
- The peaks are associated with X-ray photon produced by inner-shell electron transitions from higher energy electron shells to lower energy electron shells
- The peaks have specific wavelengths due to the fixed energy (quantised) transitions between electrons shells, whose energy levels are discrete
- The peak intensities are also high because all of the atoms of the metal target have the same set of inner-shell electron levels
- An energetic electron bombards an atom in the target, and knocks out one of the atom's inner shell (lower energy) electrons
- This leaves a vacancy/ hole in the shell, which is quickly filled by electrons dropping down from higher levels
- They will emit X-rays with sharply defined frequencies associated with the difference between quantised atomic energy level of the target atoms
- These are called characteristic X-rays and are represented by a series of peaks in the X-ray spectrum
