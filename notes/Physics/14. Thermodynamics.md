## Internal energy
- ==Internal energy is the sum of the kinetic energy due to the random movements of the particles, and potential energy due to the intermolecular forces between particles==
  $$Internal\ Energy\ U = molecular\ KE + molecular\ PE$$
### Ideal gas
 - Real gasses behave like ideal gasses at high temperature and low pressure
 - Under such conditions, the potential energy due to intermolecular forces becomes much less significant compared with the molecular kinetic energy
 - Thus, an ideal gas does not have any potential energy and internal energy is purely translational kinetic energy of the molecules
  $$U=\frac{3}{2}NkT=\frac{3}{2}nRT$$
- $U$: Kinetic energy ($J$), $N$: number of molecules of the gas, $k$: Boltzmann's constant ($1.38\times10^{-23}JK^{-1}$), $T$: Temperature ($K$), $n$: Number of moles ($mol$), $R$: Molar gas constant ($8.31Jmol^{-1}K^{-1}$)
### Changes in internal energy
- Internal energy of a system is dependent on its state variables (pressure, volume, temperature)
- A change in internal energy does not depend on the path taken from one state to another
### Work done by a gas
- When a gas expands, the bas has to do work to push back the atmosphere
  ![[Work done by a gas.png]]
$$W_{BY} = p\Delta V$$
- $W_{BY}$: Work done by the gas ($J$), $p$: Pressure ($Pa$), $\Delta V$: Change in volume ($m^3$)
- When a gas contracts, work is done on the gas
  $$W_{BY} = -W_{ON}$$
- In general, as the gas volume changes, the pressure will not stay constant
- Instead, we can find the work done using $$\int{p}dv= Area\ under\ the\ P-V\ graph$$
## First law of thermodynamics
- The first law of thermodynamics states that the increase in the internal energy is equal to the heat supplied to the system and the work done on the system
  $$\Delta U=Q+W_{ON}$$
- System gains internal energy -> $\Delta U$ is positive; system loses energy -> $\Delta U$ is negative
- Heat is supplied to the system -> $Q$ is positive; heat is extracted from the system -> $Q$ is negative
- Work is done on the system -> $W_{ON}$ is positive; work is done by the system -> $W_{ON}$ is negative
### Isochoric (constant volume)
![[isochoric.png]]
- Area under the vertical line is zero, since volume is constant
- No work is done on the gas -> $W=0$
- $\Delta U = Q + W \rightarrow \Delta U = Q$
- All the heat absorbed or released by the system is used to increase or decrease the internal energy of the system
- Internal energy increases since temperature increases
### Isobaric (constant pressure)
![[isobaric.png]]
- Work done by the system $W =-p\Delta V$
- Increases in internal energy $\Delta U=Q+W=Q-p\Delta V$
- Hence, $Q=\Delta U+p\Delta V$
- The heat supplied is used to increase the internal energy of the system and do work in expansion
### Isothermal (constant temperature)
![[isothermal.png]]
- Change in internal energy $\Delta U$ is zero since temperature is constant
- $\Delta U=Q+W\rightarrow Q = -W$
- All of the heat supplied is from work done by the system
### Adiabatic (no heat input)
![[adibatic.png]]
- No heat is supplied or extracted -> $Q = 0$ 
- $\Delta U=Q+W \rightarrow \Delta U=W$
- E.g. change of volume of a gas in an insulated container
### Cyclic
![[cyclic.png]]
- A cyclic process is one where the starting and end point of the process is the same
- At the end of the process, the gas is at the same state, therefore the internal energy is them same
- $\Delta U=Q+W\rightarrow Q = -W$
- The net work done on the system is equal to the net heat removed from the system or vice versa
### Melting
- At the melting point, the heat supplied is used to weaken the intermolecular bonds and increase the intermolecular separation slightly
- The heat supplied is not used to increase molecular kinetic energy, so temperature remains constant
- The volume of the substance hardly changes, so the work done is zero
- $\Delta U= Q+W\rightarrow\Delta U=Q$
- The heat supplied is equal to the increase in internal energy (only potential energy)
### Boiling
- Heat supplied is used to break the intermolecular bonds, leading to an increase in molecular potential energy
- As the liquid turns into a vapor, volume is greatly increased as the molecules move further apart, leading to a further increase in potential energy
- The vapor does work as it pushes back into the atmosphere
- $\Delta U = Q + W  \rightarrow = Q = \Delta U - W$
- Heat supplied is equal to the increase in internal energy and the work done by the vapor

>[!NOTE]
>- In melting, the intermolecular bonds are only weakened, and the intermolecular separation hardly changes
>- In boiling, the intermolecular bonds are broken, and the intermolecular separation increases greatly
>- Therefore, $\Delta U$ and $W$ are much greater for boiling than melting
>- The specific latent heat of vaporisation is higher than fusion

### Evaporation
- Evaporation is similar to boiling as heat from the surrounding is absorbed to break intermolecular bonds and increase intermolecular separation
- This causes cooling of the surroundings
