## Types of forces
- A force is a push or a pull
- It is an interaction between two objects or between an object and its environment
- It is a vector
- It has the SI unit of the Newton ($N$)
- One newton is the amount of fore required to give a $1kg$ mass an acceleration of $1ms^{-2}$ 
  $$1N = 1kgms^{-2}$$
### Applied force
- Applied force is a force that is applied to an object by a person or by another object
- E.g. A person exerts an applied force on a box to pull it
### Normal force
- ==The normal force is the support force exerted on an object that is in contact with another object==
- It is always perpendicular to the surface of contact
- E.g. When a box rests on a table, the table exerts a normal contact force on the box
### Friction
- ==Friction is a force between two surfaces that are sliding or trying to slide across each other==
- Friction opposes motion when the surface of one object comes in contact with the surface
- Friction is caused by irregularities in the surfaces in contact and depends on the surface in contact, as well as how much they are pressed against each other
- Static friction prevents objects from motion, which exists when two surfaces are not sliding across each other
- Friction is proportional to normal force, which is why it is harder to push a heavier object
- Friction can also not oppose the direction of motion, such as walking or a car turning
### Drag/ Viscous force
- Drag is a kind of friction when there is relative motion between an object and a fluid
- Viscosity is the degree of internal friction in a fluid, the higher the viscosity, the higher the viscous force
- In air, drag is known as air resistance, and in liquid, drag is known as viscous force
### Tension and compression
- A tension force is one that pulls materials apart, stretching the body and tensioning it
- A compression force is one that squeezes material together, compressing the body
## Hooke's law
- Hooke's law states that the deformation of an elastic object is proportional to the applied force, provided the limit of proportionality is not exceeded
  $$F=kx$$
- $F$: Force ($N$), $k$: spring constant ($Nms^{-1}$), $x$: Deformation ($m$)
- The spring constant is a measure of stiffness of the object
### Elastic potential energy
- The work done to stretch/ compress an elastic material is stored as elastic potential energy
- The energy is store until the force is removed and the object springs back to its original shape
- The EPE can be found from the area under the force extension graph 
  $$EPE=\frac{1}{2}Fx$$
- $EPE$: Elastic potential energy ($J$), $F$: Force ($N$), $x$: Deformation ($m$)
- Using $F=kx$, 
  $$EPE=\frac{1}{2}kx^2=\frac{F^2}{2k}$$
- $EPE$: Elastic potential energy ($J$),  $k$: spring constant ($Nms^{-1}$), $x$: Deformation ($m$), $F$: Force ($N$)
- The work done in extending a spring form $x_1$ to $x_2$ is given by 
  $$EPE = \frac{1}{2}k(x_2^2 - x_1^2)$$
### Combination of springs
#### Series
- All springs will experience the force $F$ on it
  $$x_{eff}=x_1+x_2+...$$
- From $F=kx$,
  $$\frac{F}{k_{eff}} = \frac{F}{k_1} + \frac{F}{k_2}+...$$
  $$\frac{1}{k_{eff}}=\frac{1}{k_1}+\frac{1}{k_2}+...$$
#### Parallel
- All springs will experience the same extension $x$
  $$F_{eff} = F_1+F_2+...$$
- From $F=kx$,
  $$xk_{eff} = xk_1 + xk_2+...$$
  $$k_{eff}=k_1+k_2+...$$
## Upthrust
- A object that is partly or completely submerged in a fluid experiences a greater pressure on the bottom surface than on the top
- The difference in pressure produces a force known as upthrust
- Consider a solid of uniform cross-sectional area $A$ in a fluid 
  ![[Upthrust.png]]
  $$U = F_{bottom} - F_{top}$$
  $$U = P_2A - P_1A$$
  $$U = [(P_0+ \rho gh_2)-(P_0 +\rho gh_1)]A$$
  $$U = (h_2-h_1)\rho gA$$
  $$U=HA\rho g$$
  $$U=V\rho g$$
  - $U$: Upthrust ($N$), $V$: Volume ($m^3$), $\rho$: Density of fluid ($kgm^{-3}$), $g$: Gravitational field strength ($Nkg^{-1}$)
### Archimedes Principle
- ==Archimedes principle states that when an object is partially or totally immersed in a fluid, the upthrust on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of fluid displaced== 
### Principle of floatation
- ==The principle of floatation states that when an object floats on a fluid, the upthrust on the object is equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the weight of the object==
## Center of gravity
- The center of gravity is the point at which all of the weight of the body acts or appears to act
- The weight does not act at a single point, it is distributed all over the entire boy
- But, we can assume the weight is concentrated at a point called the center of gravity4
- We can often use symmetry to find the center of gravity
- For a sphere, cube, circular sheet or rectangular plate, the center of gravity is at its geometric center
### Irregular shapes
- For complex shapes we can find the center of gravity using a support and a plumbline
- Since the weight of the object is concentrated in the center of gravity, the force of gravity passes through this point in a vertical line towards the earth
- An object hanging from any point will automatically rotate so that its center of gravity is along this vertical line from the hanging point
- I.e. Hanging the shape at any point will cause the shape to rotate until the center of gravity lines up directly below the hanging point
  ![[centre of gravity of lamina.png]]
- Drawing a line along the plumb line enables us to see the vertical line between the hanging point and the center of the earth
- But one line is not enough to pinpoint the exact center of gravity as it could be anywhere along the line
- Thus we hang the shape at a different point and draw another line along the plumb line
## Turning effects of forces
- ==The moment of a force about an axis is the product of the force and the perpendicular from the line of action of the force to the axis== 
  $$M=F\times r$$
- $M$: Moment ($Nm$), $F$: Force($N$), $r$: Perpendicular distance ($m$)
- SI unit of Newton meter ($Nm$)
- If F is not perpendicular, we can resolve the force or the distance to the axis
### Couples
- A couple is two parallel forces that are equal in magnitude, opposite in direction, and do not meet
- The resultant force of a couple is zero, but the resultant torque is not zero
- The resultant torque is given by 
  $$\tau = F\times D_{\perp}$$
- $\tau$: Torque ($Nm$), $F$: Force ($N$), $D_\perp$: Perpendicular distance between the forces
## Equilibrium
- For an object to be in equilibrium, it must be in rotational and translational equilibrium
- ==Translational equilibrium means that there is no resultant force in any direction==
- Rotational equilibrium is also known as the principle of moments
- ==The principle of moment states that for an object in equilibrium, the sum of the clockwise moments about any axis is equal to the sum of the anti-clockwise moments about the same axis==
### Two forces
- Consider two forces actin on an object, $T$ and $W$
- For translational equilibrium, $T=W$
- For rotational equilibrium, the lines of $T$ and $W$ must coincide
### Three forces
- A closed triangle can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and direction
- The traingles follow each other around the triangle, clockwise or anti-clockwise
- In a free body diagram, the lines of action of the tree forces must pass through a common point
### More than three forces
- A closed polygon can be drawn to represent the forces in magnitude and driection
- The forces must follow each other around the polygon, clockwise or anti-clockwise
