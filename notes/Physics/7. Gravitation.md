## Law of universal gravitation
- ==Every two particles with masses $m_1$ and $m_2$ attract each other with a force which is proportional to the product of their masses, and inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart==
  $$F=\frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}$$
- $F$: Gravitational force ($N$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67\times10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $m$: Mass of the point mass ($kg$), $r$: distance ($m$)
- The expression is only valid for point masses, but, for a point outside uniform uniform spheres, the sphere behaves like a point mass with its mass concentrated at the center
- Gravitational attraction between any two objects is mutual and they form an action-reaction pair
### Gravitational field
- ==A gravitational field is a region of space in which an object with mass experiences a gravitational force==
- The gravitational field strength can be represented by gravitational field lines; the closer the lines are, the stronger the field
- The lines point in the direction that gravitational force acts, towards the center of the mass producing the field
- The lines do not cross each other, two lines that cross must be added vectorially to give the resultant field
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- Closer to the planet, the lines are more closely spaced, and the field strength is stronger
- Further away from the planet, the lines are more widely spaced, and the field strength is weaker
![[gravitational field lines near the surface of the earth.png]]
- Near the surface of the earth, the lines are nearly parallel to one another, and can be treated as a uniform field
- ==The gravitational field strength at a point in the gravitational field is the gravitational force per unit mass acting on any mass placed at that point==
  $$g=\frac{GM}{r^2}$$
  - $g$: Gravitational field strength ($Nkg^{-1}$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67\times10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass ($Kg$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
  - $g$ is a vector, and an object with mass will experience a gravitational force in the same direction as $g$
### Gravitational field strength and depth
- Let $R$ be the radius of the earth,
- For $r \geq R$:, $g=\frac{GM}{r^2}\rightarrow g\propto\frac{1}{r^2}$ 
- For $r<R$, the field at $P$ is due to the mass $M'$ in the region of earth, hence $g=\frac{GM_1}{r^2}\rightarrow g=\frac{G{\frac{4}{3}\pi r^3\rho}}{r^2}\rightarrow g=\frac{4}{3}G\pi r\rho\rightarrow g\propto r$
- This is assuming if the earth has a uniform density

## Satellite motion
- For a satellite, the gravitational force on the satellite provides the centripetal force for its circular motion, hence $F_G=F_C\rightarrow\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}=mr\omega^2$
### Geostationary satellites
- Geostationary satellites are satellites in circular orbit that are
	- above the equator of the earth
	- moving the same direction as earth's rotation (west to east)
	- has a period equal to the period of earth as it turns about its axis (24 hours)
### Weightlessness in orbit
- Let the mass of the spacecraft and astronaut be $M_s$ and that of earth be $M$
- Since gravitational force = centripetal force, $\frac{GM_sM}{r^2}=mr\omega^2\rightarrow\frac{GM}{r^2}=r\omega^2$ - (1)
- Considering forces on the astronaut of mass $m$, $\frac{GMm}{r^2}-N=mr\omega^2\rightarrow N=0$
- As $N=0$, the astronaut is weightless
### Kepler's third law
- For satellite motion, centripetal force = gravitational force $\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}=mr\omega^2\rightarrow\frac{GMm}{r^2}=mr(\frac{2\pi}{T})^2$
- Thus, 
  $$T^2=\frac{4\pi^2}{GM}r^3$$
  $$T^2\propto r^3$$
### Binary stars
- A binary star system is one where two stars rotate about their common center of mass
- The center of mass is closest to the heavier planet
- A common misconception is that that there is a mass at the common center of mass, when there isn't
![[why binary stars have the same period.png]]
- The will orbit about the center of the mass with the same period
- If they do not have the same period, the line between them will not pass through $O$, the center of rotation
- The resultant gravitational force on each star, which provides the centripetal force will not be directed at $O$, causing them to not rotate about their common center of mass
![[binary stars.png]]
- The larger one has a mass $M_1$, and orbit of radius $R_1$; the smaller one has mass $M_2$ and orbit of radius $R_2$
- The distance between the both planets is $R_1+R_2$, so gravitational force on both planets is 
  $$F_G=\frac{GM_1M_2}{(R_1+R_2)^2}$$
- Since they both have the same angular velocity $\omega$, the centripetal force for $M_1$ and $M_2$
  $$F_{CM_1}=M_1R_1\omega^2; F_{CM_2}=M_2R_2\omega^2$$

## Gravitational potential energy
- ==Gravitational potential energy is the work done by an external agent in bringing a test mass from infinity to the point without a change in kinetic energy==
  $$U=-\frac{GMm}{r^2}$$
- $U$: Gravitational potential energy ($J$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67\times10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass ($Kg$), $m$: Smaller mass ($Kg$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
- Infinity is taken as the zero reference, thus the negative sign is needed as GPE is always lost when travelling from higher GPE to lower GPE
- The negative sign implies
	- the attractive nature of the gravitational nature of the gravitation field
	- $m$ is bound by the gravitational field of $M$
### Escape speed
- Escape speed is the minimum speed that will just allow an object an object to escape to infinity
- For an object to escape (go to infinity and still posses a non-zero KE), at a certain position, the object must have sufficient KE to covert to GPE
- Thus, loss in KE = gain in GPE $\rightarrow \frac{1}{2}mv_{esc}-0=0-(-\frac{GMm}{r})\rightarrow v_{esc}=\sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}$ 
## Gravitational potential
- Gravitational potential is the work done per unit mass by an external agent in bringing an object from infinity to the point
  $$\phi=-\frac{GM}{r}$$
- $\phi$: Gravitational potential ($Jkg^{-1}$), $G$: Gravitational constant ($6.67\times10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$), $M$: Mass ($Kg$), $r$: Distance ($m$)
- An object, regardless of its mass, will move on its own accord from a region of higher potential to a position of lower potential
>[!NOTE]
>Just imagine a ball on a hill when looking at potential graphs
- Scalar
- SI unit of Joules per kilogram ($JKg^{-1}$)
![[gravitational field lines.png]]
- The dashed circular concentric lines are gravitational equipotential lines, which joins points with the same gravitational potential
- The spacing between equipotential lines grows wider apart when we move further away from the planet
- All points on the equipotential lines have the same gravitational potential
- The potential at all points within the same radius will be equal, and different radii have different potentials
- Field lines and equipotential lines are perpendicular to each other
![[addition of potential graphs.png]]
- To add potentials, we can simply add them, and do not need to consider direction as it is a scalar
- We can simply add two potential graphs together to get the resultant potential at each point
## Energy in satellite orbits\
- The total energy of a satellite $E_{total} = KE +U$
- For satellite motion, $\frac{GMm}{r^2}=\frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow\frac{GMm}{r}=mv^2\rightarrow\frac{GMm}{2r}=\frac{1}{2}mv^2=KE$
- Therefore, $$E_{total} = \frac{GMm}{2r} - \frac{GMm}{r} = -\frac{GMm}{2r}$$
- The minus sign in the expression for total energy indicates that the system is a closed one
- The satellite has to be supplied with energy from an external source before it can tear away from the attraction of the earth

### Relationships
- The gradient of a $U-r$ graph is the negative of the gravitational force acting on the object
- The area under the $F-r$ graph is the change in gravitational potential energy $$F = -\frac{GMm}{r}, U =-\frac{GMm}{r} \rightarrow F = -\frac{dU}{dr}$$
![[F - U relationship.png]]
- The negative of the gradient of the $\phi-r$ graph  is the gravitational field strength at that point
- The area under the $g-r$ graph is the change in gravitational potential $$g = -\frac{GM}{r}, \phi =-\frac{GM}{r} \rightarrow g = -\frac{d\phi}{dr}$$
