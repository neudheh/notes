## Alternating current
- In alternating current, the direction of current flow alternates between the forward and backward direction due to the polarity of the e.m.f. changing periodically with time
- The usual alternating current takes on a sinusoidal waveform
### Characteristics
![[ac current and voltage.png]]
- For a sinusoidal a.c., the direction and magnitude of the current and voltage varies with time in a periodic manner
![[AC terminology.png]]
- A sinusoidal a.c. can be represented by
  $$I=I_0\sin(\omega t)$$
- $I$: Current ($A$), $I_0$: Peak current ($A$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rad^{-1})$ , $t$: time ($s$)
- The voltage can also be represented by $V=V_0\sin(\omega t)$ or $\varepsilon=\varepsilon_0\sin(\omega t)$
- A cycle is one complete alternation of the current
- Period is the time take to complete one cycle
- The frequency is the number of complete cycles per unit time, for the UK and SG is it $50Hz$, for the USA it is $60Hz$
- Instantaneous current is the value of the current at a particular instant of time
- Peak current value $I_0$ is the maximum value of the current in one cycle/ amplitude of the a.c.
- Peak to peak value is the difference between a positive and a negative peak values, for a sinusoidal a.c. it is $2I_0$
- Angular frequency is given by $\omega=2\pi f=\frac{2\pi}{T}$
## Root-mean square (r.m.s.) values
- The average value of a sinusoidal a.c. is zero, which is not representative of the physical situation, as the power dissipated cannot be zero
- The peak value of the a.c. is also not representative of the full cycle
- Since the power dissipated in an external load is proportional to $I^2$ (from $P=I^2R$), the resistor dissipates power, regardless whether it is in the positive or negative direction
- The average value of $I^2$ is thus more representative
- The r.m.s. value of an alternating current/ voltage is the equivalent steady direct current/ voltage that will produce thermal energy at the same average rate in a given resistor
![[rms values.png]]
- Power dissipated by the resistor in the DC source $P=I_{DC}^2R$
- Average power dissipated by the resistor in the AC source $<P>=<I_{AC}^2R>=<I_{AC}^2>R$
- For both resistors to dissipate energy at the same rate $P_{DC}=<P_{AC}>\rightarrow I_{DC}^2R=<I_{AC}^2>R\rightarrow I_{DC}^2=<I_{AC}^2>\rightarrow I_{DC}=\sqrt{<I_{AC}^2>}=I_{rms}$
- By using rms values, many calculations for AC circuits can be done as they would be for DC circuits
### Sinusoidal a.c.
- Current $I=I_0\sin(\omega t)$
- Squaring gives us $I^2=I_0^2\sin^2(\omega t)$
![[r.m.s for sinusoidal AC.png]]
- The average is $\frac{I_0^2}{2}$
- Hence, r.m.s current $I_{rms}=\frac{I_0}{\sqrt{2}}$
## Power dissipated in a resistive load
- A sinusoidal voltage $V=V_0\sin(\omega t)$, is applied across a resistor
- The current $I=\frac{V}{R}=\frac{V_0\sin(\omega t)}{R}=\frac{V_0}{R}\sin(\omega t)=I_0\sin(\omega t)$
- Therefore both current and voltage vary sinusoidally with the same angular frequency $\omega$ and are in phase
![[power in ac.png]]
- Power $P=I^2R=I_0^2R\sin^2(\omega t)=P_0\sin^2(\omega t)$
  $$P=P_0\sin^2(\omega t)$$
- Maximum power $P=I_0R=\frac{V_0^2}{R}=I_0V_0$
- Mean power $<P>=<P_0sin^2(\omega t)>=P_0<sin^2(\omega t)>=\frac{P_0}{2}$
  $$<P>=\frac{P_0}{2}$$
- $<P>=\frac{P_0}{2}=\frac{I_0V_0}{2}=\frac{I_0}{2}\frac{V_0}{2}=I_{rms}V_{rms}$
- $<P>=\frac{P_0}{2}=\frac{I_0^2R}{2}=\frac{I_0^2}{r}R=I_{rms}^2R$
- $<P>=\frac{P_0}{2}=\frac{V_0^2}{2R}=\frac{V_0^2}{2}\frac{1}{R}=\frac{V_{rms}^2}{R}$
- $P$: Power ($W$), $V$: Voltage ($V$), $I$: Current ($A$), $R$: Resistance ($\Omega$)
## Transformers
- A transformer is a device that takes the voltage of an alternating supple and changes it to another alternating voltage
- It is made out of two coils of insulated wires wound on a soft iron core, which are known as the primary and secondary coils
![[transformer.png]]
- An alternating e.m.f. $V_P$ is applied across the primary coil, generating an alternating current in the primary coil $I_P$ that is in phase with $V_P$
- This sets up an alternating magnetic flux $\phi$ that is in phase with $I_P$
- The magnetic flux in the soft iron core, which improves the magnetic flux linkage between the primary and secondary coils, is linked to the secondary coil
- Since $\phi$ is changing, by Faraday's law of electromagnetic induction, e.m.f. $V_S$ will be induced in the secondary coil
- $V_S$ is proportional to the rate of change of magnetic flux, so it will alternate at the same frequency as $V_P$
- If a load is connected to the secondary circuit, a current $I_S$ will flow in the secondary coil and transfer energy from the primary circuit to the load
- We can also neglect the resistance of the coils and assume all of the magnetic flux is confined tot he iron core, so that magnetic flux is the same in each turn of the coils
- For an ideal transformer, the power supplied from the primary coil will be fully transferred to the secondary output ($V_PI_P=V_SI_S\rightarrow\frac{V_S}{V_P}=\frac{I_P}{I_S}$)
- We can also prove that $\frac{V_S}{V_P}=\frac{N_S}{N_P}$, where $\frac{N_S}{N_P}$ is there turns ratio
- Hence, $\frac{V_S}{V_P}=\frac{N_S}{N_P}=\frac{I_P}{I_S}$
- $V$: Voltage ($V$), $N$: Number of turns in the coil, $I$: Current ($A$)
- All the values can be peak values or rms values, but not a mixture of both
- $N_S>N_P$ -> Step-up transformer; $N_S<N_P$: Step-down transformer
- Transformers only work with a.c. and not d.c. because alternating magnetic fields are required
- D.c. can only produce steady magnetic fields
- We can use a pulsed d.c. to create a changing magnetic field but it is not as easy as generating a sinusoidal a.c.
### Power losses
- Cooper losses due to joule heating when the current flows in the copper wires associated with the transformer
	- Minimised by using thicker wires
- Iron losses due to eddy currents set up by the alternating magnetic flux in the iron core
	- Reduced by using a laminated core, made up of sheets of iron which are electrically insulated from one another, reducing the size of eddy currents
- Flux leakage due to incomplete linkage for primary magnetic flux with the secondary coil
	- The design of the core and its shape will determine the level of flux leakage
- Hysteresis loss due to continuous changes in the magnetisation of the soft iron core, generating thermal energy
	- This can be reduced by careful selection of the core material
### Transmission
- Let the power generated by $P_{gen}$ be delivered at a transmission voltage $V_{tr}$
- Current in the cables will be $I=\frac{P_{gen}}{V_{tr}}$
- Power losses in the cables $P_{loss}=I^2R=(\frac{P_{gen}}{V_{tr}})^2R\rightarrow P_{loss}\propto\frac{1}{V_{tr}^2}$
- The higher the voltage at which is transmitted, the lower the power loss in the cable, hence electricity is transmitted at high voltage and low current
- Near the consumer, step-down transformers lower the voltage for a value suitable for use in home
## Rectification
- Rectification refers to the process of converting d.c. into a.c.
- A diode is a device that allows current to flow in one direction only
![[half wave rectification.png]]
- The diode conducts from $t=0-\frac{T}{2}$ when in is forward biased (terminal A is positive with respect to terminal B)
- A pulse of current flows around the circuit
- The voltage drop across R is approximately equal to the input voltage, and the voltage drop across the wires diode and internal resistance of the power supply is negligible
- From $t=\frac{T}{2}-T$, the diode is reverse biased (terminal B is positive with respect to terminal A)
- No current flows and the voltage across R is zero
- The rectified p.d. across R thus appears as a series of pulses (half a sine wave), and the current is present in the circuit for only half of each cycle
