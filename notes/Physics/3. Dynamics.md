## Newton's first law of motion
- ==Newton's first law states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and an object in motion tends to stay in motion with the same velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force==
### Inertia
- Inertia is the tendency of an object to continue in its original motion
- Inertia is dependent on the mass of an object, the greater the mass of the body, the less it accelerates under the action of a given applied force
## Linear momentum
- ==Linear momentum of an object moving with a velocity is the product of the mass and the velocity ==$$p = mv$$
- $p$: Momentum ($N s$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $v$: Speed ($ms^{-1}$)
- It is a vector
- SI unit of $kgms^{-1}$ or $Ns$
## Newton's second law
- ==Newton's second law states that the rate of change of momentum is proportional to the net force acting on the object, and this change in momentum takes place in the direction of the force== $$F \propto \frac{dp}{dt}$$
  $$F \propto \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
-  Since we are using SI units, $$F = \frac{d(mv)}{dt}$$
  $$F = m \frac{dv}{dt} + v\frac{dm}{dt}$$
  $$F =ma$$
  - $F$: Force ($N$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $a$: acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
### Impulse
  - The area under an $F-t$ graph is known as the impulse
  - From newton's second law, $$F = \frac{dp}{dt} \rightarrow \int{dp} dt = \int{F}dt = Area\ under\ F-t\ graph$$
  - Hence, this gives the impulse momentum theorem which states that the impulse of the force acting on the object is equal to the change in momentum of the object $$Change\ in\ momentum\ \Delta p = Impulse\ I = Area\ under\ F-t\ graph$$
## Newton's third law
- ==Newton's third law states that if body A exerts a force on body B, then body B will exert and equal and opposite force on body A==
- The forces are equal in magnitude and opposite in direction to the force that caused it
- They act on different bodies so they do not cancel each other out
### Weightlessness
- Weightless ness refers to a state of being in free fall, in which there is no perceived support (i.e. no reaction force on the person by any support)
- This is becuase one's feeling of weight come from the fact that there is a normal force from their weight acting on them
- E.g. Lift cable breaks, going over the top of a roller coaster, being in orbit
## Principle of conservation of momentum
- ==The principle of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of the system before the collision is equal to the total momentum of the system after the collision, provided no external force acts on the system==
- Consider a mass A travelling with velocity $U_A$ colliding with mass B with velocity $U_B$
- During the collision, the two masses are in contact and exert a force $F$ on each other, for a time $t$
- By newton's second law, on A, $$F_A=m_A\frac{V_A-U_A}{t}$$
- For B, $$F_B=m_B\frac{V_B-U_B}{t}$$
- By newton's third law, $$F_B=-F_A$$
- Rearranging, $$m_AU_A+m_BU_B=m_AV_A+m_BV_B$$
- $m$: Mass ($kg$), $U$: Initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $V$: Final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
### Elastic collisions
- For an inelastic collision, the total momentum is conserved, but total energy is not conserved
- For an elastic collision, the total momentum and the total energy is conserved
- For an elastic collision, we can deduce that the relative speed of approach is equal to the relative speed of separation
- Consider two masses A and B colliding elastically with velocities $U_A$ and $U_B$
- Conservation of momentum,$$m_AU_A+m_BU_B=m_AV_A+m_BV_B$$
- Conservation of kinetic energy, $$\frac{1}{2}m_AU_A^2+\frac{1}{2}m_BU_B^2=\frac{1}{2}m_AV_A^2+\frac{1}{2}m_BV_B62$$
- Rewriting conservation of momentum, $$m_A(U_A-V_A)=m_B(V_B-U_B)$$
- Rewriting conservation of kinetic energy, $$m_A(U_A^2-V_A^2) = m_H(V_B^2-U_B^2)$$
- Taking equation 2 / 1 gives $$U_A+V_A = V_B + U_B$$
  $$U_A - U_B = V_B - V_A$$
- $m$: Mass ($kg$), $U$: Initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $V$: Final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
