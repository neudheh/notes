- ==The source of any wave is a vibration or oscillation==
- ==Waves provide a mechanism for the transfer of energy from one point to another without the physical transfer of material between the points==
## Types of waves
### Mechanical waves
- Mechanical waves are waves that need a medium for the transfer of energy
- The particles in the wave carry potential and kinetic energies
- They cannot travel through a vacuum
- E.g. water waves, sound waves
- The particles undergo oscillations for energy to be transported through space and time
- When the medium is disturbed, an atom is displaced from its equilibrium position
- Inter-atomic forces connecting the atom to neighbouring atoms will cause the atoms to also displace from their equilibrium positions
- The disturbance form the first atom will spread through the medium, resulting in a wave that carries mechanical energy away from the first atom to the rest of the material
### Non-mechanical waves
- Non-mechanical waves are waves that do not need a medium for the transfer of waves
- The energy in the waves is carried by oscillating electric and magnetic fields
- They can travel through vacuums
- E.g. EM waves such as light, radio, x-ray
### Progressive waves
- Progressive waves is one where the wave profile moves in the direction of progression of the waves
- They transfer energy from one point to another
### Transverse waves
- ==A transverse waves is one where the direction of the vibration of the wave particles is perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- Every wave but a sound wave
### Longitudinal waves
- A longitudinal wave is one where the direction of vibration of the wave particles is parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave
- It is made up of a series of compressions and rarefaction
- Compressions are where the concentration of air particles is the highest, and atmospheric pressure is the highest
- Rarefactions are where the concentration of air particles is the lowest, and atmospheric pressure is the lowers
## Terms used to describe waves
### Displacement-distance graph
- The graph is like a camera snapshot of the wave
![[displacement-distance graph.png]]
- Displacement is the distance of a particle from its equilibrium position
- Equilibrium position is the position of the wave particle when there is no wave motion
- Amplitude is the maximum displacement of a wave particle from its equilibrium position
- Wavelength is the distance between two consecutive particles in the wave whose motions are in phase with one another (P and P')
- The wave velocity is the velocity which the wave profile (shape) advances
- Energy is transferred through space at this speed
### Displacement-time graph
- The displacement-time graph shows the change in position of one particle in the wave over time
![[displacement-time graph.png]]
- Period is the time taken for one wave particle in the wave to complete one oscillation, or the time taken for the wave to move a distance of one wavelength
- Frequency is the number of complete oscillation undergone by a wave particle per unit time, or the number of crests that pass through a given point per unit time
  $$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
  - $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
## Phase and phase difference
- Phase is the state of disturbance of the particle, or the stage of oscillation the particle is in
- Two points that are in phase means that they are precisely in the same state of disturbance (e.g. any two crests/ troughs)
- A crest and a trough are $180\degree/\pi rad$ out of phase, and are always moving in opposite directions
### Calculating from distance
![[phase diff from distance.png]]
$$\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\times2\pi$$
- $\Delta\phi$: Phase difference ($rad$), $\Delta x$: Distance ($m$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$)
- P leads Q by $\frac{\pi}{2}rad$; Q lags P by $\frac{\pi}{2}$ rad
### Calculating from time
![[phase diff from time.png]]
$$\Delta\phi=\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times2\pi$$
- $\Delta\phi$: Phase difference ($rad$), $\Delta t$: Difference in time ($s$), $T$: Period($s$)
## Basic wave equation
- A wave particle takes one period to complete one oscillation, and travels one wavelength
- Hence, $$v=\frac{\lambda}{T}=f\lambda$$
- $v$: Wave speed ($ms^{-1}$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $T$: Period ($s$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
## Equations to describe a wave
### Displacement-distance
$$y=A\sin\theta=A\sin(\frac{\Delta x}{\lambda}\times2\pi)=A\sin kx$$
- $y$: Displacement ($m$), $A$: Amplitude ($m$), $\theta$: Phase ($rad$), $\Delta x$: Distance ($m$), $\lambda$: Wavelength ($m$), $k$: Wave number ($\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}radm^{-1}$)
### Displacement-time
$$y=A\sin\theta=A\sin(\frac{\Delta t}{T}\times2\pi)=A\sin\omega t$$
- $y$: Displacement ($m$), $A$: Amplitude ($m$), $\theta$: Phase ($rad$), $\Delta t$: Time ($s$), $T$: Period ($s$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($\frac{2\pi}{T} rads^{-1}$)
### Longitudinal wave
![[how to get pressure distance graph.png]]
- A longitudinal wave whose wavelength is equal to the distance between particles
- Draw on the axis the position of all nine particles at an instant when particle 1 is at its rightmost amplitude position
- Taking displacement to the right of the equilibrium position as positive y-displacement, we can obtain the curve as shown
## Intensity and amplitude
- Intensity is the energy transmitted per unit time across unit area of a surface perpendicular to the direction of energy flow
  $$Inestity=\frac{Power}{Area}=\frac{Energy}{Time\times Area}$$
- For a mechanical wave, with each particle executing simple harmonic motion, the total mechanical energy per molecule $E=\frac{1}{2}m\omega^2A^2=\frac{1}{2}m(2\pi f)^2A^2$
- $E$: Energy ($J$), $m$: Mass of molecule ($Kg$), $\omega$: Angular frequency ($rad s^{-1}$), $A$: Amplitude ($m$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
- Hence, $I =\frac{\frac{1}{2}m(2\pi f)^2A^2}{Time\times Area}\rightarrow I\propto f^2A^2$
- For a wave with fixed frequency, $$I\propto A^2$$
- $I$: Intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $A$: Amplitude ($m$)
### Wave energy from a point source
![[dispersion of wave energy from a point source.png]]
- The intensity of a wave will diminish with increasing distance from the source
- The wave energy spreads out uniformly in all directions from the point source and travels without a loss in energy
- The emitted power is spread out uniformly over the surface of a sphere as shown
- Since $Intensity=\frac{Power}{Area}$, $I=\frac{P}{4\pi r^2}$
- Therefore,$$I\propto\frac{1}{r^2}$$
- $I$: Intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $r$: Radius ($m$)
## Polarization
- ==Polarization is the effect of making wave oscillations limited to a single planar direction perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the wave==
- Longitudinal waves cannot be polarized, as particles in a longitudinal wave vibrate parallel to the direction of propagation of the wave, and the amplitude cannot be cut off
- Electromagnetic waves are transverse waves consisting of varying electric and magnetic fields that oscillate perpendicular to the direction of propagation
- E.g. Light
- But, the electric and magnetic fields vibrate in any randomly oriented plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation, which is called unpolarized light
- It composes of many waves with all possible directions of polarization
- We can polarize them using polarizing filters
- Only light polarized in the direction parallel to the axis of polarization of the polarizer is able to pass through it, and the resulting oscillations are only in one direction
  ![[polarization of EM waves.png]]
 
 >[!NOTE]
 >The intensity of light after passing through one polariser is half its original intensity
### Malus law
- If an polarized EM wave is incident upon a polarizer, only the component parallel to the polarizing axis of the polarizer will be transmitted
- The component that is perpendicular to the axis will be blocked
  ![[malus law.png]]
- Using $I\propto A^2$, Initial intensity: $I_0 = kA_0^2$
- Amplitude of transmitted wave $A_t = A_0\cos(\theta)$
- Transmitted intensity: $I_t=kA_t^2=k(A\cos\theta)^2$
- Therefore, $$I_t=I_0\cos^2\theta$$
- $I_t$: Transmitted intensity($Wm^{-2}$), $I_0$: Initial intensity ($Wm^{-2}$), $\theta$: Angle between the incident wave and axis of polarization
## Measuring the frequency of sound using a cathode-ray oscilloscope

![[CRO to determine sound frequency.png]]
- C.R.O on the time base setting
- The microphone detects pressure variation in air and converts them into electric signals to be fed into the C.R.O.
- The C.R.O. then plots a pressure time graph, which is equivalent to a displacement time graph for one particle
- The period can be measured from the screen, and the frequency can be found suing $f = \frac{1}{T}$
