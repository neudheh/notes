## Uniform circular motion
- When an object moves along a circular path with constant speed, the motion is called uniform circular motion
- We cannot use the 4 kinematics equations as the direction of acceleration is always changing and is not constant
## Angular displacement
- ==Angular displacement is the angle an object makes with respect to a reference line ==
$$\theta=\frac{s}{r}$$
- $\theta$: angular displacement ($rad$), $s$: arc length, $r$: radius of the circle
## Angular velocity
- ==Period is the time taken for one complete revolution==
- ==Frequency is the number of complete revolutions made per unit time==
$$f=\frac{1}{T}$$
- $f$: Frequency ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$)
- ==Angular velocity is the rate of change of angular displacement==
- Since in one revolution, $\theta=2\pi rad$,
$$\omega=\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f$$

- $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rads^{-1}$), $\theta$: Angular displacement ($rad$), $t$: time ($s$), ($Hz$), $T$: Period ($s$), $f$: Frequency ($Hz$)
## Tangential velocity
- ==Tangential velocity is the linear velocity of a point moving inside of a circle, which is directed tangentially to the circular path==
- Differentiating $s=r\theta$ (from $\theta=\frac{s}{r}$), 
$$v=r\omega=\frac{2\pi r}{T}$$
- $v$: Tangential velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $r$: Radius ($m$), $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rads^{-1}$),  $T$: Period ($s$)
## Centripetal acceleration
- Consider a mass $m$ moving along a circular path of radius $r$ with uniform speed $v$
- At $A$, its velocity is $V_A$, in the direction $AC$; at $B$, the velocity is in direction $V_B$ in direction $BD$
- The directions of the velocities are different, making the velocities different, which causes a change in acceleration 
![[centripetal acceleeration.png]]
- The change in velocity can be seen from the velocity diagram, and the direction of the change in velocity is the direction of the change in acceleration
- From the vector diagram, $\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})=\frac{\frac{1}{2}\Delta v}{v}$,
- If $\theta$ is small, then $\sin(\frac{\theta}{2})\approx\theta \rightarrow \Delta v=v\theta$
- Acceleration $a =\frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t}=\frac{v\theta}{t}$
$$a=v\omega=r\omega^2=\frac{v^2}{r}$$
- $a$: Acceleration ($ms^{-2}$), $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rads^{-1}$), $v$: Tangential velocity ($ms^{-1}$), $r$: Radius ($m$)
- The direction of acceleration must be perpendicular to the direction of motion, and it is directed towards the center of the circle
## Centripetal force
- Newton's first law states that an object that is already moving will continue to move with the same uniform speed in a straight line unless compelled to do otherwise
- Hence, to cause an object to execute uniform circular motion, an external force must act on the object
- By newton's second law, $$F=mr\omega^2=\frac{mv^2}{r}=mv\omega$$
- $F$: Centripetal force ($N$), $m$: Mass ($kg$), $r$: Radius ($m$), $\omega$: Angular velocity ($rads^{-1}$), $v$: Tangential velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
- Centripetal force is not a new type of force
- Centripetal force acts perpendicularly to the direction of motion so that speed can be kept constant
- Centripetal force must act radially inwards as centripetal acceleration is towards the center of the circle
- Sudden removal of the force would allow the object to move along the tangent to the circle's motion
- No work is done as the force is perpendicular to the motion of the object throughout the circular motion
## Horizontal circle
### Why do cyclists lean when turning
![[Cyclist leaning.png]]
- Vertically, $N=mg$,
- Horizontally, $f=\frac{mv^2}{r}$
- The centripetal force needed for the cyclist to turn is provided by friction $f$ acting on the bicycle
- The force provides a clockwise moment about the center of gravity of the cyclist, causing him to turn outwards
- To achieve rotational equilibrium, the cyclist must lean inwards so that normal force produces an anti clockwise moment about the center of gravity of the cyclist
### Banking
![[car without banking.png]]
- Vertically, $W=N$
- Horizontally, $f=\frac{mv^2}{r}$
- As the car travels faster, the centripetal acceleration required to maintain the same radius increases
- The friction needed to produce the acceleration must increase
- At some speed, the force required to keep the car on the circular path will be greater than the maximum friction provided by the track, and the car will skid off
- We can bank the road
![[banking.png]]
- The normal force is no longer vertical, and has a horizontal component which provides the centripetal force for the car
- Vertically, $N\cos\theta=mg$ - (1)
- Horizontally, $N\sin\theta=\frac{mv^2}{r}$ - (2)
- (2)/(1), $\tan\theta=\frac{v^2}{rg}$
- The angle of banking is idea l if there is no need to provide the centripetal force, only the horizontal component of normal force is providing the centripetal force needed
## Vertical circle
- A vertical circular motion is not uniform as the object speed changes due to gravity
- The object speeds up as it moves downwards, and slow down as it approaches the top
  ![[bucket of water.png]]
- At the top, $T_{top}+mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}$
- At the bottom, $T_{bottom}-mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}$
- Tension in the rod is changing as the object moves, smallest at the top and largest at the bottom

### Why won't the water in the bucket fall
![[water in a bucket.png]]
- For the bucket to move in a circle, there must be a centripetal force acting on it
- The weight of the water and the normal contact force exerted at the bottom of the bucket provide the centripetal force
- As long as the normal contact force is zero or greater, the water will stay in the bucket
- Hence, the water will not fall out of the bucket as long as the bucket is moving at a higher enough speed such that the centripetal force is larger than or equal to the weight of the water 
### Graph of tension

## Non-uniform circular motion in a vertical circle
![[loop the loop.png]]
- At the top, $N_{top}+mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow N_{top}=\frac{mv^2}{r}-mg$,
- At the bottom, $N_{bottom}-mg=\frac{mv^2}{r}\rightarrow N_{bottom}=\frac{mv^2}{r}+mg$
- Comparing the normal force at the bottom and top, $N_{bottom}>N_{top}$
- The car is more likely to lose contact at the top
### Minimum speed
- The minimum speed at the top can be found when the normal force is equal to 0 such that the car still just remains in contact with the track
- $0 =\frac{mv^2}{r}-mg\rightarrow v=\sqrt{mr}$
- We can find the minimum speed at the bottom taking energy considerations, since total KE at the bottom = total final KE and GPE at the top
- $\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}^2=\frac{1}{2}mv_{top}^2+mg(2r)\rightarrow\frac{1}{2}mv_{bottom}^2=\frac{1}{2}(mr)+mg(2r)\rightarrow\sqrt{5gr}$
